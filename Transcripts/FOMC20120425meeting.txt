Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on April 24-25, 2012

April 24 Session

words about our communications efforts.  As you know, we all considerable interest in trying to improve our communication-in particular, to do what guidance more state-contingent, more explicit in terms of what the I think it's something we need to keep persisting at. way to calibrate our reaction functions.  I commend CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon, everybody.  I'd like to briefly introduce our first agenda item with a few have a we can to make our forward factors are that we will be looking at in making decisions about changing the stance of policy.  I know we've been doing this for a while, but So one way to do that would be to put out alternative scenarios, get Committee participants' reactions to those scenarios, and use that as a the staff for taking the initiative to put together these scenarios that we'll discuss today, and we'll see how that works.

approach to discovering our reaction function is through policy rules, and I everybody knows that in the June meeting, we'll be having a presentation and communication and for decisionmaking.  I think presence of a zero lower bound and also in the would call to your attention a number of pieces of work that you received recently that rules based on the SEP results, which has also been done by three Reserve certainly work before the prior meeting, couple of staff memos and President Kocherlakota's response to the memo on An alternative want to make sure discussion of policy rules and their use both for it's important that we think about them in the absence of a zero lower bound.  I have already been circulated bearing on rules, including the nice effort estimated Taylor Banks that have done similar work.  I think that work shows that while there are important differences across participants, there are also some areas of commonality, and that's maybe something we can build on.  We also had some interesting including a

a lot already there, and we've had some good discussions, but again, I think LSAPs.  So there's this is an important direction.  And I urge everybody to keep thinking about these issues and to participate actively in our discussion in June.

I want to do now is turn to Thomas Laubach, whom we welcome back to the years ago.  Thomas is going to report on the scenarios exercise, and would be interested to hear anyone So-Thomas. What Federal Reserve after some absence.  Thomas was a coauthor of mine, and we worked on a book on inflation targeting many after he reports, we'll have a chance for Q&amp;A.  And then I who has any views on whether this is a constructive direction and, if it is, what further steps we might take.

you called 'Material for Alternative Scenarios for Contingency Planning.' you suggested that a discussion of alternative would your internal also be used to provide more information to the public your thinking.  To explore the potential of this idea, we sent you a memo that next six your views on how an experiment and that the your MR. LAUBACH. 1   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'll be referring to the handout in front of At the March meeting, several of scenarios could provide a means for the Committee to consider how policy respond to different contingencies-something that could both facilitate policy discussion and possibly about outlined four different scenarios for the evolution of the economy over the months, and then asked you a few questions intended to elicit policy might respond to these developments.  You all joined the game, and your responses to our questions were, we think, quite informative.  Before reviewing them, however, we should emphasize that this exercise was only results should thus be interpreted cautiously.  In addition, our categorization of responses required, in some cases, a little judgment on our part, and others might score the results somewhat differently.

you said that scenario 1-the consistent with the March Tealbook forecast-was the one closest to your panel shows that nine of you opted you thought the stronger activity of scenario 2 was more you chose the modest growth and somewhat higher inflation of you resisted our attempt to shoehorn you into one and said that a mix of scenario 1 with either 2 or 3 was most The main results from the survey are summarized in the top panel of the first page of the handout.  As noted by the first bullet, most of scenario own modal outlook.  Specifically, the middle-left for scenario 1, while three of likely, and two of scenario 4.  Finally, three of scenario or the other, likely.

of you thought that the differences across from scenario to scenario in your outcome was not obvious to us all that different relative to the uncertainty months ahead.  In any event, the middle-right table your assessments of appropriate policy in scenarios 2, 3, and 4 differed from your own assessment of appropriate policy in scenario 1. you thought that scenarios 2 and 4 would call for less change in accommodation, we include changes in your liftoff as Returning to the upper panel, most scenarios were large enough to merit adjustments individual assessment of appropriate policy.  This beforehand because the scenarios were not associated with forecasts six summarizes how qualitatively Excluding four participants, for whom we were not able to infer their views on this issue, almost all of accommodation relative to scenario 1, while scenario 3 would call for more accommodation.

you also provided information on the appropriateness of additional noted in the third bullet of the top you said that additional asset purchases or actions to increase the additional LSAPs or portfolio actions would be appropriate in appropriate, depending on the balance Many of balance sheet actions in the various scenarios.  As panel, 10 of duration of the SOMA portfolio would be, or at least could be, appropriate in response to the relatively weak economic conditions of scenario 3.  In addition, 4 of you mentioned that scenario 1, and another 2 thought they could be of risks.

The results are summarized in the table at the bottom.  As shown in you favor easing policy further.  In response to the stronger activity of scenario 2, less accommodative policy than that now in generally by bringing forward the expected liftoff date for the funds rate.  A inflation conditions of scenario 4. you favored easing relative to current policy under the relatively As noted under the information for us to infer preserving the purchases or a new MEP-should be maintained or modified in each scenario. our purposes, we score and, conversely, delaying the date as an MEP, or adopting 'aggressive' thresholds for inflation and unemployment are also scored as the first column, 8 participants favor maintaining the status quo in scenario 1, while 3 of however, 13 of you favored announcing a place, very similar result holds for the somewhat higher In contrast, 12 of weak conditions of scenario 3, primarily by purchasing additional assets or by lengthening the duration of the portfolio.  In this context, 3 of you expressed doubts that pushing the date-related forward guidance beyond late 2014 would be credible.

you made it your policy assessments depend not only on your modal outlooks for real assessments of downside and upside risks. policy, which several of you thought year. Returning to the upper panel, the final bullet notes that several of clear that activity and inflation, but also on your Among the downside risks mentioned was fiscal could be particularly important later this

As noted in the second bullet, you cited a additional measures of financial of financial stress, measures of foreign economic conditions ISM.  Five of you also highlighted the importance of future that general Turning to the second exhibit, we also asked whether additional information on the economy helpful in answering questions about the four scenarios.  As indicated by the first bullet, many judging the appropriate response of monetary policy in the data for number of examples; most frequently mentioned were inflation and inflation expectations, house prices, a broader array of variables and indicators and trade, additional labor market indicators such as initial claims, and survey data on business conditions such as the anecdotal information from business contacts.  Based on this feedback, any exercise may therefore require more information-with the caveat that scenarios are very complex and specific may be of limited help in advancing a discussion about the appropriate policy response to changes in economic conditions.

you questioned the general In particular, some of you noted that the scenario descriptions might play out over time.  Although we left out this information to preserve time' spirit of the exercise, some of you suggested that these exercises years into the future.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Certainly.

First, I want to thank Thomas for I'm saying, how can you put socks on this octopus or, because there are 17, nonapus-or whatever 17 are?  This is very helpful.  Actually, Mr. Chairman, I found this exercise, plus the background material on LSAPs and MEP, to address what

April 24-25, 2012

and income effects that might occur as a result of one of those LSAP and the MEP confuse the public is another question.  So I design flaws that others felt were inherent in I also want to thank Bill in front of the table for helping us get a sense, with that of the different alternative scenarios we might envision.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. meeting.  And just for the record, I was right when I said that with alternative scenarios, we didn't enumerate the balance sheet alternative scenarios obtaining.  I want to thank Bill English in front of the table for working with Evan Koenig and our staff in Dallas, and there's some of that in the memo.  But from the standpoint of just getting us to think, going through this exercise is useful. Whether or not it would be useful to the public or was happy to hear Thomas say that it was experimental, and we might think about what we might do with this next, including addressing the this exercise. LSAP memo and the MEP memo, of the costs and possible downsides as well as some of the advantages

I'm still in question mode, if there are any questions.  If not, certainly take comments.  Vice Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. we can

I think I'm the outlier here in terms of how I It was a useful exercise, and the surprising thing was how much people in light of what were really relatively modest I'd just explain why I ended up in a very different you.  The first reason is, the differences in the scenarios had very small that if you specified more about the financial variables, then you might be able to infer I don't think the scenarios, as they cast, had very strong implications for 2013 and 2014. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes. reacted to the scenarios. actually adjusted their monetary policy forecasts differences in the scenarios.  So I thought place than many of implications for what was going to happen in 2013 and 2014.  Now, obviously, Thomas made the point more about what would happen over the longer term.  But were

April 24-25, 2012

more divergent, it's not changed my outlook that much, because what's really you risks that are large in terms of their mass and how I think GDP growth is two-tenths firmer or two-tenths weaker over Second, I thought that even if the scenarios had been somewhat clear to me that it would actually have driving my views for 2013 and 2014 are the downside risks.  So you can have a scenario, but still have this issue of how significant the downside risks are.  And right now, with Europe, the U.S. 'fiscal cliff'-those are downside about the outlook relative to whether the next six months.

the fact that we're at the zero lower bound, the consequences of I would want to change my monetary policy outlook.  So I was surprised by that. And then finally, given the downside are not symmetric with the consequences of the upside.  Again, until you actually see a scenario that demonstrably reduces the downside risk significantly, it wouldn't be likely that

I would take this forward, I think it was a useful We should continue to try to see where we can take this.  Given my own personal have scenarios that have greater divergence.  And, in addition, it would good to have the scenarios have a lot more information about what's happening to you can see what the market is anticipating from the takeoff point about how the market is I think that will give us more context in terms of what you might want In terms of recommendations on how exercise. preference, I'd prefer to be very financial market variables, so in the fall of 2012, because that will, in a way, provide more color assessing the scenarios. to do about monetary policy.

Lacker. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions, reactions, comments?  President going to make a comment that I didn't interesting the way you ask questions 3 and 4.  In 3, you asked, 'In MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'm send in anything as part of the last request for comments but it occurs to me on reflecting on this briefing.  I think it's really

April 24-25, 2012

…?' and '… what do you think the scenario would imply for the regarding the appropriate time to begin raising the funds rate …?'  So you sort your forecast?  Is your forecast going to our last discussions haven't left me with a lot about our forward-guidance language.  I'm assuming I was suggesting.  I was one of the ones at the last meeting I was thinking is that it would have been nice if, adopted the language, we had thought through, well, what happens if our forecast months?  Are we going to change the language or not?  And this the scenario closest to your current modal outlook, what would be the outlook for the appropriate stance of monetary policy forward guidance of ask, should we change the appropriate stance of policy?  And, if so, should we change the forward guidance?  You left out, it seems like, 'What is change?'  Now, you may have done that under the presumption that, surely, we would change the forward guidance if our forecast changed, but of certainty that that's how we're thinking that if our collective forecast in some sort of median sense changed, we would change the forward guidance.  And that's what who suggested contingency planning, and what when we advances in time by four doesn't quite get at that.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other comments?  President Evans.

want to thank President Lacker for that comment because it reminded last meeting, a number of people-I looked at the transcript from last as a forecast.  Is it a forecast, or is it a commitment?  And as I went through this I think about this, that it's much Obviously, a date is a forecast, but it also takes into account what the I were asking a question, or not you gained any insights from this scenario analysis beyond just MR. EVANS.  I me of something.  At the time more carefully this time, and there were a number of comments-Jeff made them-about 'late 2014' scenario analysis, I thought about that issue.  It seems to me, as more than just a forecast. policy response function is that everybody has in their mind.  And so if I'd ask the staff whether

April 24-25, 2012

I thought Governor Yellen gave a very insightful speech (1993) response function, you're much earlier than if you're using a Taylor (1999) than if you're using an optimal control type of response. thinking about it, that's so fundamental to this. you have any insights, that would be great. how a different economic scenario plays out-did you gain any insights on what our individual policy reaction functions are?-because last week where she pointed out that on the basis of the same economic outlook from our SEPs, you could come out in different places in terms of when you thought liftoff was.  If you're using a Taylor response function, and both are earlier And so it's understanding that interplay between how the economy, downside risk, and that response function are playing out, plus how we're If very limited extent.  Essentially, we you want, or four alternative scenarios, and then, as the answers to also did not necessarily include all of the information that several My impression is that Vice they did elicit from you can go from what we have asked in these questions.  In would have to ask MR. LAUBACH.  I think the answer is, only to a provided four data points, if question 1 revealed, we participants would find critically important for saying anything about that. the closest we come to this is this particular result that, despite the fact that the scenarios, as Chairman Dudley pointed out, were relatively close to each other, actually many of the participants responses that they would change their views.  So you might see this as an indication that there is a fair degree of responsiveness to changes in economic conditions.  But I'm afraid that that's about as far as order to get a better view on individual response functions, I think we questions that would be much more pointed in that direction.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.

you, Mr. Chairman.  I do have a few remarks on this exercise. MR. BULLARD.  Thank First of all, I don't think that this exercise, as constructed, would do very much to foster

April 24-25, 2012

FOMC policy.  And so let me just elaborate on that for a conducive to improving transparency.  If we actually of outcome uncertainty, but that would add to the information overload. lot of these comments actually echo Vice Chairman Dudley's comments.  The information a wide range of sources.  In principle, one would need a separate each scenario.  We would be saying, in effect, that we do not need all of that also think it's an odd time to put heavy emphasis on the nature of the not been the primary years and likely will not be for years into the future. transparency with the public regarding minute.  This is 17 responses to four scenarios.  That's a maze of 68 possibilities.  I don't think that kind of information overload is very went ahead with something like this, the number of scenarios would have to be expanded to encompass the full range A provided for each scenario is limited.  Normally, the Committee makes decisions based on a wide range of data from Tealbook for analysis to decide what to do in various states of the world.  That would simplify our meetings considerably.  I Committee's interest rate feedback rule.  Adjustment of the policy rate has tool of the Committee for report. that there at the time the report is produced. policy report.  I think the United States is lagging behind other central A better approach, I think, would be to get something like a monetary policy Financial markets and other interested observers crave a digestible Fed view of the many issues that face the U.S. economy.  We could provide this by publishing a quarterly monetary policy report, as other central banks do.  A key advantage of a full report is that all of the important issues and uncertainties can be commented on in some way in the text.  This would provide a baseline both for members of this Committee and for outside observers.  To the extent are differing interpretations of events, this could also be noted and discussed in such a text.  The policy portion could be based on market expectations of policy This is what's done at the Bank of England, for instance.  Alternative scenarios could also be discussed in a monetary

April 24-25, 2012

banks in providing such an assessment.  That would be a better way to go, in my view, as opposed to putting out this maze of information or core dump on what everybody is thinking about policy.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard, how would you manage the input from the participants into the report?

report, and I think the Committee could comment, if all of the points of view or all of the issues had been represented in the MR. BULLARD.  It would be a staff it wanted to, on whether report.  But the report wouldn't try to necessarily come down on every issue.  It could present different issues.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Rosengren.

I thought the exercise was quite interesting.  I'm not sure it was scenarios would help with communication, but it did raise two other I was listening to your presentation.  One is whether you could just directly ask us the inflation-unemployment combinations that would get us to tighten and what ease. MR. ROSENGREN. clear to me how specific thoughts as what would be would be the inflation-unemployment combinations that would get us to ease.  Not so much for communication with the public but for communication with ourselves, it might be useful just to see the mappings that would get people to either tighten or would ease.  We've mapped out in some detail you thought about something would be, that's something we haven't done yet-to address Vice Chairman of what And the second observation was how we how we would tighten.  How we would ease is a little less clear.  If like a more severe scenario, like in the CCAR exercise or something like that, and made us think about what is the appropriate policy or combination of policies that we would think about and what the sequencing Dudley's comment that there are some downside risks.  So having some idea

April 24-25, 2012

and changing actions we would take in the event that we had a second thing that I could a communication tool, other than with people combination of changing language more downside risk than we're currently anticipating would be imagine being useful-again, not so much as around the table.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Tarullo.

you, Mr. Chairman.  I begin from the premise that we're going about the SEP.  My scanning of the second set of results has reinforced whether this is the right alternative, but I wanted first to comment on a monetary policy report, Jim, I'm not sure how around the table are was enough data in there, because I had heard you consistently over the years to be arguing in favor of a more crisply stated reaction function, which one you wanted to what you said. MR. TARULLO.  Thank to need to do something that view.  I don't know what Jim had said.  While I see the virtue of much it's going to communicate to the public if the views of the 17 people actually not particularly incorporated in it, because presumably what the public is most interested in is what they think the future path of policy would be.  And I was a bit surprised when you said you didn't think there last couple of might understand a somewhat stylized scenario to provide.  So I don't know if comment on either of what may have been my misperceptions of advocate of state-contingent policy, but actually was coming from your comment about not putting out too much information because it's just see this as a communications exercise-more agree with Eric, he says, 'Well, just ask everybody to write would do.'  So you could definitely do MR. BULLARD.  No, I'm definitely an I confusing to the public.  But maybe people don't as an internal document.  So if you down a rule that most closely approximates what they that.

April 24-25, 2012

good thing to do.  It wouldn't solve what I think is broadly shared the view that the SEP is going I hope we don't-unless I'm a minority of one are putting this thing out now.  And based on at least my I'm not sure at this point that it's clarifying as much as it is pushing MR. TARULLO.  I noted that Eric was moving in the direction of something that could be used for internal purposes.  That may be a the problem with the SEP, and I don't know how to need some work will end up being.  But again-lose sight of the fact that we discussions with people outside the Fed after the last SEP was released, I do think we need to work on it some, because more information out that's hard to absorb.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.

exercise could be helpful to us, and I was thinking about it largely for encourages all of us to contemplate scenarios also like what the eliciting what we would do in these various scenarios.  I thought it was small changes in scenarios.  That was the At the same time, I'm sympathetic to what the Vice said-that maybe we should have one or two extreme scenarios as well to think about. and then maybe add one or two that are the more idea, I guess, is that you want to have some notion are going to be responding to the outlook.  It sounded like some people want I don't think these things are MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I thought there were a number of reasons why this kind of internal reasons, for fostering internal dialogue.  It other than that in the staff's outlook.  There's a little bit of pushing in two different directions here.  I like Eric's idea of how we would respond to different u 's and π 's.  I staff did in terms of interesting how sensitive people were to relatively interesting piece of information, so maybe we should have scenarios that are small deviations, because that does tell us something. Chairman So I would like to keep the small changes extreme ones.  The problem with the u and π of how some people to respond to a whole wide range of information beyond that.  But

April 24-25, 2012

your closest approximation to what a Taylor-like rule would look like?' internal dialogueof this sort of dream of a monetary But even if we never share any of this with mutually exclusive.  We just don't talk enough about any of this, and so maybe asking all of the participants, 'What's and then also going through this kind of scenario analysis-again, to foster would be useful.  I personally would like to think that a high-level summary discussion could eventually be part of the minutes-or maybe the ultimate policy report, which President Bullard was offering. the public in any detail, it would be valuable for our own internal considerations.

thing I think would be helpful is, when changes are taking place I talking about here?  If we go back and look January 2010, it was predicting the Committee would raise rates in late and core inflation was expected to be forecast for what the Committee would do.  And so the current liftoff are quite different from those that why our reaction function-or the staff's perception of reaction, more correctly-should have changed in the last two years.  And there may be good reaction function in the future.  But I think we should be talking about taking place, and having this kind of scenario analysis-and the that, by making end up implementing changes in our reaction function.  I To be more specific, one in a reaction function, doing this kind of scenario analysis would really help structure those kinds of changes more than we currently do.  So what am at the Greenbook of 2011, when unemployment was expected to be 8.2 percent 1.2 percent.  That was the staff's Tealbook estimates of the conditions surrounding existed just over two years ago.  Now, this is not about whether this is a good thing or a bad thing.  There may well be good reasons our reasons to change our these shifts when they're suggestion Eric made-would make us be more thorough and systematic about the costs and benefits of these kinds of shifts, as opposed to what happens now, which is decisions meeting to meeting, we would see this kind of scenario analysis taking place quarterly or semiannually, and it would

April 24-25, 2012

happy with our Chairman. really facilitate exactly the kind of discussion I have in mind about, are we reaction function, or do we want to change it?  You don't want to be changing it, obviously, every meeting, but when the circumstances require it, you might want to.  Thank you, Mr.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Duke.

you would get more information if you kept narrowing the you found that people didn't react to them in some way as far as a change.  But I thought it was really interesting.  The results were really interesting-how closely as far as when they would be inclined to shift policy.  And then is that I will confess I didn't put nearly as much thought and angst into my answers to I do into making a real decision.  Particularly if we were going to might not be quite so informative if we said what we would do, and then actually, that what we say we would do is actually what we MS. DUKE.  I was just surprised by the suggestion of more divergent scenarios rather than less.  It seems to me that scenarios until that said, everybody seemed to be aligned one caveat hypothetical scenarios as publicize it, it when you get up to it, I'm not entirely sure would do.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other comments?  President Evans.

I made a first intervention as a question, and I just want to be very clear I certainly support the suggestion that we spend more time fleshing out what our individual that President Rosengren made is a good around the table.  How we come to some decision as to whether or not that's a I don't hold out much hope that we have a common policy rule.  But understanding MR. EVANS. that policy reaction functions are.  I think the proposal one-and others common policy rule, as President Kocherlakota was suggesting-we'll have to talk about that a lot more, but

April 24-25, 2012

of the reasons that Janet Yellen's speech indicated. that would be important for many

Thank you.

good idea to follow different strategies see what might work.  I guess I found this most useful in giving me In that respect, it was very useful that these were all pretty realistic, broadly speaking, a consistent around the table-is to try to maybe work backward for a little bit to think about focus, it seems to me, would be on the internal what using such things to inform the your general thinking on this before we do another exercise.  But I found it broadly CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I think it's a or try different things to some sense of what the thresholds might be for changing our overall stance-planning going forward. scenarios that we might in fact confront.  What I would suggest-and I didn't hear message from how it might now be used.  And then perhaps the deliberations first, and then work back and think about policy discussion might imply for the design of subsequent exercises.  Perhaps you could report to us just useful.  President Kocherlakota.

I'll be referring to the packet labeled 'Financial Market Developments and Desk Operations.'  Investors' views economic outlook and policy prospects swung considerably over the intermeeting period, with most U.S. asset prices taking a near their levels at the time of the last FOMC meeting. Europe took more of banking situation intensified once again.

As shown to funds rate implied by futures contracts moved up with the market pricing in meaningful odds that the federal yields, this increase more than fully reversed, leaving the policy path slightly below where it was ahead of the last FOMC meeting. A similar pattern was observed for interest rates at the right, the path of the federal significantly for a time, funds rate would begin to rise well before the second half of 2014.  However, as with longer-term Treasury implied

The current pattern of futures rates implies that market participants see considerable odds that the federal funds rate will be held at its current level at least until the second half of 2014.  This view is corroborated by the Desk's survey of primary dealers.  As shown in the middle-left panel, dealers' views about the likely timing of the first increase in the federal funds target rate were little changed, on balance, over the intermeeting period, with the highest probability still assigned to the second half of 2014.

In addition, as I noted in Of course, the view that short-term interest rates will remain low for a long has been an important factor holding down Treasury my previous briefing, another important factor has been the behavior of the term premium.  As shown in the middle-right panel, the Kim-Wright measure of the term premium has fallen significantly since last summer, moving well below its average level since the late 1990s.

some empirical estimates of the factors that might use those estimates, along with the yield since last June.  The results, reported in the bottom-left panel, a meaningful role in two dimensions. The Tealbook presented explain this pattern in the term premium.  We can change in the expected path of short-term interest rates, to assess the decline in the 10-year Treasury show that Federal Reserve policies have played rate.  This adopted in January, helped push down the expected path of the guidance appears to have contributed to a of uncertainty about interest rates, and hence the amount of premium by 22 basis points. The first dimension is the guidance over the path of the federal funds guidance, including both the 'mid-2013' language adopted last August and the 'late 2014' language federal funds rate, accounting for 31 basis points of the decline in the 10-year yield under this model.  In addition, the policy reduction in the amount risk priced into the term premium.  As shown in the table, the fall in interest rate uncertainty is estimated to have reduced the term

According to the empirical results, the resulting change in SOMA holdings narrowed the term premium another 22 basis points.

However, these have less important than the aggregate effect of the factors related to Federal Reserve The table shows that additional factors also played a role over this period.

Late last year, respondents began to expect an additional asset market participants were expecting a meaningful contraction in the balance sheet over the two-year horizon.  Those expectations moved toward zero in the second half of the year, in part because the FOMC's as postponing the eventual balance sheet exit, given the linkage between these variables in the the balance sheet to expand, reflecting the perceived chances of purchase program.

Your next exhibit turns to developments in Europe and in broader U.S. asset markets.  The most significant development in European financial markets the reemergence of investors' concerns about the sovereign debt and banking situation.  As shown in the upper-left panel, Spanish and Italian sovereign debt spreads increased significantly in recent weeks, nearly returning to the peak reached last fall.  Market participants have been particularly focused on Spain, given setbacks to its planned austerity measures, weak results in some debt auctions, bleak prospects for economic growth, and deepening concerns about

The holdings of European sovereign debt.  As shown by the light-blue bars in the upperright panel, the increase in bank holdings over those several months outstripped the net funding needs of the blue bars.  Thus, the banks were not only covering the net issuance needs but were also holdings.

However, the market has come to realize that there may be a limit to the degree of sovereign risk that the banks are willing to assume, even with ample provision of liquidity.  The prospect of a slowing in bank purchases of sovereign debt, while other investors continue to shed these assets and sovereign borrowing continues, likely has contributed to the renewed upward pressure on the sovereign debt spreads.

The chances assigned to another maturity extension program edged up but remained lower than those of an LSAP, at 20 percent.

an opportunity to ask about the shifts in macroeconomic calibrated in terms of guidance or to further expand the balance The survey also gave us conditions that might lead to policy actions.  These shifts were the midpoint of the central tendency projections from the SEP for the unemployment rate and inflation rate in 2014.  We asked about the changes to these variables that would lead the FOMC to alter the policy sheet.

How do those two things fit together? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  Brian, in figure 5 in exhibit 1, you attributed 50 to 70 basis points in the decline in 10-year to the maturity 100 percent of the decline occurred between July before

That's right.  In the middle of last year, you had several important events. language implemented, and then in September, you had the maturity you don't see a big response, then, to the 'late 2014' language that came in course, there were a lot of things going on at that time in terms of, perhaps, some flight-to-quality flows after the LTROs and so on.  So, of course, the regression is out, but it's not a perfect fit that gets every point of variation. MR. SACK. You had the 'mid-2013' extension program and the reinvestment decision.  I think a lot of the decline in the middle of 2011 was in response to-or, in some cases, in anticipation of-those events.  What's a little more puzzling is that January, but of reversal of trying to parse all of these things But in general, the regression looks at these factors and finds a significant effect for each of them.

Lacker. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President lines up with when you expect the MR. LACKER.  Yes.  I'd like to follow up on that, Mr. Chairman.  So SOMA holdingspresumably, you measure them in some way that

And ask is that I'm wondering how you identify separately the effect of a change in their a change in their anticipation of the path of the an announcement that we deem the economy a bunch of changes in our SOMA holdings. announcement the reason I anticipations of our SOMA holdings from that of federal funds rate, which surely is influenced by and the outlook would warrant

Board staff.  We actually had a MarketSOURCE piece that with a similar model, which I'll come back to.  My understanding is variable that was used is an actual measure of holdings in terms of equivalents.  So it's intended to capture the amount of duration risk brought onto the MR. SACK.  Right.  This is the result that was put in the Tealbook based on Board staff work, so I'm kind of speaking for presented similar material that the SOMA holdings 10-year Federal Reserve's balance sheet.

So we end up with a story where policies overall are having the the actual balance sheet. MR. SACK.  When we buy them.  So over time, it's going to capture the when the actual balance sheet actions are realized. is, the market is going to anticipate those effects and move earlier.  So there's timing mismatch, but the regression should still be able to sort out the effect. MarketSOURCE looking variable about the path of the balance sheet based on what significant in the regression, it actually has a meaningful effect.  But of course, once it's included, it reshuffles same magnitude of effect over this period, but it's just attributing more to the anticipation of the balance sheet rather than

The panel to the right is an expected balance sheet path, and so the fact that become positive is reflecting the anticipation of future policy actions.  In MarketSOURCE regression, it would be captured; in the regression presented in panel 5, it MR. SACK. those expectations have our wouldn't be-it would be an additional effect.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.

you, Mr. Chairman.  Still on the same panel.  On July 29, a was slower than we thought, and right after 1 percentage point, which is a huge thing in the one thing I often cite for this, both for panel 1 and for panel 5, but I don't There could be some difficulties in disentangling the Committee's response to MR. BULLARD.  Thank GDP report was issued.  It revised down U.S. GDP dramatically.  It showed that the recession was deeper than we thought and that the recovery that, the Blue Chip forecast went down by about Blue Chip.  So that's see it on this list. that situation, as opposed to the actual deterioration in the outlook.

I think that's a good point.  What the panel says is that around actually does not what came from the shift in guidance versus what came just from the and the perceived response to that.  So just to be clear, what we're guidance and the balance sheet played some role in MR. SACK.  Absolutely. 30 basis points came from the expected path of the federal funds rate.  It specifically try to identify evolution of the economy saying here is that we believe the policy affecting the expected path of the federal funds rate, in affecting rate uncertainty, and of course,

April 24-25, 2012

holdings.  But for the first two of those, the policy actions aren't the are other things going on that are affecting the expected path of interest around it.  So I don't want people to add up the first three numbers and the balance sheet actions have had a meaningful effect that is reflected in affecting SOMA complete story.  There rates and the uncertainty say, 'Well, that is precisely the effect of our policy actions.'  That would be, obviously, too precise and, as we just said, those numbers involve other things.  What I'm trying to say is that I believe the guidance and in those first three numbers.

going on at the end of contributing to-and you've got that under flight to quality.  But I did want to with just one more question.  On the regression results, can you give me an idea are? MR. PLOSSER.  I was going to ask the same question that President Bullard did for exactly the same reasons.  There was also the turmoil in Europe that was July, which was expand on that of what the standard errors on these numbers

I can give you a related piece of information, which is that the MR. SACK. Rsquared from the regression is 0.71.  So it actually has a lot of explanatory power over this period.

The real question is the identification of some of these things, rather overall R-squared-so, identifying the standard errors of these individual coefficients. MR. PLOSSER. than the

MR. SACK.  Oh, okay.  And on that, another related piece of information.

a regression, wasn't it? MR. PLOSSER.  It was statistics are very significant.  To state the obvious, there's a lot of are a variety MR. SACK.  The t uncertainty surrounding the estimates, and again, I don't think we want to take the results reported in table 5 with too much precision.  They're estimated imprecisely.  There

Lockhart. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President panel 14.  I'd like between alternative A, which called for $400 billion of MEP in, I years or less.  Panel 14 appears to show that the amount of three years $300 billion remaining, and then the amount of three to six years is the practicability of $400 billion as in extent are we actually constrained if we were to consider another round MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  A question regarding to try to connect the dots gather, maturities of four or less is somewhat below quite substantial, actually.  So the question is about alternative A.  To what of MEP, and what do you need to hold for normal open market operations in those maturity sectors?

One of the points of the maturity extension program memo was to calibrate feels could be done.  Obviously, a program of that nature is constrained by ability to do another years.  So years, we pick up a lot of capacity. yield curve so that some of case.  Given the combination of those, constraint there, but we could do the $400 billion.  And I don't see any at the short end of yield curve.  I think we always regarded the ability to sell short-term assets as a backup MR. SACK. how much the staff our holdings of short-term securities.  But the staff is comfortable with our $400 billion program as long as the maturity of the securities sold is extended to four the bottom line is, essentially, with that extension to four And of course, over time, we have securities marching down the what's in the blue line is moving into the red line in any we can get to $400 billion.  We could not do much more in the time horizon that was specified in the memo.  So there is a significant operational consequences of having reduced our holdings sharply the

April 24-25, 2012

assets, but if we sell shorter-term assets, we're having less duration effect and We always regarded it in that way.  What these programs are doing is just taking advantage of that immediately rather than waiting to keep it as draining would say that's the only operational consequence-that it reduces of the draining plan in some sense.  If we were having trouble with the draining tools, of course, we could always sell just more reserve effects. basically capacity in the future.  So I our ability later on to shrink the balance sheet through redemptions or through sales short-term securities.

LOCKHART. Thank you. MR.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.

glad to know that want to go back to panel 4.  I have a question about statements like the one the Committee the longer forward guidance.  Outside observers have expressed a concern poorly, and the other interpretation is, really going to be somewhat offsetting.  Has the staff thought MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Brian, you'll be I made in January, with that those kinds of statements have two kinds of interpretations built into them.  One is that the Committee now sees the economy as doing rather the Committee hasn't changed its views about what the economy is doing, but they just want to provide more stimulus.  So those are about how there might be a way to sort out between those two kinds of forces going on in that kind of forward guidance?

First of all, I think it's, obviously, a very important distinction, and the I think, is the dealer survey that we presented at the last for the liftoff in the federal funds rate.  So a shift in that schedule? MR. SACK. extent to which that information can be communicated is very important.  The piece of evidence that we have that addresses that, briefing, where it showed the perceived thresholds you're asking, are we talking about movements along that schedule or

April 24-25, 2012

I showed in that briefing is that after the longer guidance came in, actually that the rate effect was And one thing schedule shifted down.  So there was some perception, at least partly, that coming from a shift in the reaction function.

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Okay.  Thank you.  That was very helpful.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Duke.

piece, I'm not sure I'm I'm looking at, if I'm reading it correctly, talks about the I read that was that it would be expected to increase 10-year Treasury yields by 20 basis change in the liftoff date and the other half coming So I'm trying to understandLSAP in the other be a reversal of some of the anticipation of additional LSAP that's into the markets.  And would you expect that to be the same for the first another two-quarter move versus another two-quarter move? MS. DUKE.  Brian, when you talk about the MarketSOURCE looking at the same one, but the one likely movement in response to changing the liftoff date to mid-2014 from late 2014.  And the way points, with half of that coming from the from a reduction in estimates of further balance sheet movement. because that ends up being more powerful than the estimate of an additional memo-how much of it may already somehow priced two-quarter move versus

Just to be clear, in terms of the results that are comparable to panel 5, I was about a different MarketSOURCE piece called 'Why Are Treasury Term Premia you brought up is another for thinking about whether a one- or twoor not?  But it ended up making this additional I think is very important, which is connected to what I was showing in panel 6:  The going to have a larger effect on financial conditions because the exit guidance has MR. SACK. actually talking So Low?' which has a similar regression model to this.  But the piece important one, I think.  And that's right; that piece was, first of all, just trying to map financial conditions into this liftoff date to give us a metric quarter increment-is that a big policy increment point that liftoff date is

April 24-25, 2012

effects are based on a forward-looking, anticipated path So that piece has an estimate in it that says, well, basically, changes in the you would have if the only consequence was the funds rate.  And of course, if that's true, policymakers would want to take that to it. tied the balance sheet timing to that date, to the pattern of the federal funds rate.  And of course, the staff believes that the term premium of the balance sheet. liftoff date are essentially twice as powerful as path of the federal into consideration in adjusting that date.  So it's interesting.  That adjustment is very different than other adjustments, like the slope of the policy path after that, because that one, the timing to liftoff, has a lot attached was a big 'if' in your answer. MS. DUKE.  There

estimates, so MR. SACK.  Well, right.  Following on our previous discussion, these are there's a lot of uncertainty.

comment earlier.  We moved the forward guidance out by 18 months in your chart, panel 1-I don't see anything that looks like what we did in effects.  Now you're telling me that if we pull it back by six months, we're get a much larger effect.  I'm just trying to understand how this works, how we come up MR. PLOSSER.  I just want to follow up on this particular topic.  And, Mr. Chairman, this goes back to your January.  And I look at August in terms of going to with these numbers.

Here we're talking about a full surprise.  So, first of all, the move by actually is a downward movement in response that MR. SACK. 18 months wasn't a full surprise.  There was some expectation that it was going to be longernot 18 months longer, but somewhat.  There

April 24-25, 2012

yields glass to see it. It's that little notch down in January.  But I agree with the general sentiment that, way that was interpreted and the effects it seemed to have on expectations and especially effects on volatility and the balance sheet path, you would have expected to I take that on board.  But the move did affect markets, and I think what is that it just had a lot of effect through the expected funds rate path and maybe a little you saw in financial markets.  Clearly, implied volatility responded and Treasury responded, and you can see it on the chart.  You just need a magnifying [Laughter] given the volatility, see a bigger effect.  So this says bit of effect through the term premium.

chart 18, you asked this question in the primary much the unemployment rate and the inflation rate would have to induce a change in the forward guidance.  These seem to be pretty large relative to VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes.  On dealer survey about how change to what we showed in our scenario analysis or what the SEP results suggest.  What should we draw from that distinction, if anything?

I agree that they look large.  Let me focus on the policy guidance piece.  It relative to the idea that the Committee is, say, following Taylor (1999) and or two-quarter adjustments in that date.  So essentially, ½ percentage everyone understands, would be worth 100 basis points on rate under Taylor (1999).  The slope of the futures curve out there, and the should actually be something like which seems like a very large increment relative to a reasonable increment that the market doesn't think that liftoff date is MR. SACK. certainly looks large is willing to make onepoint on the unemployment rate, as the level of the funds slope of a lot of surveys, is less than 100 basis points.  So that a four-quarter shift, for adjusting this date.  What I infer from that is simply driven by a reaction function like Taylor (1999), that they're seeing some kind of

April 24-25, 2012

reaction function.  Of course, we didn't ask about are a variety of reasons that that could be the case, such as asymmetric additional stickiness for the liftoff date in the the reasons, but there risks or commitment strategy, and so on.

It does suggest, then, that the market will be somewhat you look at those results, the central tendency for 2014 It changes so marginally relative to this.  So taking this and market would think that there was less Is that a fair inference? VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. surprised by the SEP results, because if really doesn't change at all. combining with the SEP results, presumably the stickiness.

MR. SACK.  Right-subject to the caveat that at the moment, it's very complicated how the market sees the SEP versus the statement.

However, much of the additional strength in first-quarter spendingnotably, the higher federal defense purchases and the stronger pace of inventory investment-looks likely to be transitory.  Moreover, the latest reading on personal income disappointed once again.

good deal of speculation in among macro forecasters.  First, many commentators have guessed that fall in activity in 2008 and 2009 might have distorted the warm weather during the months formerly known as probably something to both.  Let me briefly summarize our warm weather clearly pushed singleyear because builders were able to work much hand, fuels clearly was held down relative to where it would already those crack at adjusting for them in our forecast.  On balance, though, these considerations and the uncertainty that they add to the picture make us taking too much signal from the recent data. Two measurement-related issues have attracted a recent weeks the timing of the free standard algorithm used to seasonally adjust macro time series.  Second, many have noted the unprecedentedly winter and guessed that it might have boosted activity.  We've looked into both stories and think there's views as follows:  First, the distortions run in different directions in different series. For example, as we noted at the March meeting, family starts up around the turn of the more easily in ground that normally would have been frozen.  On the other consumer spending for heating have been in normal weather conditions.  Second, some of the payback has occurred.  Starts in February and March came back in line with permits-a series that historically has been much less sensitive to weather anomalies.  And part of the weakness in payrolls in March may reflect a down payment on unwinding effects.  Third, while we make no pretense of having a precise handle on these effects, we've taken a measurement especially wary of were at the time of Turning to the medium-term outlook, the changes to our usual conditioning assumptions since the March Tealbook have been so small that they do not materially affect our outlook.  Financial conditions are close to where they

Our assumptions regarding foreign activity, are also little changed from what we had assumed in Factoring all these considerations together, as shown in the upper-right panel, the previous projection, indicating that, on balance, market participants haven't seen the recent news as the dollar, and fiscal policy March. we left the trajectory of real GDP just a smidgeon stronger than before.

To be sure, the staff view that the recent recession baseline assumption is that the effective NAIRU is currently recession, point of that amount reflecting the now-diminishing NAIRU.

The middle-right panel presents one factor that informs our calibration of the research conducted by Andrew members of our staff, respectively.  This variable represents an estimate of influence on the unemployment rate of shifts in the efficiency with which workers matched to jobs-the idea being that if the matching efficiency of the labor market deteriorates, the unemployment rate might rise, but monetary policy As relatively narrow band prior to the most recent recession.  But since 2009, according to this model, the reduction in matching efficiency rate by a little more than NAIRU assumption.

Historically, our estimate of the unemployment gap has moved job availability from the Conference Board's survey of green-and at levels consistent with substantial slack For today's purposes, the important point is that we think the unemployment gap remains at about 2 percentage points-still relatively wide by historical standards.  A couple of shreds of evidence in support of that hypothesis are shown in the lower-left panel of closely with the index of households, shown in inverted form here in green-almost disappearing the index of 'jobs hard to fill' from the NFIB's survey of small businesses, shown in red.

Even with its higher deficits, Spain's ratio of public debt to GDP should remain reasonably although if Spanish banks required considerable rise.

Most of you indicated that the revisions to your your assessments of the incoming you submitted narratives that characterized the for motor vehicles-or on being at least somewhat stronger than you had anticipated in you expressed caution in extrapolating the recent concern that it might reflect temporary factors-including recent federal government or by consumers on autos, that sustained-and a couple of you also pointed to the unseasonably a possible contributor.  The Tealbook forecasts for real GDP within the corresponding central tendencies, while the Tealbook forecasts your central tendencies.  By contrast, Exhibit 4 shows the central tendency compares them shown in the top panel, the central tendency of GDP in 2012 moved up about ¼ percentage point and remains similar to the central tendency of the central tendency of somewhat, although you continue to expect real rate over that period.  As projections for the unemployment rate were the near term.  For 2014, the central tendency was it at 6.7 percent projections of real GDP and unemployment reflect data since January.  Indeed, most of incoming data on consumer spending-especially employment, or both, as January.  However, several of stronger data out of levels of spending, such as by the are not likely to be warm winter weather as growth are for the unemployment rate are at the top end of the January Tealbook forecasts were generally weaker than the central tendencies of your projections at that time.

your projections for year have moved up since January, while in rose a little.  Overall, your at levels of 2 percent or a bit less over majority of your narratives noted that the incoming readings you indicated that declines in commodity prices, sluggish wage gains, and stable Tealbook forecast has inflation a little below the lower end of your central tendencies. Moving to the bottom two panels, the central tendencies of both top-line and core PCE inflation this 2013 and 2014, the lower ends of these tendencies projections continue to show inflation running the projection period.  A on inflation had been a little higher than you anticipated in January.  However, many of inflation expectations would likely keep inflation pressures subdued over the projection period.  As was the case in January, the coming in at or your assessments of the longer-run rates of real GDP you expect the economy to converge to these years, although a couple of you expect the process may inflation. The central tendencies of growth, unemployment, and inflation-shown in the right-hand column-are unchanged since January.  Most of longer-run rates in five to six be shorter, especially for

However, likely more favorable incoming data on economic activity, somewhat fewer of elevated uncertainty than did so in January.  As shown to the right, more of the risks to your projections of GDP growth and the unemployment rate to be broadly balanced than did so in January.  Nonetheless, about half of risks to growth and upside risks to unemployment attributed to potential spillovers from the European debt crisis, including the possibility of a prolonged European recession; the impact of fiscal consolidation in the U.S.; and the possible effects of the tensions in the Middle East.  One participant noted that adverse shocks to aggregate demand could have particularly severe effects in light of the limited scope for fiscal or monetary circumstances.  Another indicated that the risk of such negative shocks balanced by the recent signs of improvement in labor markets and consumer sentiment.

Those who see from accommodative stance of monetary ability to your As shown in the bottom two panels on the left, about half of uncertainty attending high side, down slightly judge the the risks to inflation as weighted to the upside pointed to risks emanating disruptions in oil markets or from the highly policy.  With regard to the latter, some worry about the Federal Reserve's withdraw accommodation when the time comes, and the possibility of upward pressure on inflation expectations should exit prove more difficult than expected. Thank you.  That concludes our staff presentation.  We'd be happy to take questions.

all of you were very good.  Following that, consistent with our past will be an opportunity for anybody who wants to dig deeper into any of the or to raise any financial stability issues that have not been covered and our staff? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  We'll now have questions for any or all of our four presenters; practice, there financial stability issues that we should be discussing.  So let me start first with Qs and As.  Any questions for President Fisher.

I expected.  What did you say our exports are year-to-date? MR. FISHER.  Let me ask Steve Kamin-you mentioned a number on exports, which was higher than

April 24-25, 2012

I cited in my discussion was the firstannual growth rate of 6.3 percent.  That's a solid number.  It's actually well up from the exports were growing in the fourth quarter.  The firstMR. KAMIN.  Well, the exports number that quarter much lower 2¾ percent rate at which our quarter number is a little bit downward revised from what we had earlier.  And then, going forward, we're looking at growth that's in that same neighborhood.

talk about the French election.  I have a end up with a Lula who actually happens to be a MR. FISHER.  And, second, I noticed you didn't question, which is, as we saw in Brazil, isn't it possible that if we have what some people consider an adverse outcome, we might positive?  Do you have any thoughts on that?

an important consideration.  Just to fill in the Hollande, who basically was the top vote getter in those in France and contained in the fiscal pact, and, in principle, could be expected, if he were to the French commitment to its own fiscal consolidation and to the an unwelcome message; that's actually you've pointed out, we've had situations in the past where politicians who MR. KAMIN.  Well, I think it's certainly background, as is well understood, François the runoff election in France after Sarkozy, is well favored to win the regular elections that are coming down the pike.  He's been quite critical of the austerity policies, both those that are significantly water down multilateral EU-wide fiscal disciplines.  That might be understood as something that could undermine investor confidence in the region and could be very problematic.  So, clearly, the political situation in France poses additional uncertainty.  But that said, looking at the specifics, what Hollande has been apparently most focused on is the fact that one needs growth-promoting measures, in addition to just austerity, and that's hardly appropriate.  And as were seen as problematic, once they come into power, adopt more-prudent policies and actually

April 24-25, 2012

taking a are quite supportive.  So I think the situation is more uncertain, but we're definitely wait-and-see approach.

MR. FISHER.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The Federal

Reserve is officially neutral, however.

noticed that.  Can we comment on Nellie now, or do we wait?

MR. FISHER.  I

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let's wait.  Let's have the questions first.

MR. FISHER.  Okay.

Lacker. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President about inflation of misses on inflation year or so.  In December of 2010, you were forecasting 1.1 percent for overall for forecasting anyone asked to I ask you know, around the table, many of us bring very different frameworks to bear on a very smooth variable.  And as a result, the gap is quite gap has large effects on your inflation forecast, as is clear from your text. 24 and 25 of the Tealbook A.  And there it your estimate of potential output, which has been revised downward over the last several series.  You also as an alternative estimate of economic capacity, and it, too, is very smooth. you might call it, is that the natural rate responds to all of the shocks that affect MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'd like to ask the staff forecasts and economic capacity measures.  The Tealbook has had a string over the last 2011.  The latest estimate is 2.7.  And it's not just energy prices.  On core, you were 0.9 percent, and it came in at 1.8.  So I raise this with all due sympathy for forecast on a regular basis.  People like that deserve our sympathy and our support.  But because, as the relationship between inflation and capacity.  So the view-I'll call it view 1-is that the natural rate or measure of capacity is large now, and the This is illustrated very nicely in the box on pages shows years, at least the projection of it going forward, but it's still a very smooth time present NAIRU View 2,

April 24-25, 2012

at high exercise that's economic production and economic demand and ought to be expected to vary frequencies.  This is a point that's been argued forcefully by Professor Michael Woodford.  It's a point that's embodied in all of the DSGE models that we use in the DSGE conducted for periodic meetings.

I have a two-part question.  One is, on what do you rest your a priori weight you give your misses been leading you 1 in the direction of view 2? So to the smoothness of capacity measures?  And the second is, have to move at all from view view 1 if I thought that we had adhered to view 1 before.  I'm not quite sure-let me referring you to page 32 in the Tealbook A, which shows the evolution of the forecasts. you quite rightly point out, the trend in our inflation projection has been upward over the year.  I would, however, draw the contrast between the top panel and the middle GDP growth have been trending downward and the supply market.  On net, the adjustments that we've made to the supply side and, gap measure have been to potential GDP-and, broadly speaking, have as calibrated by the We put in place our NAIRU example, as I mentioned in my text, we've got the MR. WILCOX.  I guess I'd feel more compelled to express an opinion about our moving away from begin by And as last more than a panel.  The top panel shows that our estimates of over that same period.  But the unemployment rate projections shown in the middle panel have been roughly trendless.  And, in particular, for us, a pretty important date is late 2010, which is the time when we last adjusted our assumptions about the long-run NAIRU parameters of the labor in particular, to our brought that measure into line with our assessment of resource slack difference between the unemployment rate and the NAIRU. assumptions in late 2010.  Thus far, we haven't seen any evidence that compels us to move off of those assumptions.  That could emerge.  For long-run NAIRU at some point coming back down to something like its pre-crisis level.  We

April 24-25, 2012

functioning is.  We pushed it off into the reasonably distant future.  That gets under way you were going to take one measure of resource slack to the you take the difference between the you can see there, whether it's by luck-I happen colleagues, that there is a modicum of skill involved-those have been have 5¼ percent penciled in for the moment.  I don't know what the timing of that return of labor market in our projection in 2015.  If proverbial desert island, I would recommend that unemployment rate and the NAIRU.  And as to think, on behalf of my roughly trendless over that period.

to the inflation projection:  This resource utilization, or slack, I did a variance decomposition for you of inflation, it does not figure very prominently in variance decomposition some years ago that So inflation is are important in I wanted to draw that point out-for the sake of about our analytical framework and the degree to which we think resource utilization role in inflation determination.  We think it has a tremendously important role in dint of the other leg importance to all of you quite aside from its Now, the relevance of this is one critical component by which this policymaking body exerts influence over inflation.  But if inflation outcomes.  It's just simply a misconception that this is a primary determinant of inflation outcomes.  And I think Bob Tetlow did a suggested that resource utilization accounts for something in the neighborhood of 15 or 20 percent of the forward variance of inflation outcomes-something like that. difficult to forecast for sure, but this is one variable among many that determining inflation outcomes.  That's why clarity plays a Committee thinking and policymaking, partly through inflation but also by of the mandate.  So, obviously, it has tremendous role in inflation determination.

I could follow up, Mr. Chairman.  I intended to try to draw you out on you expected-over this period I citeMR. LACKER.  If the observation that in many Tealbooks, you've said

April 24-25, 2012

you your measure of was as large.  That was what I was trying to get at.  So you can be slack to be large and to hold down inflation.  Inflation wasn't held down by as much as expected, and I wondered if that led you to question the economic relevance of slack or whether slack unrepentant-that's fine.

accurate characterization.  We still think that slack is playing an important role in holding down inflation outcomes.  As that years ago and made that even flatter.  I suspect that's probably I don't have that empirical fact at my fingertips. MR. WILCOX.  That statement remains an slack is significant, roughly 2 percentage points as measured by the unemployment rate.  We still think that's playing an important role against a backdrop of stable inflation expectations.  We still think slack diminishes, we think that that's going to release some of that downward pressure on inflation.  So that has been our narrative.  It probably is the case that we have adjusted the slope of our Phillips curve from several true, although

MR. LACKER.  Thank you.

add-we, too, have a DSGE model that we follow, empirical framework.  DSGE models are an alternative approach.  I have not an alternative empirical framework that offers MR. WILCOX.  But let me just among other empirical frameworks.  At times, it's had really strikingly divergent points of view. We have a coherent seen credible evidence in real time that there is superior forecasting performance.

MR. LACKER.  Can I comment on that?

MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Just one thing-this is building on what David said.  There's the DSGE models update that was distributed to the Committee that Mike Dotsey did.

doesn't have the natural rate. MR. LACKER.  Yes.  It are four DSGE models.  They all haveMR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Well, there

April 24-25, 2012

MR. LACKER.  Yes, I know, but they don't publish the natural rate.  The natural rate is not in there in these.

can have-I assume all of them do; I know EDO doesEDO's is less than the staff's estimate of slack.  Even if you conceptual basis, it's less.  But the models have inflation forecasts, all four of mild.  I'm saying that this is just to underscore David's point, which is MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  But the inflation forecast is in all of those published DSGE projections-the median for 2014 is 1.5 percent.  The highest, Philly's, is 1.7 percent.  You're correct, but the point is that they different measures of what slack is. put it on the same them, that are very, very that there is a loose connection, shall we say, between various measures of slack and what the inflation forecast might be.

I'd point out that the DSGE models-as I understand those exercises, We take the data that we have, and then we run them out. FRB/US through current data and just running it with no adjustments.  What you you-is a combination of information gleaned from We get a mechanical projection that's devoid of any of the you provide.  So it's not quite an apples-to-apples comparison there. MR. LACKER. we run those models clean, right? You couldn't do that, I would guess, with FRB/US.  And you don't report to us forecasts that represent taking give us-and this is what we expect from various sources, including model projections, but it's a judgmental forecast.  And that's not what we get from the DSGE exercises. judgmental inputs go to President Rosengren.  Did you CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Maybe we could have a question?

I was actually going to make the same point-that the DSGE Tealbook forecast. MR. ROSENGREN. models have tended to be actually lower than the

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans, you had an interjection?

April 24-25, 2012

What I got out of Jeff's point was, there have been a lot of surprises surprised on the downside in 2009 as well.  But I'm reminded of one of contributions from the Minneapolis Fed research department several years ago where MR. EVANS.  Yes. in terms of what the inflation projections have been.  I think if we went back to earlier in this cycle, we'd say we were the strong they-I'm blanking on who did this-

Atkeson-Ohanian. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.

-Atkeson-Ohanian, who said inflation is just very difficult to forecast, always thought that it would be fascinating if we went and described a little better all of our methods for inflation determination, what as I've looked at the Tealbook forecasts, I've always I could write down, although I usually write MR. EVANS. and it tends to be a surprise.  I have around the table we bring to bear in thinking about this.  But thought that they were about as good as anything down something a little bit different.  [Laughter]

Lockhart. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President

MR. LOCKHART.  Two-hander there.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.

been a surprise.'  So I don't know if inflation has been a surprise, but all of these variables. MR. BULLARD.  Just to follow up on this-David, you might have said, 'Well, statistically there hasn't maybe not in the context of the total amount of uncertainty that surrounds know for sure.  Consistent with much of the earlier discussion Brian Sack's briefing, boy, the confidence intervals are really, really wide.  So I we've had a statistically significant deviation from prediction.  It looks to MR. WILCOX.  I don't surrounding don't know whether me as though we're up about a percentage point, and that looks to me as though that's probably going to be within any reasonable confidence error.

April 24-25, 2012

Lockhart. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President from the discussion in the Tealbook and your discussion of the fiscal 'Fiscal Cliff' scenario.  If I read correctly, the Tealbook 2013 real GDP projection could equal as much as a 1 percent reduction I right to think that the underlying strength of the economy, if you assumed 3¾ percent in 2013, which is quite a growth?  Help me understand all of that, if you would. MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Dave, again to you-I need a little help in grasping the inference drag and the is 2¾ percent, and that involves an assumption of some fiscal drag.  And then I think the 'Fiscal Cliff' discussion of an alternative scenario says it in GDP.  So am heroically that the Congress acted, would be as much as steep improvement in GDP

I mentioned yesterday at the Board briefing, we operate under spirit of what we yet sustainable, even with that substantial assumed that the 2001and 2003 tax cuts are extended With that set of assumptions, our measure of fiscal impetus, which is fiscal policy on GDP growth, has a contractionary impulse of Implicit in that is an assumption, maybe a hope-I don't know, every contractionary action to go into force that forestall in our baseline assumption is, they full effect, and they If they MR. WILCOX.  Okay.  As the tyranny of having to write something down.  But, boy, if macroeconomic forecasting is a shot in the dark, then I don't know what political forecasting is.  So, broadly, the tried to do was to get fiscal policy one step down the road toward a sustainable area.  Now, even in our baseline assumption, fiscal policy is not tightening.  That said, in the baseline, we and that the stimulus measures are allowed to expire-the payroll tax cuts and the emergency unemployment benefits. the direct effect of discretionary about 1 percentage point. perhaps a prayer-that the Congress won't allow might go into force.  And, in particular, what they prevent the automatic sequestration budget cuts to spending from taking extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, which, under current law, are scheduled to expire.

April 24-25, 2012

get themselves organized to do that, then there would be additional tax payments to the amounting to about 2 percentage points of GDP-additional, incremental, to our do by smoothing through what they are likely to perceive as, certainly, cash flow.  So we think that the additional decrement to GDP growth is und Drang about whether our political system can get its act together and in recent episodes in the past that that can have quite effects on household and business confidence.  We wanted to put this 'Fiscal Cliff' your attention.  But, gee, whether we've got the guess.  I think that probably what I'd bank my wallet on can't U.S. Treasury baseline forecast.  We've assumed that GDP growth won't slow to the full extent of that 2 percentage points of GDP, only by about half of that amount, because households, we think, will react as they usually a sudden change in their likely to be about 1 percentage point in that case.  But surrounding all of that, boy, there would sure be a lot of Sturm that sort of thing.  And we've seen significant scenario in the Tealbook to elevate it for numbers right or not is really anybody's is, I'd take a line through the numbers and just write in the words 'consequences likely to be very significant.'

MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you.

you can correct 1 percentage point, right?  And in 2012, it's about what? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  David, I heard a different question.  Maybe me.  The drag in 2013 is we haven't assumed anyfiscal drag. MR. WILCOX.  Zero, because in the 'Fiscal Cliff,' CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, but the overall

about ¼ percentage point for consolidated government at all MR. WILCOX.  Oh, it's levels.

abstract from all the fiscal influence, then estimate of GDP growth in 2012 is 2.5 plus 0.25, or 2.75, and in 2013 it's 2.8 plus 1.0, or CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Right.  So if we your

April 24-25, 2012

- I thought I heard, and maybe I misunderstood, was that, ignoring fiscal 1 full 3.8.  So I think what conditions for a minute, the underlying private sector seems to be accelerating by percentage point between 2012 and 2013.

LOCKHART.  That was my question. MR.

of the question was, what's happening CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I thought the sense in the private sector that is that powerful?

private sector is-well, this is a little bit experiment to imagine because we're going to take away a big source of you all, for example, have adopted as of monetary policy as you have.  But if we grant that, then what we're like a pretty significant, substantial step-up from what we've had, but progressing.  We think we're moving through some of the issues that you can conceive of financial conditions, remaining as accommodative as what we have in the baseline despite amount of fiscal drag, then we think that, at that point, yes, we're yet robust by anybody's description, but it has signs of progress in housing markets.  It's well available, especially to creditworthy pretty substantial improvement in the economy, I think, would ensue. MR. WILCOX.  I think what's happening in the of a difficult conceptual fiscal drag, which is probably one of the motivations why accommodative a stance seeing is, sure, 3.8 looks we think the economy is have presented substantial headwinds in the past, and if including monetary policy, the absence of that huge making progress.  Consumer sentiment is not come up.  We think we're beginning to see some early, tentative, and reversible thus far, but it's pretty eye-catching that we've had some house price increases.  We think that financial conditions otherwise are pretty accommodative, that credit outside the mortgage credit area is pretty borrowers.  And so without this additional fiscal drag of 1 percentage point, I don't know how strong it would be, but a

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President George.

April 24-25, 2012

I see that be taking on maturity risk, but for pension funds and insurance a sense of the types of risk assets they may be moving into at this stage? MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My question was for Nellie on exhibit 3, about the vulnerabilities associated with low interest rates with financial institutions. our portfolio banks may companies, do you have that we're at the front end of this work and we're Fed System.  So companies that might have some type can't alter.  Some of yet. reason is that the assets they hold are long term.  So they tend to hold lots of corporate are relatively high returns.  But their spreads are starting to compress.  So over the last earned a spread of about 1½ percent, and it's contracting down to 1 percent.  A study suggested that many of the large institutions wouldn't get really pushed for about based on asset turnover.  But we are trying to do a little work on that.  Some firms can securities lending.  That's one concern people are worried about. the aggregates aren't showing very much pickup there.  We will come back to this-it's a MS. LIANG.  I should start by saying drawing on lots of people and expertise around the System and outside the insurance companies-the key would be the life insurance of annuity product with a minimum-guaranteed kind of return that they those institutions have incentives to take on assets to produce returns.  We haven't seen a lot One bonds and lots of equities.  And those corporate bonds that they have on their balance sheets still paying 10 years, they Moody's five years add a little bit of return with But high priority.

MS. GEORGE.  Thank you.

interjections or Lockhart. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, maybe this is a good point to have any comments on financial stability.  President was just going to follow up.  I'm under the impression that the companies are quite constrained in taking on new risk by state regulation.  Most of MR. LOCKHART.  I insurance

regulated, and most of them have a pretty heavy constraint on what they can do in Is that correct? them are state terms of, at least, securities that involve more risk.

MS. LIANG.  I think that's correct, yes.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Rosengren.

all, thank you for I did find that quite usefulMR. ROSENGREN.  I had two questions on financial stability.  First of the very comprehensive, 149-page document.  [Laughter]

you ask for. MR. TARULLO.  Careful what

-and quite wide ranging.  And I also appreciate getting it a little other documents so we actually had time to read it.  So thank you for the you had in that 149-page and, I thought, was an exceptional presentation.  And a of things that I took from that-when I look at the list of the largest broker-dealers, on the list of the Moody's downgrades, by and large.  Moody's seems to be onto the a funding model that, under options we have are can't go to the discount window.  Section 23A options are more that.  If we try to think about how we mitigate broker-dealer funding problems, dealer credit facility But if facility, I was just wondering what I came up with was a larger SIFI surcharge for potentially that.  I MR. ROSENGREN. bit earlier than all of the report and the memo.  The first question relates to the very last thing report, which focused on broker-dealers couple they're also same thing that this presentation is-that the broker-dealers have duress, could be potentially troubling.  The memo also highlighted that the limited.  The dealer subs difficult, and Dodd-Frank makes 13(3) more difficult.  So the memo does a nice job of highlighting particularly should Europe worsen, one option would be to get the primary up and running again, with all of the potential political implications that that would have. we want to mitigate it more than waiting and doing a 13(3) you thought the mitigation options were.  What broker-dealers.  So if we think their funding model is different, it would be

April 24-25, 2012

exhibit 2 that there is a big difference in long-term debt.  Another option would be you would expect broker-dealers to have so that you can are obviously problems with moral hazard and other things I was just wondering, as you think about what other mitigation we can do to a your exhibit 2, do you have any other things that note in your to alter the amount of long-term debt that resolution would be easier.  And the third would be to advocate for SIFIs to get discount window access so that once you became a SIFI and were under Federal Reserve supervision, access the discount window.  There with that, but problem that was highlighted in the memo and we should think about?

gone through the key, and probably the easy, options-at least the Liquidity management-or cash and liquidity, work which is ongoingand their liquidity profiles over the past few years.  So, those options, along with we did raise was the foreign banking institutions.  That issue needs some careful thought, and that's firms, and we don't necessarily have the same over a Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. are largely counterparty and funding, another option would be to think about more centralization of derivatives would reduce some of the risks-we're moving in Work in the triparty market could help reduce risks-what you want to do is to risks in their funding models, such as in the triparty.  That would be another area to move MS. LIANG.  You've first couple, which would be higher capital, which could include a surcharge.  I think the DoddFrank enhanced standards would apply higher capital standards to Goldman and Morgan for their interconnectedness. would help.  And these institutions, as I mentioned, have really increased their capital and their cash holdings supervision, can help the two largest dealers.  One consideration that broker-dealers of a discussion that is ongoing, because, as this presentation had mentioned, many of the largest U.S. broker-dealers are subs of foreign banking holding company structure over them as we have Because their risks whether that direction. reduce

April 24-25, 2012

of areas.  I have not considered discount window access for It currently does discount window would be part of the package of being forward on.  So there are a number SIFIs.  FSOC has not yet designated any systemically important institutions. not consider that access to the considered systemically important.  That's just an entirely different line to go down.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.

I just wanted to make a very short interjection here.  I with requiring more capital or requiring more long-term debt is that it just comes gets you very far.  Obviously, the other thing you could do is, the firms could be exited their trading businesses, they'd be much smaller entities, they'd The last thing is that at least one firm that there is some question have clear access to the ratings on these firms would be higher if they growth of these very large broker-dealers, but we didn't do VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. think one issue around and then undermines profitability.  So it's not clear that pushing on those two particular levers really forced to exit their trading businesses, which are the things that really require the wholesale funding.  And so if they need much less capital, and they would need much less wholesale funding. it's feasible conceptually to find a higher-rated parent-in other words, find some way of actually being rated more highly.  In the case of about, is there a firm that could come in and actually lend them their credit rating?  And that could be significant.  But it's a very difficult problem, and you highlighted one key piece-that at the end of day, this really comes about, in part, because they don't lender-of-last-resort facility.  I think the Moody's did have an explicit access to a lender of last resort.  So that's one of the anomalies of our system, basically.  We allowed the anything to modify the lender-of-last-resort framework that we have, and so you could argue that that, at the end of the day, is really the contradiction or the tension.

Governor Tarullo. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.

April 24-25, 2012

said-Eric asked the question about the that Moody's has concluded are less likely to be saved by the United States government as will be substantially less, even though they've raised no capital and their liquidity are too big to fail and we're going to stand behind them.  So there is this paradox how governments are implementing it. MR. TARULLO.  Just to amplify what Bill options, but it's interesting to note that the option already taken by some of the continental Europeans is to reaffirm their willingness to stand behind their institutions.  So there's that irony in the fact that the downgrade considerations that Nellie was alluding to applied to the very banks a result of all of these changes.  And it now looks as though the downgrades to French and German banks positions are not as strong, precisely because the governments of those countries have basically said that they of financial reform running into asymmetries in a question?

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.

Let me just follow up a little bit more on the I come out on the whole issue of the Moody's downgrade-it's great catastrophe, because the banks do have lots of very large liquidity buffers, and the event is highly anticipated.  There will be a you think is likely to happen is different will be and how idiosyncratic it will look.  If all the firms are taken down same number of rating steps, that will be less severe to particular firms than if certain firms So that's the good news.  Nothing will probably happen really quickly. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Okay. Moody's thing.  I think where not that on the day, there's going to be any capital, they have little bit of a surprise in the sense that something that than something that actually does happen.  And there is some question about some of the firmshow big the downgrade the are taken down by more.

April 24-25, 2012

goes down; other rating agencies join in with their own downgrades, so you actually have a viable trading operation if you can't access the full customers?  So at that point, the whole trading operation's viability may be impaired, continues to head down, and the whole thing spirals on itself.  Now, I don't market environment you have a very good market environment and profitability of this activity is very high, upgraded over time. you've got a less benign environment where profitability of the whole sector is under The bad news, though, is that this could really provoke a pretty vicious circle where liquidity flows out; profitability the companies are no longer split-rated, but everybody rates some of these firms P-2; and then it really becomes a question of whether the broker-dealer trading operations are viable, because some customers will say, 'I can't do business with a broker-dealer that's rated this way.'  And then the question is, can range of and then profitability know that it has to go that way; probably in part, it will depend on what the is.  If then presumably the firms could do okay, and maybe their ratings could get But if pressure, then I think the thing would tend to culminate in an adverse way over time.

about the QS effort, Nellie, I thought it was terrific.  It was a good report, a good presentation.  You covered all the right things.  And relative to Steve's I would be a little bit more cautious or a little bit more pessimistic than what I do think it's a difference.  And I want to the fact that it's the performance of the countries' economies in a world of fiscal restraint the claims on country.  So that's a very bad adverse feedback loop that hasn't been Just generally speaking really view on Europe, you expressed.  I don't think it's a big difference, but explain why.  The important thing about Europe is that we're still very much in an adverse feedback world.  What are those adverse feedbacks?  Well, one bad loop is relationship between the that then has consequences for housing prices; that in turn has consequences for the health of the banking system; and then finally, the deterioration in the banking system increases the fiscal capacity of the

April 24-25, 2012

I can see.  Another one is the fact, of course, that the fiscal causes quite a bit of slippage between the amount you undertake and how much actual improvement that generates in your your budget balance.  And the third adverse loop that I think is really to how the Europeans have done this is that if there is official support in a package of the EFSF or from the ECB bond purchases, that effectively second adverse cautious about how this is all going to unfold.  At the end of the day, I I think we're going to go the way we have been going-that you get temporary action.  But I worry that each corrected in any meaningful way that austerity depresses economic activity, which of fiscal adjustment that outturn in terms of important with respect forthcoming subordinates the sovereign debt held by private entities, and so that makes it more difficult for the country to maintain or regain market access.  You could argue that the feedback loop is political.  The political support for more austerity lessens as this process continues.  So I'm pretty guess improvement, then things get worse, and then that provokes more time we undertake the next chapter, the political support for monetary union shrinks or gets strained, and that at some point, the political support for this starts to give way.

you can also take it as a question, and I'll allow you to comment That's a comment, but on that.

We're very much aware of all of these considerations, and we very much The question is basically, how do we factor all of these issues together as we in Europe, and it looked at that time that the situation would were taken-for IMF program for Italy-in order to really stop short this slide in investor In the event, we were surprised by how effective the LTROs were, along with the MR.

At that point, the situation was very adverse get worse, would deteriorate further until very substantial policy actions example, an expectations.

are different ways to interpret what happened.  One of the ways that we was that there were two factors that were taking place simultaneously. LTROs, when the funding situation of the banks got so much better, and and improvement in fiscal sustainability, we put a certain amount of weight on the possibility that the aspect of the problem had been more important in the previous deterioration Now, there interpret what happened One of them was this deep fiscal hole and concerns about fiscal sustainability, and the other factor interacting with that was deep weakness, both liquidity and solvency, in the banking sector.  And after the when that coincided with the substantial reduction in sovereign spreads sovereigns' banking stability than we might have judged, and therefore there might be more hope that investors weren't judging the fiscal situation to be as bad as many people possibly could have.

more recent the financial situation, and now we're left with trying to explain, well, why is that?  Now, probably just that financial markets got ahead of themselves a little bit in the first few Brian has alluded to is that a lot of the LTROs' adverse indicators that we've seen in terms of all the factors that we are confronted with now. So that's the way things transpired for a few months.  Then we've had this slide in part of it is months, and that's standard.  Another factor that takedown was being used to buy sovereign bonds, and with that having played out, there's no more support.  And then finally, there were some fiscal slippages in Spain and Italy.  So those are and place a pretty high weight on, the possibility that, basically, had anticipated.  But hard to prejudge exactly how these financial developments will go.  So for the time fairly restrained approach toward revising our outlook, where we have We are very aware of, fiscal unsustainability is indeed looming larger in investors' minds than we it's very being, we've taken a

April 24-25, 2012

of now writing down a more economic outlook for Europe.  But at the same time, we have not at this point assumed it's a little bit premature.  We have to see how these things will play we see more deterioration by forcefully. indeed taken on board the increased financial stresses in terms adverse that financial conditions will keep on getting worse and worse and worse.

So the results of this even-and this is, admittedly, a little farfetched-to provide a few more resources from an economic MR. KAMIN.  Well, that is absolutely true, both a positive and a negative sense.  Certainly from the negative sense, obviously, the fatigue that many confidence.  At the same it fiscally, and in fact, some countries that have fiscal space ought to use could be an agreement among the countries to allow those countries with more fiscal space to use it and maybe to those that don't have.  Understand, that could be a felicitous outcome standpoint, even if not so likely.

I just have one very quick question for Nellie.  Nellie, a factual CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let me turn to President Plosser MR. PLOSSER. question.  I look at memory-that looks like a little over 60 percent, right?

It's the memo of first question is about pension I remember that memo correctly, your real concern was state and local pension funds. numbers in there in terms of being underfunded. MR. FISHER.  Well, first, I want to thank Nellie for this work.  It's 148 pages because 149 is blank, by the way important for us to track this, and I wanted to thank you for that.  You also wrote March 9 about pension funds in answer to a question I had.  My funds.  If And you had some large

LIANG.  Yes. MS.

April 24-25, 2012

we are worried about fiscal drag from all sources, I wonder if a quick summary of that concern and how that might be treated.  And then I you, but let's start there. MR. FISHER.  Because you could give us have some other suggestions for

I'm going to sound like a broken record.  This is an area where we're MS. LIANG. starting again.  We just don't have as much information as we would like.

MR. FISHER.  Even though you're starting, could you give us some insight?

LIANG. The large state and local pensions, as you know, are underfunded and have been so, though, for most of the past decade.  So this is not fully, totally new.  As the closer, some of these issues are getting more prominent as the funds have I don't have all of the numbers with ratio is bringing forward projected liabilities by discounting at and by lower, depressed equity values.  So some of this underfunding will as the economy improves.  The actual drag on their current spending may not be because they're not required to close their funding gaps each year.  For example, in the sector, if they're $300 billion underfunded, I think the actual cash contribution is on very big number.  That said, there are probably some that look concern is that the funds reach for yield on investments or they just go for a else that could cause problems.  For state and can tax.  They have a taxing authority, but that raises all kinds of issues that MS. probably liabilities are coming to start paying out.  On corporate, I have here-I apologize; me-that the underfunding is about $300 billion, and on the state and local, the funding roughly the same.  But some of that's current interest rates close naturally as big corporate the order of $50 billion.  It's not a very weak.  One little bit more of a levered return or something local, in the end they sound like Europe.  But the current underfunding isn't one of those acute problems, at least not in the immediate term.

drag. MR. TARULLO.  You asked about fiscal

April 24-25, 2012

I was concerned about. MR. FISHER.  Yes, that's what how it may get pulled forward.  I thought President that you were talking about, which themselves would have a depressing MR. TARULLO.  You're asking Fisher was asking how the concerns about funding might pull forward either some of the tax policies or other policies effect on economic growth.

cash contributions or pulling forward the taxes. it varies state by state, so for some.  I guess one point, though, is that the underfunding MS. LIANG.  That's right.  It's the There are many states that have tried to implement cuts to benefits, and it's a little difficult to come up with a view on whether that is a successful strategy.  But currently it, clearly, could be a drag does not have to get covered immediately, and some of it, we think, naturally will close if the economy improves.

your asset valuation-I continue to I'm alone.  But if you look at longer-term trends-you commented in the going back two decades; some of the charts you have go back to 1985.  From an you go back pre-1968, you go back to 1990, fact, particularly given your last would be helpful, at least to me as one reader of this who reads it carefully, all 148 pages, that we have, perhaps, some longer-term time frames in terms MR. FISHER.  And then just a comment in terms of be worried, and maybe paper, basically equity market standpoint, those are not very long trends.  For example, if current S&amp;P market values are one standard deviation above the trend; if they're right on trend.  So I think we have to be mindful of that point of reaching for returns.  It very, very of asset valuation to establish the trend lines.

MS. LIANG.  Right.

we do it in deflated rather than I want to endorse the MR. FISHER.  And then, second, I would suggest nominal terms, and I'd be happy to talk to you about that separately.  But concept that this is a valuable exercise, and thank you for doing it.

agree that looking at things like the effects of CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  I low interest rates on financial institutions is very important, and that's why we're doing it. President Rosengren.

My second question is on page 64 of your big thing.  It's on the I'm an odd person to ask about farmland prices.  Unlike President anything with horns.  [Laughter]  But as I was looking at the set of charts that cropland prices have been going up, the price-to-rent ratio is dramatically at any time in the last 50 years, and the debt is mostly to banks and the Farm not do anything with interest rates in order to I might want to think about doing something with supervisory policy, particularly write-up seems to be not as worried about this set of charts, so my you to start getting worried?  And then you start getting worried, what would you do about it? MR. ROSENGREN. farmland prices.  And I know Fisher, I don't buy you had there, the higher than it was Credit System.  Now, unlike some people, I might affect that, but if we had an ability to have a capital ratio that was more focused on agricultural loans.  So it's a two-part question.  The question is, what would these charts have to look like for the follow-on is, if you might view as less of a concern relates to the amount of Farm Credit I'm always worried anymore, but, nonetheless, it is.  I think if it were larger and we thought the MS. LIANG.  I think what debt outstanding in this sector, which would be the lower part.  And including the System, there is $150 billion of this debt outstanding.  So it's fairly small. about saying that

The FDIC and the Federal were quite concerned about these loans, and they did have some interagency loss rates on it were bigger, then we privately held and distributed in complex ways, we'd be more concerned.  I believe, actually, that the supervisors did issue some guidance last Reserve-they conferences and discussed issuing guidance on this.

MR. ROSENGREN.  I think you're right, but the trend lines didn't change.

We're the economic go-round.  I have sufficient time to discuss the policy issues tomorrow.  So please keep possible.  I'll start with President Rosengren,

I, confronted with labor market data that had been stronger than expected, but spending data that Labor market data were weaker than expected, but spending data imply unemployment rate at the end of 2013 at 7.7 percent, only ½ percentage point lower than the current unemployment rate, a modest improvement over the next

After such a long growth, there should be significant pockets of pent-up demand.  Consumers cars, and they're showing some signs of life in other areas.  In some regions England, we are again seeing cranes and help-wanted signs, harbingers future that have not been present for most of the past five years.  However, my modal mean forecast.  The mean is much lower.  The modal forecast addressed; and the recent spate of articles on Spain only highlights that holding will get more difficult with time, particularly if there's not the political will to address fiscal transfers and consolidation without taking their collective economies to I am worried that a variety of end of the year.  Given the afraid that we have. I see a strange dichotomy between my modal and I growth, modest progress period of stagnant are again purchasing of the country, like New of a better forecast is not equal to my assumes that downside risks do not materialize.

Thus, risks look as though they may deliver coal in our stocking at the uncertainty in the current economic environment, it is important that we do not contribute to the uncertainty.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher.

I arrived yesterday, and I was wondering if the reception I what's happening with the was springing, we get hit with a storm, hailstorms, rain, and cold and then we wake up this morning, and everything seems to be light and better.  Or, as G. Wodehouse would say, the birds are in their trees, God is in his place, and things are almost It seems to me that from what I see in my own region and what I'm hearing from my of a setback.  But still, the pace of the economy, as it in interpreting the President Lockhart, I think, of Dave Wilcox are verified by what I'm very quickly what's happened in our District; about what I've picked up from the 34 in-depth discussions I had with of the different sectors; make a quick comment about housing MR.

Just as spring weather, P. near right. corporate interlocutors, March was a bit regards the private sector in particular, and the numbers that came forward question that was asked by hearing in the economy.  So I'd like to summarize talk in truncated form CEOs around the country in all and inflation; and then conclude.

our region, we've seen an acceleration in job and output growth year, with a slight damping of that in the March figure with the numbers Our unemployment rate has come down.  Our job growth has continued to In summary, in terms of in the first quarter of the that just came out.

And I would submit, in terms of our you subtract Texas from the United States, you'll see natural gas and the amount of petrochemical exports, which gives the and commercial real estate month.  So in the region, things are proceeding as usual, and we employment at a pace that exceeds two times that of surge.  All of the surveys we conduct Retail sales are increasing.  Exports are discussion previously on exports, that if that the U.S. numbers are significantly lower, because we have a boom taking place, in part driven by the low cost of United States an advantage because it is gas driven.  Our housing markets have improved, and our leading index that we calculate for Texas increased in February for the fifth consecutive continue to perform strongly, growing our the nation.

anecdotal soundings, again, I always preface it with 'for what it's because it's anecdotal.  But I do find some things that are indicative of stronger growth example, as you know, I like to look at the rails, and I like to look at you remove coal from rails, year to year.  With respect to truck miles, I reported last time that the truckers I speak companies in the country, are reporting in terms of the shipments that they were putting on their trucks. year over year. February were strong, March was a little bit slower, and April seems to have Regarding the dry bulk shippers, those that move things by sea, if you parse the you have to be careful in terms of what's reported-volume increases year over year.  And then from the standpoint of another indicator that I like to With regard to the worth,' than I had expected.  For trucks and those industries involved in the movement of goods.

I like to look at the MasterCard SpendingPulse data, and I want was are tracked by that survey, which I find to be come in positive for the second month in a row, and that's the first time since So there seems to be some activity that is much more positive with respect to goods and retail sales activity.  I should add that the logistics companies-there are that will remain unnamed-are reporting the best first quarter in six years, volume of shipments. With regard to the mass retailers, they seem to still be under stress, but there continues to be this bifurcation between the high-quality consumers, who are expressing robust demand; are known as the value other public support systems, who difficult middle-income markets experiencing to give our table an update through the end of March, because retail sales ex. autos, ex. gas up 6.6 percent through March.

I'm anxious to find out what the Yellen Last time, we decided not to acknowledge the fact that, get to the going to suggest that we do acknowledge some improvement, although the With regard to housing, because to take into account that the market has indeed improved.  We've seen prices on nondistressed home sales-which I think you referred to, David-tick up for two months straight.  And prices inclusive of distressed sales ticked up last month.  You mentioned the CoreLogic numbers.  The supply of existing homes on the market has trended down toward a more normal six-month pace of sales.  Inventories are home sales are up down 0.9 percent March over March.  So I would say that, while great weather has boosted housing sales above a country.  Existing home sales have picked up.

find it helpful to look at the rules.  Indeed, the potential danger of relying on forecasts of the output looking at how much the staff's forecast of the gap has changed since output gap by more than accommodation has fallen since August.  Yet, if anything, we've out.  That might be appropriate to the extent that policy was not well rules in the current Tealbook, on page 2 of Tealbook B, what is striking is that (1993) rule suggests that we are already well In thinking about the outlook for monetary policy, I prescriptions of various policy rules.  As we've discussed before, there are significant measurement issues surrounding output gaps and other measures of slack, which is one reason I am partial to growth rate gap is well illustrated by last summer.  Since August, the staff has cut its forecast for the 1 percentage point for 2011 and just shy of 1 percentage point for 2012.  The unemployment forecasts have been revised down by ½ percentage point, while inflation has been revised up by 0.3 percentage point in 2011 and 0.4 percentage point in 2012.  This means that the revisions to the output gap for 2011 alone meant that the Taylor rule-whether the 1993 version or 1999 version-prescriptions in August were understated by somewhere between 50 and 100 basis points.  These changes illustrate the dangers of relying on real-time estimates of output gaps for conducting our policies.  With estimated slack down and inflation up, this suggests that the appropriate degree of policy become more accommodative as we've added calendar dates, forward guidance, and then pushed the time of liftoff further calibrated last August.  But that was not a uniform conclusion across our policy rules in August. If we look at the the rules are becoming much more consistent in suggesting that the time for policy firming may be quite a bit sooner than 2014.  Indeed, the Taylor

April 24-25, 2012

year before the Taylor (1999) rule, which puts twice as much weight on the output ask whether that forecast is (1999) would say that the funds rate should be minus 0.5.  But if that gap shrinks by just minus 4.3 to minus 4.0, and PCE inflation is running at 2 percent, then (1999) would indicate we should be on the verge of raising rates late this year.  Using an about 7.8 percent would turn the Taylor (1999) rule into a positive number by year-end. behind the curve.  So let's ask how much improvement in the economy would have to occur by the end of this gap, would indicate that rates might need to rise, and then further reasonable.  According to the staff's current forecast, in 2012:Q4, the output gap is narrowed from 4.7 to 4.3 percent.  Core inflation will be running at 1.7 percent.  And at that point, Taylor three-tenths more, from Taylor Okun's law adjustment of 2.3, such a narrowing of the gap would suggest that an unemployment rate of

GDP growth and a 7.8 percent unemployment rate.  If that forecast is reasonable-and close to my actual forecast-then even Taylor (1999) rules would suggest we funds rate, according to that rule.  Other robust Orphanides and Williams, also suggest that rates may need to end of the year or early next year, even under the baseline scenario.  Given the as far-fetched as our forward guidance is indicating. adjustments for the LSAPs.  So I think we have that policy rules are important.  People have different policy rules, so I think our encourage us to continue those discussions. Both of those forecasts look a lot like scenario 3 in our scenario planning, with about 3 percent certainly, it's very should be very close to thinking about raising the rules, similar to those proposed by rise, likely by the degree to which the baseline forecasts have underestimated output growth, overestimated the gap, and underestimated inflation, perhaps we should recognize the possibility that raising rates late in 2012 or early 2013 may not be quite I might add that all of this is without making any to consider discussion this morning was quite helpful, and I

The unemployment rate in the District is under 'recovery' job remains well below 2007 levels, and personal income is well below a trend line that one would initiate from 2007.  Why is recovery not the same as number of business contacts over the intermeeting conversations.  First, businesses feel uncertain about the arc of about regulations, and about Europe.  Second, small and young businesses to obtain.  Third, businesses consistently mention that it is surprisingly challenging to find qualified candidates for job openings.  To me, all three of these issues have connections to another, even deeper problem that recurs in our tolerance of businesses and their funders believe this lowered

The conclusion of that follow-up work is disturbing.

As to the balance of risks, I think the risks are broadly balanced for GDP, unemployment, and inflation.  While headwinds like the problems in Europe do pose important downside risks, the recently improved news on the economy suggests that we could be underestimating the recovery's momentum.

While the staff has tweaked the forecast a little bit, the contour is basically the same.  The prediction tad stronger than theirs centennial year.

GDP growth projection, though, as that much different than the 2 percent later this year and to around year after, and it explicitly attributes this to the projected low level My sense is that the forecast misses have reflected an overly great a priori weight on year and I don't think of my Tealbook's.  The inflation projection is another story, however, and we discussed this a little bit earlier.  The Tealbook has inflation falling below 1½ percent next year and the of resource utilization that will help hold the average pace of inflation below the Committee's objective. the smoothness of the natural rate.  In my submission, I penciled in 2.0 percent for this next year.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Lockhart. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President and contacts in the Sixth District about three concerns.  First, we asked about their growth prospects based on their most recent readings of the economy.  Specifically, we augur a mid-year swoon similar to that experienced in 2010 asked about their reading of employer thinking regarding ongoing and at the question of how to reconcile the rate of job creation before with the apparent strength of the economy.  More specifically, we asked MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In preparing for this meeting, we asked our directors sense of asked if there were indications of acceleration given the recent stronger-than-expected numbers, or, alternatively, slowing that may and 2011.  Second, we future hiring.  We tried to get the March payroll report if the catch-up explanation rang true.  And, third, we asked about their views on price pressures, specifically their sense of pricing power broadly among their contacts and intentions to raise prices.

We heard little that Regarding economic growth, our business contacts generally see no basis for predicting either market acceleration or a slowdown.  The majority of our directors remain firm in the view that activity will continue to grow near the pace of the past six months.

Auto sales remain strong, as others have noted, and our contacts at for the Interestingly, one contact who represents the largest auto retailer in the argued that high gasoline prices are actually encouraging sales as consumers unload old a home-improvement retailer the current quarter.  As regards business investment spending, we heard gains and cost savings or, in some would suggest a pullback in consumer spending.  The expectation is for continued modest growth of consumer various points in the chain are pretty uniform in their belief that sales will remain strong foreseeable future. country cars for much more efficient new models.  A director representing with national coverage supported the view that mild weather had brought forward some sales and expects some payback in that capital investments continue to be aimed at productivity cases, share capture.  Investment for actual business expansion remains considerably more subdued.

employment picture, the idea that recent job gains related to firms catching up from prior deep cuts was supported by many of our contacts.  Most saw about shortages of qualified applicants for available jobs.  We asked about wage Turning to the restaffing or the mindset of businesses as quite cautious about ongoing and future hiring.  We also continue to hear anecdotes pressures in light of reported shortages of qualified applicants and detected little evidence of this.

A few firms indicated but most doubted their pricing power in the current economic environment. lot of concern about near-term inflationary pressures.  We did detect some heightened concern about longer-term inflation risks in our survey work.  In synthesizing all of the data and anecdotes, I have not made any material changes to my outlook since the March

April 24-25, 2012

tracking estimates have been coming in a little above our earlier first quarter in our full-year estimate of GDP growth forecast hasn't really changed much, and it is relatively close to and is very similar to the Tealbook baseline.  Regarding the balance of risks to GDP Because the first-quarter assumptions, we took on board a slightly stronger growth.  But my 3 percent growth and inflation, I have adjusted my views slightly and now see the risks reasonably balanced for both.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Third, as I mentioned at the last meeting, with the data.  January and February were very mild, but year together were the warmest for any year on record.  As I mentioned while this undoubtedly depressed the consumption of housing-related energy of activities, such as construction, production, I think it is going to take a few months effects were. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My views of economy haven't changed much since the noted, activity for Q1 seems slightly firmer, but have seen these types of of sustained, vigorous expansion.  And, second, the downside risks to the outlook don't appear to have diminished.  In fact, the European outlook appears to have deteriorated again as the temporary euphoria of the ECB the weather may be playing some tricks March was even milder, relative to the seasonal trends, than January and February.  In fact, the first three months of the at the last meeting, services, it probably raised many other categories as well as hiring.  We have done some analysis that looks at warm weather events, and it does tend to boost economic activity, with a lot of variability. to assess how important these weather

April 24-25, 2012

I took the improvement in the economy at face value in Q1, it we should do in terms of monetary policy is better, but by how own expectations.  I was expecting the economy to do somewhat better year.  When I look at the economy's performance, it exceeds my expectations only More importantly, even if wouldn't have much impact on my views on what going forward for three reasons.  First, what matters is not that the economy much it is better than my this marginally.

not whether the economy is better now, but how much this will be in 2013 and 2014.  I thought the SEP exercise was interesting in that going to end up in way for the years.  The improvement in the economy is very small relative to the uncertainty about Second, what matters is affects where we regard because it really didn't change where people think we are actually 2014.  I don't think what we have seen changes the outlook at all in any meaningful next few the longer-term outlook.

third point I would make is that in the current circumstances, it is very important If we tighten prematurely and push the economy surprises me on the upside, I am going to be I noted, the growth in China, and the U.S. fiscal cliff is really quite important in terms of year. And the to stress that the risk of policy errors is not symmetric. economy into a ditch-get stuck in a debt-deflation trap-that would be far worse than a stronger economy than we expect.  If the delighted by that, and I know how to respond to that.  In addition, I would underscore that while the economy has improved a bit, the downside risks to the economy have not.  As European situation has taken a turn for the worse.  We have some uncertainty about the sustainability of thinking about the outlook this good way rather than a bad way, there is going to be a lot of When we talk to business people, they say that-as President Evans noted-even if the fiscal cliff does get resolved in a

A lot of business people think chill on investment and hiring in the second half of the year relative to year. uncertainty in the run-up to that as we that this really will put a the first half of the growth.  We do In fact, it would be better if it was an even stronger am a little bit perplexed by whenever this happens, then we turn around and exit.  In this regard, I how a lot of people use the Taylor rule as a guide to policy.  As I said to me a headache.  He promised to give me a I said that.  [Laughter] I also think it is important that we don't overreact to 3 percent real GDP want acceleration in the growth pace. acceleration, so I conclude that policy must be too easy and we need to start thinking about am very skeptical about Governor Tarullo yesterday, the Taylor rule gives dollar if

want to talk a little bit about the Taylor rule, because the Taylor rule is fine as a you use it properly, but I think we use it way too mechanically.  There is rule really works in an environment where we are very experience.  The thing that particularly bothers me about the Taylor rule negative real rates we am sure we would be growing quite a bit faster than 3 percent.  I take a real signal forward momentum of the economy in terms of revising my views about what equilibrium real rate were easier than the Taylor rule implies because the errors on one side are considerably higher than on the other. I benchmark of policy if a real question about whether the Taylor far away from historical is, who would want to use it with the equilibrium real rate of 2¼ percent as part of their rule, as the Tealbook does?  I don't think there is any evidence that the equilibrium real rate is anywhere close to 2¼ percent today, because if it were-and given the very sharply have today-I from the lack of the equilibrium real rate in the economy is.  And, of course, even if the 2¼ percent, I would argue that policy should be cost of policy

admit that there has been a little bit of stickiness, a little uptick On inflation, we have to in both headline and core inflation.  The headline inflation uptick doesn't really bother me too much because it looks like it is oil and gasoline prices.  And if you look at the futures market, it suggests that those prices should come off.

The core could be potentially more bothersome, depending on how persistent this was going to be.  But it looks like it is persistence. many months, but cotton prices, in particular, have come off quite sharply.  Talking to a major retailer that sits on our price pressures moderate once we

While we are seeing higher inflation, does that tell us that the output gap has diminished a lot and we have a lot to worry about? gap is supposedly narrowing, then it should show up in terms of increased compensation cost pressures for labor, and we see no uptrend whatsoever in any measure of The employment cost index is flat, and average hourly earnings has been flat to trending downward over the past the labor compensation costs?

The unemployment rate stands well above my I information we have received over the latest intermeeting period, as well as over the three-month interval since our previous SEP.

Readings on points to a pickup in demand for consumer credit, as well as further easing loans.  Most notably, the off or even edging up as good news, but it is essential to keep things in perspective.  After all, the U.S. economy is still recovering from the steepest and most prolonged downturn since the 1930s.  Even with the last few months of job gains, we are still far short of where we need to be.  Private payrolls remain nearly estimate of its longer-run normal level.  And even with a highly accommodative monetary

With that experience in mind, I cautious in my remarks last April.  But even at that meeting, I referred to 'heartening signs of improvement in the labor market.'  And, again, it was only a double-dip recession reemerged.  Thus, I sincerely hope that over the course of this spring can be firmly resolved to avoid yet reasons to hold off on assessment of the modal outlook.  For example, in the I spent quite a bit of time looking at the Zillow you may already be familiar with Zillow's capability of real-time estimate of the current market value of your home, and, in fact, of country.  But you may not have realized that that have attention in recent years.  In particular, Zillow's hedonic methodology Indeed, in sifting through the recent data, I have seen compelling any marked upward revision to my process of settling our family's housing situation, website, which is chock-full of valuable information regarding developments and prospects for the housing market.

At the national level, the Zillow about 2 percent over the first three months of this year, Zillow price index shows tentative yet point to a broad-based turnaround in the housing market.  It Zillow conducts a quarterly survey of about 100 housing analysts, few weeks ago, the consensus outlook was for U.S. house prices year.  The headline for those results was, In gauging recent developments, both Zillow and CoreLogic point to the stabilization of house prices in certain localities, such as there are many other cities and regions where deterioration, including index declined at an annual rate of roughly half the pace of its decline during 2011.

I agree with you that we need to look at these data I wouldn't rely on any single database to give us a full indication. MR. FISHER.  Yes.  The objective, it seems to me, is to try to determine things.  One is purchasing power, obviously, and how it affects consumption.

There is a real prospect of structural damage.  Here I agree with what Narayana has been looking at for some time be facing is very unlikely to be a mismatch story.  If mismatch, you're not finding them right now in the data that we're seeing.  One of the investment banks had a very nice little report on the experience of construction workers.  You'd think that if there's one but, in fact, the percentage of construction workers who have been in long-term unemployment is declining faster than rapidly than for the population as a whole.  It's interesting-their wages in the new jobs are substantially lower than in their old jobs, but they rate than in the economy going to have to be in the very young college students who used to have part-time jobs can't get them you think about it, if you are a college student working, you're in the labor force and you're a college student you're now out of the giving a slightly misleading indication of what's been going on Decline in the labor participation rate is something that obviously is pored over, but one source of the actual decline, and John alluded to this, is cohort of people of 16 to 24.  That appears to have been largely, although not completely, explained by the fact that many now.  As you have a job.  You're in both the numerator and the denominator.  If who is not working anymore, you're not counted as unemployed, and yet labor force, and that may well be at that end of the labor market.

an insufficiently quick rebound in aggregate demand to get back into jobs all the a result of mismatches, which would defy any All in all, then, if there is a risk of structural damage, it still appears to me as though it's the result of people who lost them along the way, and not as effort to create jobs through increased demand.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Let's call them, one, real disposable income is flat; two, new jobs five, fiscal policy is becoming increasingly restrictive. MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  While positively, my projections remain mostly unchanged due to a continued concern about more than a modest strength and durability to our recovery.  I'll focus my remarks on consumer spending as one relevant prism. regarding are low wage; three, student debt can crowd out spending; four, this is a presidential election year; and, the weakness in real disposable income.  Of all the factors and, anemic in the first Real wages, in particular, have remained flat for some time.  Unless income growth households start to take on excessive amounts of debt again, I believe The first factor relates to driving growth in consumption, the factor with the greatest effect is real disposable income. However, Americans' disposable income has been rising at a subpar pace in recent quarters given recent price increases at the gas pump, appears to have been especially quarter. steps up considerably or American households have insufficient means to propel faster consumption growth.

consumer spending relates to the fact clerks, food prep workers, and stock clerks-grew by 3.2 percent from the The second factor influencing my concern about that the job growth that has occurred has been concentrated in very low-wage occupations. According to the National Employment Law Project, lower-wage occupations-retail salespersons, office

declined 1.2 percent.  This may suggest that across the distribution are taking less-lucrative positions.  They're taking whatever jobs can get.  This is a form of underemployment that isn't captured by the latest employment growth.  Unfortunately, this may soon.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that five of the top six first quarter of 2010 through the first quarter of 2011, while mid-wage occupations rose just 1.2 percent, and higher-wage occupations actually workers they data, but will likely continue to contribute to the subpar income not turn around any time occupations with the most job growth from 2010 to 2020 will be low-wage jobs.

Structural forces, such as rapidly rising tuition and an increasing graduates entering post-secondary education, are the main culprits, though lack of good job market prospects, are likely also important.  Increased crowd out spending on cars, houses, or years.  This could affect not only today's youth, but also today's adults. cohort feel pressured to take out loans to help with their children's education Third, I'm concerned that high levels of student debt coupled with a poor labor market for post-college entry-level jobs may impede grown rapidly in recent share of high school cyclical forces, such as a levels of education-related debt incurred in youth may other items in later Many of my expenses, and are themselves now helping make payments on student loans.

yesterday, and then I will add a few comments. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good morning, everybody.  Let me start off this morning with a summary of the discussion from general agreement that moderate economic growth was continuing.  Some strength and expressing increased confidence recovery, while others were less sure, citing factors like the confounding and noting that we had had false dawns each of the past two years.  In case, important downside risks remain, including the European situation and the fiscal cliff, to impede growth even if the worst outcomes were not realized, the There was participants were more optimistic, noting signs of in the durability of the influence of the weather any both of which were likely geopolitics of oil, and perhaps a slowdown in Asia.

with pent-up demand, could be a reason for strong a number of headwinds, Labor markets are generally year so far than they were last year, with regional variation.  Highly qualified of the decline in participation may be cyclical, reflecting, as it does, younger workers.  If so, unemployment will decline more slowly in the future as the are attracted back to the labor force.  There was a discussion of adducing evidence from areas such as the Stockholm In the household sector, consumer spending continues to expand, notwithstanding high gas prices.  Indeed, high gas prices, along auto sales.  However, further speed-up in consumer spending faces including weak growth in disposal income and wages, student debt burdens, the effects of political campaigns on confidence, and restrictive fiscal policies.  It was noted that affluent consumers are increasing spending more than the less affluent. stronger this workers remain in short supply, but wage pressures overall are limited.  Understanding the apparent breakdown in Okun's law and the decline in participation are important for predicting unemployment.  About half primarily economy improves and workers the extent of structural unemployment,

Housing has shown some signs of improvement on a variety of dimensions, although weather may be a factor though not gaining traction, which will help housing activity gas is capital investment is aimed at productivity gains and investment later this year.

The ECB's LTROs stabilized markets for a economic growth in Europe remain significant, and markets Even if a full-blown crisis in Europe is avoided, the situation is likely to drag on to the detriment of U.S. economic growth.

and market close to where we were in March.  Recall that the March closed before the labor market report on the Friday before the meeting, but example, that the April Blue Chip survey was essentially S&amp;P 500 and Treasury yields, which are both indicators of the outlook, were in March.  And policy expectations are unchanged or A first observation is that, notwithstanding some swings in the data sentiment, overall we are pretty Tealbook was meeting to meeting we can say, for identical to March.  The are essentially identical to where they may be slightly more to the expansionary side.  So there is not much indication of a significant overall net change in view since our last meeting.

I talked about in my speech at the NABE Conference, I think the element of the outlook.  To the extent that the recent a one-time catch up offsetting the unusual pace of firing GDP growth remains moderate and close to trend.  This is basically the story in the growth will pick up, and it will be a self-reinforcing recovery between Going forward, as Okun's law puzzle remains a very key improvements in the labor market were in 2008 and 2009, then it may be the case that further improvements will be hard to come by, particularly if Tealbook and in a majority, if not all, of the SEP projections.  Of course, there is the alternative possibility that GDP growth and employment.

April 24-25, 2012

I really don't put much weight in the data There are plenty of special stories to explain the March labor some factors that we again, I don't think we great deal since March, and that puzzle still remains central to our outlook going economic growth-slow I think it was President Rosengren who said that the output data were stronger and the labor market data were weaker than we had anticipated, and in some sense that is kind of splitting the difference between the two stories.  But we received since the last meeting. report and UI claims.  Again, weather is an issue certainly.  And on the GDP/GDI side, GDP, for example, was stronger in the past couple of quarters, but there were certainly were likely to be temporary, such as inventory buildups and a surprising increase in defense spending, whereas the GDI number, which was very impressive in the fourth quarter, was almost entirely in profits rather than in wages.  And so that is already included, in some sense, when look at stock price effects and equity values on consumer spending.  Once have learned a forward.  We certainly hope for the strengthening expansion story, but it still seems to me that if I have to choose at this point I would still stick with the moderate improvement in the labor market scenario.

was at a 0.3 percent rate in the first quarter.  Wealth overall it is hard to see where a substantial improvement in consumer going to come from.  With respect to other components of aggregate demand, trade growth.  We all know the story of fiscal policy, which but is a very small part of aggregate demand. As Governor Raskin and others pointed out, for consumer spending, while improving, there doesn't seem to be the fuel needed to accelerate.  Disposable income growth 0.8 percent in all of 2011 and is estimated to be effects may help some, but spending is looks to be roughly neutral for economic is not going to help.  Housing is improving slowly And nonresidential investment will react to broader demand conditions.

April 24-25, 2012

and the next meeting we will be seeing two labor market reports and the GDP is at the end of this week.  So, again, in terms of the modal outlook, my best growth with slow improvement in unemployment, similar There is a lot to be learned from observing the data that are incoming, and I note that between now number, which estimate right now is still for moderate to our March statement.  I do note that downside risks and uncertainty remain important, as many people have discussed.

Yellen mentioned, we and several others attended various components of meetings over the weekend, and on the whole, they were not particularly to bunds are both up system, given the and other types of credit.  In actions that have been taken, the firewall that was put together on the whole has the various options that were proposed, and it IMF announced $420 billion of additional resources, but the BRICs IMF are insisting on tough conditionality, as accept programs and concerns about either subordination or default with respect to their own As Governor the G-7, G-20, and IMF encouraging in terms of the European outlook.  Italian and Spanish spreads about 90 basis points since the March meeting despite apparent progress in their fiscal programs. Spain, in particular, has a very large and uncertain obligation to its banking declining real estate prices and the risks they pose for mortgages terms of policy to be judged disappointing.  It was the smallest of became clear in discussions in the meetings over the weekend that even Europeans view the firewall as being very unwieldy in its construction, very difficult to use in practice, and not flexible in its design.  The that were making the major commitments to the they should.  But that will of course increase the reluctance of countries to will increase lenders' debt.  And the political considerations have been noted.  The French election and the Dutch government collapse are indications that the German-led consensus is starting to unravel.

[Laughter]  So I think we A lot was also said about the fiscal risks, which even in the best instance will create a lot of uncertainty near the end of the year.  The fiscal problem.  But a third issue is the fact that the one-year budget September, and there will be a fight over election, do face, on the whole, downside risks and uncertainties that should lead us to be cautious.

it is very close to 2 percent, and it does seem to be well anchored overall.  As I noted in a gasoline story.  For example, the latest CPI readings, ex and fuel oil but including all other energy and including all food, was an inflation rate past three months of 1.79 and for the past six months of 1.71.  So it is very much gasoline come down a little bit over the intermeeting period, are suggesting some meaningful softening in prices after the peak of the I talked about non-energy commodities, mostly metals and agricultural commodities.  This index rose year, and it is If I had to pick a single factor that accounts for the would say that commodity price pressures do ultimately find their way are enough to account for differences of several tenths in core price with a stronger dollar and weaker non-fuel import prices, makes me feel On the inflation side, it is true that inflation has been a little higher than expected; however previous meetings, this really is mostly gasoline for the that is driving a lot of this.  Breakevens have and gasoline futures driving season in the next month or so.  More broadly, last time commodities.

The first paragraph of alternative B updates the March language to reflect the recent data, including (implicitly) the less positive tone of the March payroll employment report and the tentative signs of improvement in the housing sector.  In addition, the statement acknowledges the recent increase in inflation resulting from the jump in crude oil and gasoline prices earlier this greater clarity about the link between the Committee's alternative B includes new language about the Committee's policy.'  In light of the deterioration of the situation in In an effort to provide economic outlook and its forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate, the second paragraph under medium-term outlook for real activity and the stance of monetary policy on which that outlook is conditioned, stating that it expects economic growth 'to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up gradually, supported by highly accommodative monetary Europe, the statement drops the reference to an easing of strains in global financial markets, while continuing to say that those strains pose significant downside risks. The statement indicates that the earlier increase in oil and gas prices is expected to

boost inflation only temporarily, with inflation expected subsequently to run at or below mandate-consistent levels.

reiterates that the Committee anticipates that economic conditions low levels for the federal funds rate 'at least through late retention of this forward guidance as appropriate for a that the rule your SEP projections (assuming an yields a funds rate prescription of less than 50 basis Paragraph 3 will warrant exceptionally 2014.'  You may see the number of reasons.  First, the optimal control exercises under commitment staff includes in the Tealbook suggest that the funds rate should remain at its current level until mid-2015.  Alternatively, the application of a standard Taylor (1999) to the midpoint of the central tendencies of Okun's law coefficient of 2.3) points at the end of 2014-consistent with an expectation that liftoff will take place late in that year.

Given these concerns, you may feel that retaining the existing forward guidance is appropriate, at least for now.

B, the final paragraph of the statement would be unchanged.  A alternative B would be consistent with market Under alternative statement along the lines of expectations and so would likely have little effect on interest rates, stock prices, or the foreign exchange value of the dollar.

This change is not intended to provide additional accommodation, but rather is an option that public understanding regarding the link between economic conditions and the Committee's policy decisions.

I think the people in answer to that.  I am not so sure that people go with that, if in the optimal control exercise is the fact that the though it is tempted to raise rates to fight inflation.

It is certainly the case, the way you describe it, that a policymaker is going to make this choice and then later is going to be tempted to make a different 19 99.  We just put that on the table, and we don't describe whether or I wanted to get worked up about something like (1999) plus two meetings fine rule.  It all comes down to the public basically are in this for quite some time relative to how we look at this.  I don't see a lot MR. EVANS. optimizing choice.  We somehow, though, are willing to be totally agnostic about something like a Taylor rule, whether it be 1993 or not the policymaker would want to deviate.  If this, I could propose something like, what if we looked at Taylor beyond that?  That is a perfectly understanding we of value added beyond that.

I might, Mr. Chairman.  All I was trying to suggest is I think the public is confused about whether or not the Fed is keeping rates low because it going to be bad over this stretch, or it is keeping rates low because it is MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, if that thinks the economy is

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Tarullo.

you, Mr. Chairman.  Bill, the April 17 staff memo provides a maturity extension the the MEP.  I wondered whether you or Brian or both had MR. TARULLO.  Thank very useful background for the paragraph 3.1 proposal in alternative A for program.  One thing that wasn't addressed in that memo was the potential impact of Treasury's debt management policies.  And I ask about that because, although I think we all realize the direction in which those policies affected our maturity extension program, I have been surprised by a couple of recent papers about the possible magnitude of the impact of the Treasury maturity extension on the efficacy of

April 24-25, 2012

the Treasury's current debt management plans would offset the efficacy A. any perspective on how of the proposal in 3.1 of in talking about 'offsetting.'  I think the there is that the Treasury has a plan; it is going to do whatever it is going to do.  As long as what this Committee does is whatever it is.  That's what we have MR. ENGLISH.  You have to be a little careful issue it doesn't change that plan in response to your decision to do an MEP or not to do an MEP, then the marginal effect of calculated in the memo.

the Treasury suggest that is not true, and that it has a plan-it has had it for its outstandings.  It is implementing that plan. it does because of what the That would suggest that the effects of implementing a new MEP are exactly The question is, is there feedback?  As the Committee engages, say, in a new extended MEP, and that makes long rates lower than they would otherwise be, does the Treasury shift its issuance into those longer maturities in order to take advantage of those lower rates?  Our interactions with some time-to extend the average maturity of That plan is understood in the market, and there is no change to what Committee does. what we described in the memo.  Brian, do you have any further thoughts?

agree.  The Treasury's debt management decisions have average maturity of the debt, but not in response to our programs or to rate notes, MR. SACK.  No.  I completely been lengthening the yields.  In fact, the major debt innovation that is on the table today is to issue floating which goes in exactly the other direction by putting less duration into the market.

Regardless of what the preexisting plan was, it presumably had a nonMR. TARULLO. trivial, and by some measures quite significant, effect in that the simultaneous extension of maturity of Treasury debt with our programs did offset one another to some degree, not perhaps in a responsive sense but in a market sense, right?

the Treasury continues with its program of extending the average then that is going to push up longer-term rates a little bit because it is pricing of assets your action and provide additional accommodation by pushing against that MR. ENGLISH.  But the way to think about it is if the Committee, say, decided to not do an extension of the MEP, and maturity of their debt, going to change the distribution of outstanding debt.  That is built into the today.  You can take or not.

This policy judgment reflects the fact that gradual progress in meeting that I anticipate that, under our current forward guidance, inflation will remain near or entire forecast horizon.  Considerable uncertainty attaches to both my at the end of 2014.  My (1999), a policy benchmark useful, especially in normal times.  But Taylor (1999) is not the only relevant the zero lower bound, are these normal times. Given that my quite comfortable with our current policy we are far from full employment.  My outlook is for only objective, and below 2 percent over the unemployment and inflation forecasts.  Even taking such uncertainty into account, I see the odds as very high that unemployment will exceed its normal longer-run rate preferred liftoff date is later than would be consistent with Taylor that I consider benchmark, nor, given that we are constrained by

I Committee's the loss function embodied in the simulation welfare detracting, a view that is inconsistent result in a significant miss on My views for the funds rate to remain near zero until late 2015.  I described in the Tealbook highly attractive.  Inflation remains close to 2 percent forecast period, peaking under Taylor President Kocherlakota pointed out, that the optimal control strategy requires commitment, and it is questionable whether this Committee can or should commit its successors they have chosen that a later Committee would consider undesirable when Moreover, such promises might lack credibility.  In this regard, however, it is worth noting that the main reason for regret in the staff optimal control simulation stems from the fact that along the optimal control path unemployment undershoots NAIRU don't think the regret reflects any significant or persistent overshoot of the 2 percent inflation objective.  The problem is that treats an undershoot of the unemployment goal as with many theoretical models of an economy dominated by monopolistically competitive firms. In my personal view, such outcomes are mainly undesirable if they our inflation objective, something that is not the case along the Tealbook baseline optimal control policy path.

my mind, optimal monetary policy must also take into account the constraints that and Williams have shown that an effective strategy to rate lower for longer than would otherwise be the case.  I find this logic To have long been imposed on policy by the zero bound, a unique feature of the environment that makes it non-normal.

Should those risks materialize, we guidance.  Meanwhile, downside risk to the forecast remains significant.  My own view financial market strains relating the year-end approaches, another debt ceiling with the possible fiscal train wreck.  Should such downside risks response. My preference for such a path is also motivated by course, risks that economic growth will prove more robust than in the Tealbook baseline, and inflation could accordingly come in higher.  Given the substantial headwinds to economic growth that have adequate room to respond, and I would certainly be willing to do so by shortening the forward is that the risks remain asymmetric.  The potential for renewed to European developments is very real, and as deadline looms along materialize, the zero lower bound will impose significant impediments to an adequate

I also consider it prudent gun in responding to incoming data, and as I Committee will have avoid the market disruption that would result from I have argued that it is appropriate to leave policy to do so.  We should be careful not to jump the noted in my economic statement, this is the third April in a row where the upgraded its outlook.

Our policy confident that the outlook, or the risks prematurely would surprise the markets and additional monetary context of price initiating another round of the maturity I believe it is also important for us to remain prepared to provide accommodation as warranted to foster a stronger economic recovery in the stability.  Indeed, if incoming information points to a weakening of the outlook or a widening of downside risks, I would see a very strong case for extension program, conceivably involving purchases of some combination of mortgage-backed securities and longer-term Treasuries.

MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Given the recent data, my current anticipation is that conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low interest rates through

April 24-25, 2012

Economic Projections indicates some funds rate, but one can debate the magnitude of that mid-2013, and that we would raise rates then.  Obviously, the majority of the Committee at the past two meetings has favored instead the view that conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low interest rates through late 2014.  The Summary of movement in views about the course of the movement.

at which we launch or liftoff, as it was clear at the previous meeting that we have some work to do to understand we manage this language.  It presents some difficulties like to spend a little bit of time talking about. going to argue that we should not hesitate, if our forecast changes, to change the forwardrather than later.  The Tealbook I read it, to rise in the first quarter of 2014.  In January they were the fourth quarter of 2014.  The SEP has shifted.  It's not obvious from the dot picture case that the median has perhaps Independent of our views about the particular date were, I think it and come to terms with the conditions under which we would alter our calendar-based forwardguidance language; in other words, how in how we're thinking about this.  That's what I'd I'm guidance language, and I think this could be pressing sooner now expects the funds rate, as expecting just when in 2014 people expect the rise, and you could make a shifted from late to mid-year.

because it conveys a sense of spurious precision.  After all, when we're away don't adjust the federal funds target by 5 or 10 basis points, although increments at a accelerating by leaps and bounds.  But that aside, we generally wait changes.  By the same token, Now, I can understand the argument for not engaging in too much fine tuning of the forward guidance from the zero bound, we there was this unfortunate episode in the late 1970s when we used one-eighth time when inflation was until 25 basis points is what we think the funds rate should change by and change it by 25 basis points.  That's essentially become our minimum tick size for policy

That would keep us on the sidelines too long and would make the changes, shall we say, interesting in financial markets, right? volatility, it's fair to say. sure and then changing interest rates 100 basis points.  What we need to figure out is our minimum tick size for calendar-based forward

'mid-2013,' and we've used the term 'late 2014,' and that seems to one-third of the year, a trimester, four months.  The calendar-based early, mid, or late whatever year you're talking about.  The critical question forecast changes by one-third of a year, shouldn't we change the forwardI think the obvious answer is that we should, when the projection of the changes, the workable consensus of the Committee members, voting you want to think about the decision process. We've used the term imply that the tick size is guidance is either becomes if our guidance language? median Committee member Committee members, participants-however

When that forecast is shifted by four months, we change the forward-guidance language.

But that does bolster the case that equivalent size of the gets you in the right ballpark. I'll mention, by the way, there was which reported on attempts to measure the federal funds rate change equivalent of a onetrimester change in our forward-guidance language, and the answer was 75 basis points.  Now, that suggests that the appropriate tick size is a ninth of a weeks that is, but increments of in terms of our traditional metrics, at least one attempt to quantify the policy change leads to an answer that

April 24-25, 2012

at least one-third of the year because it would represent the first tightening move-this previous meeting-and markets would immediately price in a very rapid argument, and that doesn't make sense.  We should be so that perhaps the first inward adjustment is change than they would to the first one.  The we hold on to late 2014 and then the larger the adjustment we would make when the time good reasons; we make smaller increment adjustments. There might be a reluctance to move the forward-guidance date even if the forecast has moved by language came up at the exit.  I don't think that's a persuasive thinking in terms of several small adjustments going to be a big deal, but over time markets come to anticipate that these things move in and out, and over time they'll respond less to any one longer comes, say, to late 2013 or to early 2014 rather than mid-2014, then the larger the reaction will be.  That's analogous to waiting until we want to make a 75 or 100 basis point move.  We don't do that for gives rise to a sequence of interest rate increases, and so that might be a reason that we should language as maybe more breaks down because a forecast is a If you change your forecast, if you expect that all the subsequent changes in the going to be in one direction, then it's not your forecast.  If you change to mid-2014, you believe that it's much more likely to change to early 2014, late 2013, then that's not a It's not really accurate, right?  It ought to be if you're risk, that's forecast.  It's the middle of the distribution of potential dates.  I don't think this arguing here for this general You might argue that the first move of interest rates in a tightening cycle expectations of think about our first inward movement of the forward-guidance consequential than you might think.  But that analogy forecast, right? forecast are and forecast, that's a biased forecast. forecasting late 2014 that it's equally likely to be sooner or later.

It's hard to tell.  We don't ask about it in the SEP, guidance in the statement, it strikes me that it would be in this calendar guidance, to which trimester do you believe the takeoff is in?  Now we just ask about the year, and you a takeoff then.  There are three at 50-that's probably indicating that they a bit?  You don't really know what's I'd advocate that as we go around today, we each report which trimester we That would help our deliberations. The threshold question then is:  Has the forecast changed from late 2014 to mid-2014? And, frankly, under our current procedures, it's really hard to tell.  If Economic Projections, a the ones in the middle have gone up, I and given our use of calendar language useful to make that a part of the SEP disclosure, since we're putting ask get the year-end number.  You could look at the dots and say, well, the ones that are on the floor for sure, they don't see didn't raise rates until the last trimester.  But what about the ones at 1 percent?

I said, mid-2013 is when I expect the liftoff.  I'm clearly not the median. I've discussed before.  When the real output and employment pick up, we'll need to increase rates to prevent a rise a dramatic rise in inflation-that should be credibility for a commitment to 2 percent inflation is relatively high.  We deserve years than we get in popular until that credibility noticeably erodes is setting we've won is just too stringent a For my part, as I'll dissent if the statement isn't close to that for reasons that growth rates of in inflation.  We should be thinking of preempting our goal.  Our more credit for keeping inflation steady over the past couple of coverage of us, but to me that means that waiting too high a bar for policy.  Waiting until we lose the credibility

April 24-25, 2012

is that we'll need to do that next year.  This is all predicated on the standard.  And my sense continuing use of the calendar-based language.

admire President Plosser's suggestion for a kind of a traverse away from the calendar the language that Bill English described at the end of A and the end of them in parallel for a couple of meetings and then the calendar guidance.  The one thing I'll comment about that language is that it's what around Richmond we called the 'would-might' clause, and this isn't m-i-tIt's m-i-g-h-t.  In the directives in the 1980s and 1990s, we had this clause that was published either 'would' warrant and 'would' was viewed as more strong than 'might,' and so that next rate change.  Apparently the practice was wouldn't want to and trying to get too fancy I guidance by introducing C, the description of conditions-running dropping reminiscent of e. after the next meeting, and it would list a bunch of conditions and say tighter conditions or 'might,' was our way of signaling our tilt or bias about the to tinker with the order of these things to send subtle signals to markets, and I get into the business of us tinkering with the order of these things about it.  Just putting it in as more or less boilerplate language that describes how we think about this would be the right approach to that.

on the language innovation in paragraph 2 of B in the second It says, 'The Committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming policy.'  This ties highly accommodative monetary policy to gradually I read it, seems to say that we are going to maintain highly economic growth picks up gradually.  I don't view us as having Then I want to comment sentence. quarters'-that's great-'and then to pick up gradually'-that's great-'supported by highly accommodative monetary picking up growth.  This, as accommodative policy, even as discussed that a lot.  This strikes me as more forward guidance, forward guidance in another

Thus, I'm comfortable MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'm broken analogies.

Yet, empirical work by my staff highlights that monetary similarly to previous periods, with the exception of residential consistent with the staff memo on the attenuation of monetary if we have unemployment above 7 percent in I think the answer is yes.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Although I don't think today change our policy stance-in that sense, I think alternative B is the right direction to go-I do think it is very likely that economic conditions will warrant sooner than 2014.  Indeed, based on my forecast, I believe reducing the level of accommodation as soon as either late this large error bands around our forecast, especially those two or three that our signaling that policy is likely to remain on hold for two or three having more of a detrimental impact than a positive one on the real economy.

The big we commit, and can we deliver on a credible around as our forecast changes.  There is a variety of views around this a little bit of both of them. as to what we are doing and If we want to make a commitment to a price-level target, we should do that, and then If we want to make a forecast, then the date ought to change it. There the calendar from models in which challenge with that framework of course is, can commitment to do so?  Another interpretation is that it is a forecast, and if it is a forecast then the dates should be moving table about which of those is in action here.

So I am dubious I prefer the more I they tell me.  What we know from our memo that we received before the optimal control in different types of models depending on the model of relying too heavily on a particular model's optimal control, which is why

And so, in my view, the us in kind of 'Never Never Land.'  We are neither fish nor fowl.  I think confusing to the public, and it is something we need to move away from.  There is from the I will just leave it at that, Mr. Chairman. For some to move to either a price-level target or '2014' language leaves that is very not an easy solution to this.  I proposed one to consider, but we need to move away calendar date language to a more contingent statement.

accommodative monetary policy stance that reduces resource slack more quickly consensus policy framework, and most likely inflation would not Tealbook B, and the favor a strongly than our SEP and Tealbook projections.  The preponderance of macroeconomic analyses indicate that this can be done without generating inflation above a rate that would violate our agreedupon balanced-approach increase to anywhere near those upper thresholds.  That is evident from the comments that Janet made.

greater commitment to the optimal control monetary policy makes a lot of me-it would generate better outcomes.  The comments about how we should keep the Rosengren's suggestion calendar date language should meet a heavy burden before we undertake Displaying a sense to funds rate lower longer-that would be excellent.  I agree with President that the change to our that.

B is the front-runner today, I would like to argue alternative B.  That is, unless can the calendar date policy intentions from last I have in mind that we are facing a couple of dilemmas with our implementation along the President Kocherlakota and President Lacker have already mentioned. from the voting members.  In January, we picked up another vocal public commentary as we go out and talk, there appear to be six much less accommodation with a federal funds liftoff in either 2012 or projections cannot Now, recognizing that in fact alternative for at least maintaining the status quo within our implementation of a subtle policy tightening is intended today, how August, January, and March be maintained in their effectiveness when we implement alternative B? lines of some things that First, we have to remember that back in August when we introduced the calendar date language, it came with three disagreements disagreement, so there are differences of opinion clearly.  And according to our SEP submissions, and a very participants who prefer 2013.  From this observation, it seems to follow immediately that the SEP

April 24-25, 2012

impart the status quo forward guidance intended by the August, January, and March FOMC statements.  A different choice was made than was evident in the SEP.

number one, SEPs don't seem to work in clarifying our 'late 2014' it out.  So now what?  Second dilemma, describing 'late 2014' as simply a would say misleading.  And as Narayana mentioned, the public is about this.  Our scenario exercise yesterday and Govenor To recap, dilemma forward guidance.  That is a feature.  We just can't point to the SEPs and hope that the public is going to figure forecast is incomplete, and I confused over how we are talking Yellen's speech last week provide the explanation for why just a forecast is an incomplete explanation.

FOMC to keep the federal funds rate at 'at least through late 2014' combines three features-one, an outlook for the economy; two, economy and inflation outlooks change.  This Committee's, or at least the core of the Committee's, President Kocherlakota was optimistic that from a common reaction function, and I would certainly delight in discovering that such a thing, but the SEPs, at least, suggest differently.  Effective guidance requires, first, adequately describing the monetary August, January, and March decisions.  Then forecast is different, whether output is growing faster or slower, some idea of how we A statement that conditions will likely lead the zero an assessment of inflation pressures; and, three, very importantly, a concrete view of how the FOMC will alter the federal funds rate when the last condition is a statement of the monetary policy reaction function.  Now, yesterday we are not far that is true, that we have communication of our 'late 2014' policy response function that was intended by the we assess whether the unemployment is improving, and what not.  But we have to give the public are responding.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, all of functions, and the like make things like that something like a Taylor have started discussions today.  Various staff analyses have suggested that there is, in fact, a basis for that within have different views, so it strikes me that unanimous consent seems beyond our grasp on this issue, and, frankly, only by alternative

I think our baseline narrative on the economy is a relatively large going forward.  One important aspect of path is that a fairly rapid return to that growth path is a reliable feature of the data across times and places.

I found myself referring to what I have found over the years to be the In the past, we have had to study I found myself explain some of the disagreement around the table example, one meaning of the word 'late' is 'occurring after the correct I think President Lacker is actually thinking that that is [laughter] the definition A synonym is 'tardy,' by the way.  But actually the definition of 'late' that I think I do support alternative B in the MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In thinking about the monetary policy decision in the statement, most useful resource, and that is the dictionary.

rules, and I am a little concerned about Vice Now, I am about to talk about Taylor Chairman Dudley's headache, so I did bring some aspirin.

It will cost you a buck, though. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.

I'll suffer.  [Laughter] VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

My thinking about the appropriate future path of policy is informed analysis of simple monetary policy rules, appropriately adjusted for the effects of the zero In terms of simple rules, regression analysis shows that the Taylor good description of historical FOMC behavior since the mid-1980s, the similarly find that the (1999) rule provides a decent description of a participant's fed reported in the Tealbook B, such a policy rule rule. MR. WILLIAMS. by the lower bound and LSAPs. (1999) rule is a pretty period of well-anchored inflation expectations.  Various staff studies unemployment-based Taylor funds projections from the January SEP.  And, as implies liftoff in the first quarter of 2014.  But that is not the end of the story.  One also needs to take into account the implications of unconventional monetary policy actions and the zero bound in considering the prescriptions of a historical policy of the LSAPs, so it is possible to implement But there are reasons to believe that this adjustment overstates the effectiveness LSAPs.  Research on the effects of our LSAP and MEP programs suggests a portion of the Treasury markets and does not fully pass through to In terms of an LSAP adjustment to the policy rule, the memo by the staff Minneapolis Fed circulated by President Kocherlakota was very helpful to my thinking. Tealbook B now reports term premium estimates from the that adjustment. of term premium effect is idiosyncratic to

April 24-25, 2012

Treasury yield, reductions in the term rough attempt to take account of this partial pass-through to general private rates.  That is, for a given reduction in the 10-year premiums through LSAPs don't stimulate the economy as much as reductions in the expected path of short rates.  As a financial conditions, I cut the policy rule adjustments suggested by the Minneapolis memo roughly in half.

as much monetary stimulus as the historical policy rule would call for because of the zero so-called which the funds rate was too high in every quarter because of the zero adjustments for LSAPs, the MEP, and the Reifschneider-Williams I should note that a little earlier than would be implied from using the Tealbook projection, because Now, even with this adjustment for unconventional monetary policies, we have not been adding bound.  Fortunately, research tells us how to correct for this shortfall.  The Reifschneider-Williams adjustment at a zero lower bound argues it is optimal to deviate from the usual policy rule and keep the federal funds rate lower than otherwise for a longer period. Namely, the Reifschneider-Williams adjustment keeps track of the monetary policy deficit that is a cumulative amount by bound constraint.  Once the zero bound ceases to bind, it calls for reductions in the policy rule prescription until this accumulated policy deficit is unwound.  Relative to the historical policy rule, we have accumulated a large monetary policy deficit since 2008.  And using my forecast for the economy, and after adjustment, the historical policy rule has liftoff in the third quarter of 2014. this liftoff is my forecast has a bit less slack and slightly higher inflation than the Tealbook does.

conclude by commenting on the risks to the outlook, which I view as being risks to the outlook materialize.  Finally, in response to Governor Yellen's am fine with associating names in our internal presentation of SEPs.  I am, in fact, Let me mostly to the downside.  Alternative A lays out two options that would be appropriate if these significant downside questions, I

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.

I get into my own MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Before remarks, I had a question for President Williams about the Reifschneider-Williams analysis. The purpose of offering a correction for the deficit is to stimulate activity during the periods when you are incurring the deficit.

MR. WILLIAMS.  That is exactly right.

right? MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  So, people at the time-2008 and 2009-would have to know that the Committee was planning to make that correction for it to be helpful, is that you will do this correction.  One way I interpret it, if I can go on forward language is an attempt to try to align expectations of the MR. WILLIAMS.  Right.  In the model simulations, the way it works is that the public understands and anticipates that a little about this, is that the public with our policy strategy.

I do favor alternative C.  It might be helpful to MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you.  Mr. Chairman, clearly, this is not going to be a winning recommendation at this meeting, but describe my thinking behind that.

(1999) rule, and so in terms of the thinking about the real interest rate Vice Chairman Dudley talked about yesterday, I had always been gap piece as being an attempt to correct for the fact that during bad course, a question about whether that adjustment I used the Taylor component of that that thinking about the output times the real interest rate is low.  There is, of is sufficient or not, and that would be a useful discussion to have:  If we don't think the Taylor

April 24-25, 2012

good job in the current environment, how can we amend it or think about (1999) rule is doing a it?  I will come back to that at the end of my remarks.

I have been using the Taylor (1999) rule largely, Mr. Chairman, since you suggested guide for the Committee's thinking in November 2010.  I was struggling in that together the LSAPs and our conventional monetary policy into one approach you laid out at that meeting was extremely helpful for me, and I been going forward with that.  From the memos we got from the staff and from Glenn others around this table seem to be using that But it as a useful meeting with how to put bundle.  I thought the have Rudebusch in San Francisco, one could infer that rule to guide their thinking.

(1999) rule, we need an estimate of the output gap, and I argued go-round-and I am sympathetic to the things that President Bullard has to be less negative than the staff's estimate which alternative to choose, for purposes of used the staff's assessment that the output gap also need an estimate of inflation.  I used the will use the staff's prediction.  So if (1999), staff's prediction for the output gap, and (1999) recommends we provide a level of minus 80 basis points. Now, to use the Taylor in the economics already uttered-that I think the output gap is likely indicates.  But for the purposes of thinking about what the appropriate stance of policy should be, I is expected to be minus 4.3 percent in 2013.  I staff's prediction that core inflation will be 1½ percent in 2013.  Again, that is considerably lower than my own forecast for inflation, but that's fine-I we put all of these ingredients together-Taylor staff's prediction for core inflation in 2013-Taylor accommodation equivalent to a fed funds rate of is being provided by alternative C?  Under alternative C, the between 0 and 25 basis points, which is too high.  But we have an How much accommodation fed funds rate would be additional accommodation being provided through our asset holdings.  As President Williams

April 24-25, 2012

estimates of the term premium reductions being found this very helpful and could combine in thinking about how that translates into fed funds rate reductions. Minneapolis formula would generate a reduction in the fed funds rate of (1999) is recommending a fed funds rate of minus 80 points. between accommodative relative of Taylor (1999), but it is better than alternatives A and B.  I prefer has already remarked, it is great that we have the provided by the time path of assets in Tealbook B.  I that with my staff's work Under alternative C, the roughly 120 basis points.  Taylor Alternative C implies a level of accommodation that is equivalent to a fed funds rate of minus 120 and minus 95 basis points, so alternative C is slightly overly to the recommendations paragraph 3.1 because I see it as less accommodative.

a rule-based approach to thinking about the problem, and I will explain to you I reached the conclusion I did.  There are three things about this calculation I see as worth any attenuation of the impact of monetary got from Chung et al. did not seem to suggest a any attenuation into account.  I haven't done the correction that President Williams LSAPs.  I don't think it would That is how emphasizing.  First, it does not take into account policy.  My reading of the very nice memo we need to take suggested of marking down the accommodation provided by the actually make a big difference in my conclusion about policy at this meeting.

I treated new and existing asset As I just described, Taylor says to set the fed funds rate to some negative number-minus 80 basis points.  Some generate more accommodation It acts Second-this is the big thing-I want to emphasize that holdings symmetrically in terms of their accommodative impact. (1999) people will conclude from this result that we need to buy assets to because the fed funds rate is currently too high.  This approach strikes me as asymmetric. like the new asset purchases can provide accommodation, but we should be ignoring the

April 24-25, 2012

assets we have bought in the past.  I can't figure out the accommodation provided by any justification for this procedure.

emphasized that I used staff measures for the output gap and predicted inflation. I used Minneapolis measures for these variables, my analysis would have implied a less alternative C.  In other words, the Minneapolis measures imply that B are exposing us to a threat of rising inflation. Third, I Had accommodative stance than alternatives like A or close by offering two thoughts on what strike me as a key question.  I have (1999), taking into account the LSAPs.  Under the Tealbook's modal outlook, using (1999) as I have, both employment and inflation will remain below mandate-consistent years to come.  Why, then, do I believe that we should formulate policy based on (1999) as I have?  Well, first, Tealbook's modal outlook is not the same as my modal I had used Minneapolis measures of the output gap and projected inflation to that the dual mandate performance of Taylor (1999) considerably better. Let me arrived at my policy recommendation using Taylor accommodation being provided by the Taylor levels for many Taylor outlook.  If formulate a Tealbook outlook, I suspect would be

get to what I think is more the heart of the issue.  Several of us-Governor making policy.  President Bullard just did this as well.  Using these in a number of ways.  They improve the mis-specification, as President Bullard just track whether we claim to be doing.  But by their very nature, simple rules will necessarily But let me Yellen, President Williams, President Plosser, myself-have spoken in favor of using simple rules as a benchmark for kinds of rules enhances the effectiveness of policy robustness of our decisionmaking to model emphasized.  They improve our ability to communicate a reaction function to the public.  They improve the public's trust in that communication by allowing them to easily are doing the things we

It was else out there in the world.  And the memo only considered It would be good to build on their analysis by adjusted to allow for the LSAPs by the Committee. Now, there are other simple rules besides Taylor I think that the Erceg compare the performance of various rules.  But a defect in that memo, from my point of view, is it didn't really somehow being set by somebody rule performance in a limited number of scenarios. evaluating the long-run average performance of simple rules that are purposeful use of

I saw from the scenario analysis, that we could reach a Evans, but it may still be broad enough to sustain a robust regarding what its reaction function would look I do have hopes, based on what broad consensus within the Committee about a reaction function.  That broad consensus may not include me or President communication on the part of the Committee like.

I'm you will be lumping with people who are nonvoters this year I thought the approach we adopted of trying to provide more communication about the likely arc of policy through the SEP is problematic, and it's flawed.  I have said this before.  In terms of solutions, I heard your suggestion, Governor Yellen-you can correct me if wrong-is to put diamonds for the permanent members of the Committee.  That does seem fussy to me in the following sense:  It seems to be distinguishing between voters.  There will be people who are voters now this year that

April 24-25, 2012

seem appropriate to me from a governance and treating them the same in that.  That doesn't perspective.  All voters should be treated the same.

with what President Evans was saying today.  I just think the SEP as a way to try to communicate about the arc of policy.  The statement is B is trying to say.  It needs that clarification, and I am going to be able to do that.  I don't think the SEP is providing that clarification, and to do that.  Thank you. But at the heart, I agree is structurally flawed our vehicle.  You, Mr. Chairman, have the opportunity through the press conference to offer some clarification about what alternative glad you are there are no simple fixes to it that will allow it

Let me ask you one question-which I don't know the not a lawyer-about your LSAP analysis.  If you are looking at a rule, would it matter if the funds rate had been much lower two years earlier or In other words, to what extent does your current setting of a current Taylor rule depend on stimulative actions that have been CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. answer to, because I am standard Taylor not so much lower two years earlier? the interest rate based on taken, say, two years earlier?  I think the answer is it wouldn't depend at all.

economy.  They have had way that lagged interest rate movements have are taking into account on the right-hand side that is already taking place-in some sense already that through that mechanism? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Exactly.  So why doesn't that apply to LSAPs?  The LSAP actions we took in March of 2009 presumably have spread to the effects on output, inflation, and so on, in the same had their effects.  So why doesn't the fact that we the projected value of output and inflation-maybe not entirely because there may be effects still to come, but at least the part of the effect account for

April 24-25, 2012

It's an interesting question.  I have to think about it more, Mr. accommodation to the economy.  Taylor (1999) is trying to guide us in terms that we are MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Chairman.  My immediate reaction is that the Committee has taken a purposeful step to reduce the term premium, and that is providing accommodation to the economy, and it is going to continue providing of how to think about what that level of accommodation is.  My immediate answer is doing it the right way in terms of treating it in this fashion.

Lacker. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.  President

MR. LACKER.  Mr. Chairman?

at which point the equation drives LSAPs.  See what I'm saying? MR. LACKER.  At the risk of making Vice Chairman Dudley's head hurt, LSAPs are another policy instrument.  They kind of belong on the left-hand side in combination.  In other words, what is on the right-hand side is an output gap and other stuff, and it drives the funds rate until it gets to zero, the Taylor rule. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You are just restating

you don'tI think at least some of that let's President Fisher. MR. LACKER.  Yes.  But from that point of view, I think he is right in that CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It's not obvious to me because effect is already captured in the growth and inflation numbers on the right-hand side, but leave that to another time.

Appropriate policy, in my outlook, has a federal second quarter of 2014, and I called for meeting, my staff worked to enhance our forecasting framework to include a policy adjusts more cautiously than the implementation of the using as a incoming data, particularly for the first federal funds reaction function, which includes an inertial component.  This function worked well when we examined past decision points; it also worked well in the alternative scenario exercise that we discussed yesterday. that needs to be adhered to.  Subsequently, it has turned out that this reaction function matches up well with the version of the Taylor rule that Board staff have fit to the Committee's January projections.

resulted in some adjustment of the liftoff January, my forecast growth, employment, and inflation, using the new guidepost, was consistent with a late for economic growth and the unemployment rate has moved down.  Now guide suggests a liftoff in the first or second quarter of 2014, and the fed funds the end of 2014. Changes in my forecast since January have guidance, even with this improved guidepost for appropriate policy.  As of for GDP 2014 liftoff of the fed funds rate.  But since then, my projections inflation have moved up while my projection for the new policy rate reaches 1 percent by

April 24-25, 2012

maintaining the late 2014 date?  Well, I recognize that there are views of the long-run agreement, but as of yet we have not been able to agree on language describing implications of normal levels of forecast uncertainty on policy rules. Uncertainty about output, unemployment, and inflation has followed mechanically.  In their calculations, typical levels of GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation implied a confidence interval that spans early 2013 through the end of 2015. So why am I supporting important differences in our outlooks, our reaction functions, and in our unemployment rate.  I would prefer, as others have noted today, to use data thresholds to find a greater sense of data-driven thresholds.  That leaves us with a date, but it is hard for me to be dogmatic about any particular date, given the We all routinely acknowledge in our SEP submissions that uncertainty is large, and even that it might be larger than typical. implications for policy uncertainty.  My staff used a model simulation to estimate how uncertain policy is even if a rule is uncertainty surrounding forecasts of 70 percent

I am willing to support no change in around turning points, a higher hurdle to making policy, and I am not confident enough about the outlook for economic I support no change in the date language today is that we are constrained by readily tighten policyTaylor, but we cannot readily ease if further accommodation is In addition to this uncertainty, another reason that the date today is that policy has acted gradually in the past, particularly and I support this cautious approach.  I also think that there should be changes to the stance of growth and inflation over the next few quarters to begin tightening policy today.  And yet another reason that the zero lower bound.  As others have noted, if the recovery strengthens, and inflation worsens, we can necessary.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

B, including for this language, but I would like to register some reservations.  First, I think for this meeting is minimal change.  That said, I'm comfortable with a in the statement and my expectation of the emphasized, I'm seeing the 'late language as increasingly untenable.  My forecast is similar to the Tealbook forecast, assumptions about appropriate policy, and it has been noted by others that three quarters since the 'late 2014' published. MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative meeting, the 'late 2014' the best course of action growing disconnect between the 2014 date language policy liftoff date.  Even with the conditionality of the guidance 2014' including my baseline the Tealbook has brought forward the liftoff date by language was originally

I was comfortable supporting the 'late 2014' language because at closer to mid-2014-this is very similar to what far out, I didn't see a conditionality into the statement.  President a state-contingent approach, and President Rosengren mentioned triggers. the same idea.  This is not on the table at this meeting, so I'll just forward guidance in economic thresholds.  A move in that direction might allow, in time, against various Taylor rule specifications, and we concluded that the liftoff date is At the last meeting, that time my forecast showed something President Pianalto just related.  Given the imprecision of forecasting that material difference versus later in 2014.  Since then, however, the mismatch between my projected liftoff date and late 2014 has become more pronounced.  I still think one way to resolve some of this conflict is to introduce economic Plosser referred to These are all thematically register my continued support for moving in the direction of expressing terms of some form of dropping the date language.  In my view, we need to move the conversation to economic conditionality.  This is an appeal to keep trying.  Further on that point, my staff did a review of our forecast highly sensitive to very small differences in economic assumptions in forecasts.  Even when we

use the outcome-based 1999 version of the Taylor rule described in the Tealbook, we get liftoff dates that vary substantially when plugging in forecasts that, to my mind, are not very different one from the other.

is in I believe President Lacker said.  It's best not to change the language unless I think this the comfortable with considering the divergent forecasts of liftoff opposite the 'late 2014' B.  I would simply stick to the March version.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to also make a couple of points about the draft statement language, and this line with what required to address some perceived change in circumstances and outlook.  The March statement read, 'The Committee expects moderate economic growth over coming quarters.' characterization is still correct, and I don't see the gain from the proposed new verbiage that distinguishes between coming quarters and the medium term and lengthens, in effect, the horizon of the outlook.  As the staff notes, the inclusion of this language may have the effect of sending members of the public to the SEPs for clarification.  If this is the case, it would only promote view that the FOMC statement should be interpreted through the SEPs.  Many in the room have questioned whether that really does provide much clarification.  I'm not very that approach, particularly guidance, and for that reason I would not make the changes contemplated in the current draft of alternative

DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to talk about the SEP first and then I'll turn to policy.  As a I think of it as the comments about communicating through the SEP.  If we're separating voters appropriate to separate out the voters from the nonvoters in the outlook items, and I hope we

April 24-25, 2012

before we go to a voter versus a nonvoter SEP.  Finally, if I compare the with the results of the alternative I get more information out of the results of the alternative simulation I actually get out of the dot charts.  Nevertheless, in January we published our economic first time markets could compare the participants' individual assessments think long and carefully various dot charts and scattergrams of the fed funds projections simulation exercise, exercise than individual assessments of the appropriate fed funds target, along with projections of results, and so for the of appropriate policy with the statement of the Committee's collective judgment.

close to the March Tealbook.  Now we're adding a third piece of changes in the outlook and changes in individual policy will influence policy actions of the Committee and, in particular, guidance of the statement.  It's not a single opportunity but an ongoing Then in March, immediately following the statement issuance, even without an SEP, markets seemed to intuit that the upgrade of the outlook that was contained in the statement would correspond to a liftoff two quarters earlier than the January statement had indicated, a conclusion that was eerily information, the change in the individual views on the appropriate path of interest rates.  This will allow markets to triangulate the way that views about appropriate the date and the forward one, and I believe that markets will come to understand it even better than we could express it today, in part because markets are simply focused on understanding and predicting, while each of us is also formulating and articulating our own ideas about how it should work and trying to influence the outcome.

for this meeting, I spent most of my energy trying to think about how to us to begin raising the fed funds target before sense is not yet a conviction, and I have some reluctance to move in one In preparing think about the date in the forward guidance in light of changes in the outlook.  My own sense is that the building economic momentum will allow the end of 2014, but that

April 24-25, 2012

an extinguishment of the likelihood of further accommodation and, thus, I don't have that level of direction and then reverse.  Furthermore, a pulling forward of the date could also be interpreted as a reduction or even have an even stronger-than-expected market reaction.  I know conviction in my forecast.

For the moment I'm happy with alternative B.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So if the data are coming in mixed as convincing sturdy enough to withstand potential shocks.  If economic performance does appear to be faltering or if measures rather than moving out the date in the statement.  If the strength or if some of the data puzzles resolve in the direction of more strength than we realized, then I'd be tempted to pull forward the date.  However, while might be important, I view a change of direction as especially important, and we should think about pulling forward the date as a the language in

I hope that the expectation that by two months from now things correct, but it seems to me not inconceivable that we're differently moving data between now and then as well, at which point I think it is useful that the staff has produced some memos on potential additional measures if those are called for. are clarified one way or another proves going to have somewhat

April 24-25, 2012

going to have to start thinking about whether in a situation of continued mixed information we're and uncertainty, the current monetary policy stance is appropriate.

I thought Jeff made a lot of very important points.  The I would have slightly disagreed with was that he about pulling the date forward, and it's at least conceivable that it could go further But I thought everything else he said really posed important questions for gravamen of what he was saying was that there is was that there's an instability in the statement itself one way or another because of On the SEP-first, I want to say only thing in his affirmative presentation that talked only back at some moment. us to think about, and I would say much of the a disconnect between what is going on in the statement and what is going on in the SEP.  I guess a corollary the date.

was a proponent of trying to move toward the use of projections, and I still am, but I am doing so in the peculiar institutional framework other central banks around the world.  I thought it at the time, and I I thought we might be able to modify the SEP once in place.  I do is When I say the idiosyncrasies-we have no you in the Reserve Banks with your armies of support staffs [laughter] in your I even more impressed now with the difficulties of that we have got relative to raised some of the issues. think it's adding to transparency but not to effective communication, and because the goal effective communication, it does seem to me we're going to have to think pretty hard about both it and paragraph 3 language in the June meeting. real connection now between the SEP and the collective process.  We all do our projections as a single matter.  Those of us on the Board in splendid isolation-it's just us and our computers. Those of offices-but they're all done individually, and then they're just aggregated.

As several of us were talking about in the period preceding our adoption of the SEP, every other central bank that has a projection process has some kind of collective or

April 24-25, 2012

Sweden or, for that matter, in Britain, are likely to be effective in this with the individual and the projections are individual exercises. collaborative element to that process before the projection is published.  I don't think that the models that exist in Committee, which is way larger than others and geographically dispersed.  But there needs to be some institutional mechanism that ties a collective judgment together exercises of making projections, because right now we leave it to the Chairman to have to explain that the statement is a collective exercise But they're both hanging out there, and it does exacerbate communications difficulties.

go both ways on identifying current and noncurrent voters.  On you're saying 2014 is your current date, then the saying, 'Ah, going to be voting a couple of years from now,' again an I'm ambivalent on that one, but I do think something that and into a format that has more of a collective element to it is going best neutral and at worst confusing.  Thank On the specific ideas, I the one hand, I don't think it quite solves the problem.  It's still a scatterpoint presentation, which is a problem.  On the other hand, ironically, if public should be more interested in who's voting in late 2013 and early 2014 than who's voting in 2012.  So in an odd way, by identifying the current nonpermanent voters, you're these guys, you know, they're not idiosyncrasy of the Federal Reserve. gets us out of scatterpoints to be critical so this thing doesn't end up being at you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.

MR. PLOSSER.  Mr. Chairman, can I?

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.

find myself agreeing with almost everything Dan said, and I'm with just data-part of the problem we're having is because we've got the date MR. PLOSSER.  I wanting people to consider two things:  One, rather than thinking there's something wrong the SEP-because it's

April 24-25, 2012

Getting the date out of the statement and talking would make the conflict way I see it, would be-President Bullard brought this up yesterday, report where you could the SEPs, the statements, and the frameworks you might agree that there is a modal outlook from the SEPs you toward a consensus of the Committee.  There are opportunities between date out of the statement and doing a monetary policy report that can take us forward The second step, the I brought it up on several occasions-the notion of a monetary policy then combine the strengths and information from and have a fuller discussion, where that would point getting the to resolve the kind of conflicts that we're all struggling with.

I would only say that I'm a little less sanguine on the monetary as an anchoring device for that collective judgment.  At best, though, it forward guidance both by removing the date or any substitute for the date maintaining a confusing scatterpoint presentation, on the MR. TARULLO.  But policy report serving would take time to do that.  I wouldn't want to give up-and to a considerable extent it would be giving up-the use of in paragraph 3, on the one hand, while other.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Governor Raskin.

B, but not without a interpreted by an interpretation that could eventually effectively make them MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, support alternative vague sense that the actions taken today, i.e., no action, could be eventually markets as being contractionary, contractionary.

We have done quite a bit, but the economy continues recognize that there's uncertainty about how effective monetary policy can be at the I read with interest the staff's memo on the attenuation of the effects of monetary evidence that various parts of the monetary I did not conclude that all of the channels are policy is highly current stance of monetary policy is just not I moment. policy.  I took from this memo that there is some transmission mechanism have been impaired.  But inoperable.  Rather, I concluded that the transmission mechanism is only partially impaired.  In that case, it's entirely possible that our usual measures of whether monetary accommodative, that is, that rates are very low, may be misleading.  When some channels of transmission are clogged, it may be that the sufficient for the magnitude of the crisis.

at this point, I am concerned about the signal do nothing, the greater is the chance that we If we are perceived as being satisfied, and many on this Committee will satisfied, then markets will interpret us as having done the best we can. economy will visibly contract and slow down. While we may not be prepared to do more we send by communicating doing nothing.  For those of us who believe the economy is still in slog mode, there is the concern that the longer we are unintentionally communicating that we are satisfied.  'Mission accomplished' should not be the message of the day. talk publicly about being Financial conditions will tighten.  The to counteract what will be a growing sense that we are are satisfied waiting for many more years in order to get us close to our message strikes me as the exact opposite of one we have discussed in meet our mandate could all by itself have a salutary effect on markets We've done nothing today finished and that we statutory mandate.  This the past.  We've discussed that sending a clear message to markets that we are committed to do everything necessary to

I hope that is not the message the public takes from our meeting and have an with the current path of the economy, this could work like contractionary we need right now in my today.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.

My problem is not with the rule itself, per se.  It's useful to have rules problem is the enshrinement of the equilibrium real rate assumption of and how we use the rule in practice.  Right now, the actual real rate that we're using roughly 12 basis points is roughly minus 1½, 1¾ percent, depending on you measure it.  We're supposedly running a monetary policy that's 4 percentage about how we have this exceptionally policy.  Yet, when we observe what kind of economic growth we get policy, we see growth that's not very good. 2¼ percent 2½ percent.  So it accommodative as we current environment, given the financial crisis, real rate significantly VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Well, I think I'm going to have to take another run at the Taylor rule.  [Laughter] as guides to policy.  My 2¼ percent with the funds rate of exactly how points easy, and this is why we keep talking accommodative monetary from this exceptionally accommodative monetary The past four quarters, including the first quarter of 3 percent growth, gives us growth over the past four quarters, and the Tealbook forecast for 2012 is seems to me that the logical conclusion is that policy isn't as exceptionally think it is because the equilibrium real rate in the the impediments to housing finance, et cetera, have pushed the equilibrium lower.

I take a lower equilibrium real rate and put it into the Taylor rule and then asking people is to answer the question, why has economic growth disappointed so much Now, if calculate what the appropriate time of exit is, that's going to push back the timing of exit.  All I'm

April 24-25, 2012

running a very accommodative monetary policy?  And doesn't that all I'm asking, just to consider that question.  If you reject that way of thinking your view is of why we're not growing faster given policy that we supposedly have in place. relative to the fact that we're raise a question about whether policy isn't as accommodative as we thought and that maybe the equilibrium real rate in the current environment isn't 2¼ percent, but it's somewhat lower? That's really about things, I'd like to understand then what the very accommodative

Taylor rule that is worth discussing, and we'll do this more in the that the Taylor rule also doesn't consider the asymmetries of the losses your forecast.  If the economy is much weaker than we expect, if we a bad draw and we end up in a debt-deflation trap, the losses there are enormous. grows faster than we expect, we would actually probably be pretty potential inflation consequence, but we could more quickly, and we could catch up.  The Taylor rule in no way asymmetry of that payoff function.  So even if you took the Taylor rule literally and asymmetry in terms of loss forecast.  Okay, that's it for the Taylor rule until June. The second issue on the June meeting, I think, is in terms of errors around get Conversely, if the economy delighted by that.  Now, there would be some tighten monetary policy weights the said that a 2¼ percent equilibrium rate was the right rate, you still would probably want to follow a policy somewhat easier than the Taylor rule because of the functions around your ending up in terms a tension between the SEP projections and the statement and language.  I support Governor Yellen's suggestions in terms of identifying the It would be a good idea to also identify permanent versus nonpermanent Turning now to the SEP, I think we all accept the fact that we're not very happy with how the SEP projections are not elucidating where the Committee is actually of the Committee decision.  There's the 'late 2014' names internally. members because that allows the public to understand how to weight the circles a little bit better.

April 24-25, 2012

confusion-I don't think it going a little bit further.  One thing we should consider:  Is there a way to come up that sufficiently frame the forecast in a way really should fix the SEP in the sense of economic variables, I'm happy with it with it being done with our names attached.  I would say if to see where we actually stand on having And if we really think we want to be transparent, we want to reduce solves the SEP problem, but it would probably push it somewhat in the right direction-I would also favor with threshold variables?  We still need to work on that.  The problem we've found is it's hard to come up with a small number of threshold variables that we're comfortable with them.  I also think we publishing forecasts that link the interest rate outcomes with the real-side and I would argue that we should just publish the matrix of the forecasts. being done anonymously.  I'm happy we were to attach our names, then the Chairman should be excluded from the exercise in that case.  But we should take a straw poll or something System forecasts linked together and disclosed to the public because that would also provide some additional information.

I want to talk about is our own SEP submission.  New York's SEP has additional balance sheet stimulus included, and that was a very close downside action.  If the The next thing submission still actually call for us.  Should we have it in or should we have it out?  At the end of the day, our view was that we think it's likely at some point that the economy will be weak enough or the risks will be great enough that we'll want to do an additional balance sheet economy obviously doesn't disappoint or the downside risk diminishes, then we would take it out.

talk a little bit about is what happens if the economy actually does What I want to disappoint.  One thing that we need to be prepared for is that we could come in at the June meeting disappointed about the economic outlook in terms of how the economy has performed,

April 24-25, 2012

we wanted to offer up It is going to be particularly germane obviously because conclusion at the end of the June meeting.  I tried to would rely on balance have so little insight I think extending the a very small consequence.  Then it's the choice between another maturity LSAP as alternative A asked myself the question, how I prioritize those two?  Assuming that longer-term inflation expectations were still well and haven't changed-in other words, we're not in a situation like we were in 2010 come down on the side of doing the maturity extension program.  The economy.  And the costs of the MEP seem to be about the or worried about the downside risks that maybe have increased over the period.  But we have not yet had a discussion about what we would actually do at that meeting if additional monetary policy stimulation. the maturity extension program comes to a think about this and asked myself the question, what would I do?  I think I sheet rather than date because extending the date just lacks credibility.  We into how the economy is going to evolve in 2013, 2014, and beyond that date would have extension program, which is one alternative in alternative A, and another suggests-the mortgage-backed securities program-and so I would anchored where people were worried about the U.S. going the route of Japan and inflation expectations are falling significantly-I reason for that is that if we're not trying to push up inflation expectations, the benefits of the MEP versus MBS purchase program seem to be about the same as near as we can measure in terms of how much stimulus they provide to the somewhat lower in the sense that we've seen that the market is not at all concerned MEP in terms of creating an anxiety about longer-term inflation because it's not associated with balance sheet expansion.

contrasts with when we do something that expands the balance sheet.  Even though us around the table don't think there's going to be any long-term inflation consequence expansion because of the ability to pay interest on excess reserves and This many of from that balance sheet

draining tools, it doesn't really matter what we think.  If there are people in the who are worried about the inflation consequences of that, then that is a cost of going also think that We concluded the program, and then we decided worked well, and so we decided more.  We would still have the ability to our other reserve market down that course.  That tells me that the MEP has a better cost-benefit tradeoff.  I there will be less drama in extending the MEP. we could do more.  It do an LSAP in reserve.

I thought was interesting is that when we did the MEP program, the market did LSAPs, and that's actually very useful because one important an LSAP and the MEP is that the LSAP actually is open-ended.  You can do you want in principle.  The MEP, by necessity, will at some point be exhausted, you more.  Having the LSAP possibility in reserve, an open-ended tool, I feel something in reserve that by its nature is very One thing not significantly reduce its expectations of the possibility of us doing an LSAP.  They didn't read the MEP as ruling out future difference between as much as won't be able to do any a little bit more comfortable with that than having limited.

Just happened since January, the economy is mostly evolving along the lines of other words, we've from our forecast is actually extraordinarily modest.  Not only that, it has virtually no implications for the outlook in 2013 and 2014 because as we went around the table, I don't think any of us think that the downside risks really lessened significantly.  So marginally stronger in terms of the sort of downside risk, means your outlook in 2013 and 2014.

There are enormous risks involved, are costs involved that offset the benefits that President Dudley elucidated. MR. FISHER.  Just for the sake of the minutes since President Dudley made an extensive argument about described.

B.  I do think that maintaining the 'late 2014' arguments for the particular timing, specifically that Taylor (1999) applied to the SEP projections still gives us something unlike the Taylor rules, it does take into account the zero lower bound and the commitment possibility.  But even the optimal control exercise doesn't take greater than the upside risks, nor the asymmetry of There's broad support for alternative language is still appropriate.  Bill English gave some good noting below 1 percent at the end of 2014.  Like Governor Yellen, I take some input from the optimal control exercise because concerns into account downside risks, which I think are the risks in terms of the ability to respond to those risks.

I agree with will be slightly contractionary, given both the SEP March meeting as opposed to January because of the lack of change in From with Governor Raskin that this entire package and the fact that we're not acting on the MEP today, but it would be very hard to understand a shift in policy from the the outlook since March.

look ahead and say, 'We'll get more information between this meeting good deal of information that we'll be getting, and we need economy is going to go before we take further action. What we are looking at is a great deal of uncertainty about how this recovery is going to proceed.  We can always and the next one.'  There is, in fact, a a better conviction about which way the

Lacker's points about this being a forecast, and in fact, I myself.  I do think that this would be interpreted first as a reversal, I also agree with a number of people around the table that we need to we can.  In that would support the view that a lot of people had that we need to do better on the SEP of changing the at what improvements that we can make to the SEP that we I take very seriously President have said similar things which would be overinterpreted by the markets notwithstanding the rationality of President Lacker's position.  But move forward to both better communication and better state contingency if respect, I and maybe ask Governor Yellen and her subcommittee to look not only at the points that she raised about the use of these projections internally and about various ways disclosure process, but more broadly can put before the Committee for further consideration.

we look toward the next meeting-at which we'll be talking looking and reviewing the SEPs from both January and March-to principal statements at least alternative hypothetical statements that might allow would be broad enough in some sense to capture the I'd also like the staff as about rules, and we'll be consider if not for some state-contingent approach but

I would Lacker's and President Lockhart's views as going back to the March Chairman Dudley opposed that.  I don't have about it.  Is there anyone who would like to comment on that?

you said it is possible policy isn't so exceptionally accommodative as we thought, are we not growing faster?  And then you turned you said as there's a lot of confusion you're supporting keeping in the statement, and we may be leading people to a MR. LOCKHART.  I'd like to pose a question to the Vice Chairman.  At the beginning of your statement and that if it's highly accommodative, why around and supported keeping it in.  I was interpreting what around words that

MR. LOCKHART.  This is forward looking?  This is intentional as opposed to the state of policy now?

as the fact that exceptionally low through late 2014, implies that we think we're going to as we think it is.  That's all.  Our intention is certainly to follow an policy. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think the SEP and the statement, as well we're keeping the rates be keeping policy very accommodative through that period.  All I'm saying is it might not be quite as accommodative accommodative monetary

I think inclusion of this can be open a Pandora's box of interpretation that we MR. LOCKHART.  I'd simply make the point that interpreted in a lot of different ways, and we may don't intend.

paragraph 2 is supposed to provide the paragraph 3, and this is essentially saying that our forecast of pickup is it's logical, but there may be other reasons to on that issue? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Only the logic that rationale for the action of conditional on accommodative monetary.  I think oppose it.  I'm happy to take a straw poll on this, but any other comments going to be affected temporarily.  You can paragraph 2. MR. LACKER.  Well, that goes for everything in paragraph 2.

CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  That's fair. VICE

Bear with me on that.  Let's drop the 'supported CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right. by highly accommodative monetary policy.'

MR. TARULLO.  I'm sorry.  But, Mr. Chairman?

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes, Governor.

MR. TARULLO.

You're going to revert back to the March language?

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No.  Do you want to revert back to the March language?

My issue is that I see the ambiguity in the 'highly accommodative I actually saw ambiguity in the 'remain moderate over coming quarters MR. TARULLO. monetary policy,' but and then to pick up gradually.'

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That's kind of in the SEP.

MR. TARULLO.  Okay.

Today there interested, there will be a screen set up in the Special we're done here in a minute, and then lunch as well for those who are hanging around.

We sent out a calendar.  We received calendar is that it is now strictly quarterly. conferences will be strictly quarterly, and I think that's advantageous. Let me make one more business comment here. some comments on that.  The main feature of this We're dropping the concern about trying to match it up to the Humphrey-Hawkins testimonies, and that has the advantage of more regular meetings, but also, in particular, the four SEPs and four press corresponding to the meetings.  A couple of participants have asked whether we could allow for additional discussion and leave more perhaps assure that every meeting is an 'active meeting' where policy needed.  I don't know if discussion of this now is appropriate, but we The calendar that was sent out had four two-day meetings-ones SEP-and four one-day consider having all eight meetings be two days to time for deliberation and actions could be taken if would certainly be interested in getting views on that subject.  Is that all right?  Let me bring this up as a possibility.

Just for my interest-and recognizing this is unfair, you can change people would like to have 11, 12.  All right. for more considered opinions, and we'll try to resolve this soon.  President Bullard.

If we're going to do this, I'd prefer to start in a calendar year MR. BULLARD.  Mr. Chairman, the revised schedule for this year conflicted with boards of directors' meetings. where we can make all of those adjustments in a normal way.

you would submit that comment to Debbie, we'll CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  If certainly try to accommodate everybody.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Coffee is available.
