CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I  think  ll f  you  are ware  that  ynn Fox is rying  o a o a L t t step nto oe  Coyne's hoes,   task he  is truggling th  successfully,  ope.  We  welcome you  to i J s a s s wi I  h your  first eting. me

Peter isher,  ould  you  take ver  please? F w o

MR.  FISHER.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. I  will e  referring    the b to package  of olor  harts  hat hould e  on  the able  efore  ou.1/  The first ge c c t s b t b y pa shows the  3-month  deposit  ates  ncluding e  current  ibor,  he  3-month r i th L t forward,  nd  the -month  forward ates. a 9 r

Looking  at  the .S.  panel,  ou can  see  that  here  as  been  little  t hange U y t h ne c in  these orward ates  ince our  last  eeting n March 31,  but here  as  been  a f r s y m o t h

very  modest  uptrend ince he onfarm  payroll  elease  April ,  when s t n r on 3 forward  expectations oughed. o,  we have  seen  a  gently  ising  rend  ince tr S r t s early  pril,  ith  a  punctuation  ark  associated th  the pril 7 Wall Street A w m wi A 2 Journal  tory. s

Looking  at  the anel or ermany,  you can  see  that  orward ates  ad  been p f G f r h drifting    at he ime  of  your  last  eeting  and  they id ot tabilize  til  fter up t t m d n s un a the  EU summit on  May  1-3  at  which  the resident d  the  board  of he p an t European  Central  ank were  selected.  hat  pattern  s ontrary  o he B T i c t t expectations   many observers  n  the arket.  I  think  he arlier drift s of i m t e up wa the  consequence  of he ame factors  hat    have  been  talking  bout or ome t s t I a f s months.  These  include  he erception  f  slightly  ronger-than-anticipated t p o st growth  in  the erman  and  other uropean  economies  that  as  been  viewed  as G E h leading  o  a  slightly  gher robability  at  he undesbank  might  raise  ates t hi p th t B r before ear-end r  that  he CB  might  establish  slightly gher  pening  rate y o t E a hi o next anuary han  previously  ad  been  assumed. J t h

The  Japanese ates  re  shown in  the ottom  panel. ou can  see  that  he r a b Y t announcement  of  the  stimulus  ackage  on  April   and  the  foreign  xchange p 9 e intervention   April   and 10 had  little  pact n  the  forward ates, th  the on 9 im o r wi 9-month  forward  3-month  rate  ot oving at  all n  the nnouncement.  I  think n m o a that s orthy  of ote.  However,  on  May  7  Deputy  Governor  Yamaguchi of  the i w n Bank of  Japan  commented that  e  saw more positive an egative  ffects om h th n e fr a  rate  eduction, d  forward ates  oved down a  bit  ollowing  is emarks. r an r m f h r

Turning  to  the ext age,  I  hope  the ommittee  will ind t  orthwhile o n p C f i w t bear  with  me while   try o o  through  some of he  different  mponents  and I t g t co ways of  thinking  bout he apan  premium. I  think  his  xplanation  ight e a t J t e m b helpful  ow.  I  will irst  over  the echanics  of he  top hree  harts, d  then n f go m t t c an discuss  ome issues  nd  problems  that  ome up. Let  me say  in  advance  that s a c I am presenting  his  o  show you  how  skeptical  am that  e really  nderstand t t I w u the  Japan  premium phenomenon.

The first  nel hows a  measure  of  the remium in  dollar  erms.  It s pa s p t i expressed  s  the pread etween  the ank of okyo-Mitsubishi's  month a s b B T 1Libor ate  nd  Barclay's month  Libor  rate.  ou can  see  that  uring he irst r a 1Y d t f quarter  f he  year,  rom  the  start  he ear o he  end  of he apanese iscal o t f oft y t t t J f year  which  also as the  date f  your  last  eeting,  he remium averaged w o m t p around  20  basis oints, ough  it  oved around  a  bit.  hat  is he easure  of p th m T t m the  premium that  ost  people ere  talking  bout.  Since  the nd  of apan's m w a e J fiscal  ear,  t  as  moved down into he  to  10 basis oint ange. y i h t 9 p r

The second  panel  with  the reen  line  s   crude,  ut   think  till eful, g i a b I s us measure  of he  premium in  yen terms, hich  is xpressed  s  the pread etween t w e a s b 1-month  Tibor nd  1-month  Libor. ibor s he  Tokyo interbank  ffer  ate; a T i t o r Libor  is he ondon rate.  he Tokyo panel  is ade up almost xclusively t L T m e of

Japanese anks.  If ou  threw  out he igh  and  the ow in  that  anel,  ou b y t h l p y probably ould  eliminate  he  1  or  2  western anks  that  re n  it,  o  it  ould w t b a i s w become an  exclusively panese anel.  Libor s verwhelmingly on-Japanese. Ja p i o n If ou  threw  out ore of he ighs  and  the  lows, ou would  end  up  throwing y m t h y out  all he apanese ames that  sually  perate  n ibor. ou would end  up t J n u o i L Y with  a  measure  of  1-month  yen  funding omprised ainly f on-Japanese c m o n banks  in ondon and  Japanese anks  in  Tokyo. That  spread  s mportant  o L b i i t underscore  ecause  it  ives ou a  sense f  the remium for he est apanese b g y o p t b J names. It overs nly  the  banks  that  veryone  thinks  re mplicitly  aranteed c o e a i gu by  the overnment, ot  the maller  ore anonymous banks. g n s m

The left-hand ale f  the hird  anel  measures  the sset  ide f he  Bank of sc o t p a s o t Japan's  alance heet. he  shaded  blue  area epicts  he rowth  of ssets.  he b s T d t g a T right-hand  cale efers  o  interest  tes.  he blue ine  s he  overnight  all  ate; s r t ra T l i t c r it ecently  as  been  mostly elow  the olid  lack ine,  hich  is he  official r h b s b l w t discount  ate. r

Let  me now go  back  over ome of he ssues  hat  ome up.  First,    s orth s t i t c it i w noting hat  oth  the  dollar  nd  the en  premiums have  come down quite    bit  n t b a y a i recent  ays.  It s uite  oticeable at  he ollar  easure  still  dicates d i q n th t d m in a premium in  the   to  10  basis  oint  ange.  One might  ask  whether his  remium 9 p r t p should e arbitraged t; t ught o  be  an  easy  thing  o  arbitrage ay. But, f b ou i o t t aw o course,  n  investor uld  have  to  take n the redit  isk  mplicit    doing a wo o c r i in business  ith  Japanese ames. What interests   is hat  hen I  talk  o w n me t w t bankers,  any of hem will  ell  e very  frankly  hat  heir  redit  ines  o  their m t t m t t c l t Japanese ounterparties  e  completely ull.  hat  is,  heir  raders e  taking c ar f T t t ar maximum  advantage  of rying  o  capture  his  remium and  arbitrage .  ut  the t t t p it B bank  credit  epartments  re  now in  charge n  an individual ade-by-trade d a o tr basis,  nd  they re  up  against  heir  imits. th that  n  mind,  I  find t uite a a t l Wi i i q impressive  hat  he  spread s till  ly  9  to  10  basis  oints--that n  with  greed t t i s on p eve restrained    credit  epartments, e pread s till    that  eighborhood. by d th s i s in n

If ou  look  at  the en  measure, ou  can  see hat he remium has  been y y y t t p squeezed  down to  1  or  2 basis  oints  t resent.    believe  t  s mportant  or s p a p I i i i f u to  ask  whether e are  looking t   single  henomenon that  e can  measure w a a p w consistently  om  last  all.  hen  we talk  o  Bank of  Japan  officials, y oint fr f W t the p to  what  they all  he win  peaks  of he remium--one  prior  o  the alendar  earc t t t p t c y end  and  the ther rior  o  the iscal ar-end. hey view  the remium o p t f ye T p principally    a  liquidity  sk, t  as  a  credit sk.    would  note,  owever, hat as ri no ri I h t the  first ak  occurred n  late  ovember when we began  to ee  closures  f pe i N s o Japanese inancial stitutions,  nging  o  mind a  larger  uestion  f redit  isk. f in bri t q o c r Also, iven  the  dubious uality  f ssets  n  the alance heets  f apanese g q o a o b s o J banks, his  oes  not  seem to  be  a  very seful  ime o  be  drawing  a  fine t d u t t distinction  tween  liquidity  d  credit  isks.   Japanese ank  that  annot be an r A b c fund  itself   eally    credit sk  o e if    am a  market ounterparty. isr a ri t m I c

The third  anel hows the  growth  in  the ank of apan's  ssets.  n  our p s B J a I conversations,  nk of apan  officials  plained  hat  they ere  trying  o Ba J ex w w t accomplish  when they  were  aggressively panding heir  alance heet round ex t b s a calendar  ear-end nd  fiscal  ear-end.  y doing  so  through -month  repos, y a y B 1 they anted  to  provide  he  market  with  a  sense f onfidence  y  injecting w t o c b liquidity  r   relatively  ng  period. he growth  of he sset  ide f heir fo a lo T t a s o t balance heet epicted  hat.  hey are ather  efensive  bout  the  low  growth  on s d t T r d a the  liability e f heir  alance heet  ecause  they ay  that  arious  easures sid o t b s b s v m they  have  been  publishing  or    long ime  are isleading.  hey actually ve f a t m T ha been  draining  eserves  t imes y  issuing  heir  wn bills.  hat  is,  hey ssue r a t b t o T t i their  wn liability  one  side s  a  Bank of apan  bill, t hey lso rain o on a J bu t a d reserves.  hat  is   swap on  the iability e nd  not eally  rowth  in he T a l sid a r g t balance heet. n  any  case,  hese ransactions  ve  not iven  me much s I t t ha g confidence.

I  will ffer  ou  my own interpretation,  words  not  theirs.  t eems  to  me o y my I s that  or he  last x r  seven  months,  they ave  been  doing omething f n f t si o h s o a "operation  wist"  t he ery  short nd  of heir  ield  urve. hey have  been t a t v e t y c T intervening   the  1-month  interest  te rea,  ushing oney out. hen, in ra a p m T because  they  target e  call  ate  nd  try o eep  it n  the eighborhood f he th r a t k i n o t overnight  iscount  ate,  hey ave  been  draining  unds  out f he  shorter  nd-d r t h f o t e overnight  nd  for wo  or hree ays  at  a  time--against  e ackdrop  of he a t t d th b t overall  xpansion f heir  alance heet. hat  leads e to he  tentative e o t b s T m t conclusion  hat  hen I  look t he en  funding remium,  I  am not easuring  a t w a t y p m single  onsistent  enomenon expressed  n  the  demand side. hat's  ecause, c ph o T b overall, ere as  been  a  net ncrease  n  the upply  side f he oney market. th h i o s o t m But  at he argin, t  akes me even  more  nervous o  think  hat hey eally  ave t m i m t t t r h been  price-targeting    1-month  interest  te  o  push  it  own while  draining the ra t d funds  out  overnight  o ry o eep  the vernight  all  ate lose o  the  overnight t t t k o c r c t discount  ate. f   am right  bout  that, en nterpreting   premium is ven r I I a th i the e more complicated  han  I hought.   believe  he  risks  f  sudden  backup  going t t I t o a forward,  f  here  s ad  news,  are ven  greater. i t i b e

The bottom  panel  is   place older  o  show you  widening orporate  preads, a h t c s expressed  n  some Moody's indices  hat  e found, ver omparable apanese i t w o c J government  securities.  hink his  anel  is nteresting  r hree  easons. irst, I  t t p i fo t r F many people  talk  bout he  fact  hat hey annot ind eteriorating dit a t t t c f d cre spreads n  markets n  Japan.  They suggest  hat  apanese arkets o  not  work i i t J m d that  ay,  that  hey  are ot estern, ut  we can  see he  deterioration te w t n W b t qui clearly  n his  hart.  econdly,  hese idening preads  re  those f he anks' i t c S t w s a o t b customers,  nd  things  re etting  orse  and  worse  for hem.  Finally, hink  t a a g w t I  t i is   useful  eminder hat  e are pproaching he  Japanese ankruptcy eason. a r t w a t b s The  bankruptcies   not  actually cur t  the nd of he  fiscal ar; hey ake do oc a e t ye t t place ater en the  fiscal  ear esults ve to  be  made public. uch  the  same l wh y r ha M thing appened  in  November  of ast  ear hen we began  seeing eports  f h l y w r o

bankruptcies lating   results   the iscal  alf  ear hat nded  September  30, re to in f h y t e 1997.

Turning  to  the ext age, et e briefly te  some of he  dollar's n p l m no t movements. You can  see  in  the  top anel  that  he apanese overnment p t J g stimulus  ackage  did  little   mprove  market entiment  oward  the en, nd p toi s t y a perhaps he indest  hing ne  can  say  about he t k t o t of  intervention they  carried  ut  on  April  and  10  is hat  t  ad  only  a  transitory ect   the o 9 t i h eff on exchange  rate.  ver  the ast  onth,  many market  participants e  been  full  f O l m hav o brave  talk  bout  dollar/yen ing  to  150  and  160.  When  we ask  them  why it s a go i not here lready,  hey xpress    strong  onviction  ut hey o  not  make a  very t a t e a c b t d persuasive  ase.  Even so, ince he lose f he -8 summit  this  eekend and c s t c o t G w the  absence f ompelling alk  bout ntervention,  en  has  been  weakening o c t a i they against  he ollar  or he  last  wo  days, umping up  through hat  the arket t d f t t b w m thought  as the ery  significant  5 level. w v 13

On the  mark side,  or ll he ireworks  nvolving  he ersonalities he f a t f i t p at  t EMU summit  on  May  1-3,   think  ne  should ot  ignore  hat  he ummit  did I o n t t s make a  certainty  t  of MU ou E when previously  here as at east   one-in-at w l a hundred hance  that  he rocess  ould  be  delayed r  derailed. e  removal  of c t p w o Th that ncertainty s  made the ark rather  ore significant  the redecessor u ha m m as p of the  euro.  We  can  see  some slight rming  f he  mark.  But  overall, cept or fi o t ex f the  slight trend f he  dollar  gainst  he  yen  since ebruary , hat  impresses up o t a t F 1 w me about  this  anel s ow very  little  s  happened  to  the ollar  n  1998. We p i h ha d i have  had  shifting pectations garding  ommittee  policy,  harp luctuations ex re C s f in  equity  arkets,  rises  n outheast  sia  and  in  the orld's  econd  largest m c i S A w s economy,  and  an  historic netary  union  in  Europe.  Taking  a  step ack, his mo b t panel  suggests  o  me that  he ollar  as  been  out n  a  Sunday  stroll. t t d h o

In  the ottom  panel, ou  can  see hat  reasury ields  ave  tracked  he b y t T y h t movements in  short-term pectations own in  the  upper  panel f he irst ex sh o t f page  of hese harts.  hese  yields  ave  changed  very  little    net ince he ate t c T h on s t d of  your  last  eeting,  ut here  as  been  a  gentle  ptick  ince  he onfarm m b t h u s t n payroll  elease  n April . I  have  talked  o  a  number  of raders  nd  speculators r o 3 t t a who complain  rather  oudly hat  here  s ot nough  volatility  this  arket  for l t t i n e in m them  to  make money.

Let  me turn o  our pen  market  operations   the ext age  and  give ou an t o on n p y update n the  tax  inflows  n pril nd  May.  In  the op  panel,  ou can  see  that o i A a t y the  Board  and  New  York  staff recasts r econd-quarter  ceipts nverged fo fo s re co at he igher evel,  loser  o  the ew  York  numbers.  In  the  chart  elow,  you t h l c t N b can  see hat  his id ot  help ew  York very  much in  forecasting  e  daily t t d n N th reserve  evels.  s the ed ine hows,  the  actual  alance ame in  much closer l A r l s b c to  the oard's stimate  han o  New  York's,  hich is   good  lesson n  the B e t t w a i difficulties  aking  daily  orecasts. of  m f

The first ason or his  s  that  eceipts d  not ome in  as  strong r  as  early re f t i r di c o as  the taff   New  York was forecasting.  is  is ndicated   the irst tation s in Th i in f no line t he  bottom  of he  page.  The  first w of umbers, hich  shows  total a t t ro n w actual  reasury alances ess  he ew  York  forecast,  dicates w far  he T b l t N in ho t actuals  ame in  below  our  daily orecasts,  rticularly ly  n. But  the ap c f pa ear o g narrowed  quite   bit  s  we got nto ate  pril nd  early  ay. a a i l A a M

The second  reason hy it as so  difficult  forecast e  day  number is hat w w to h t on  April 7 the reasury nnounced  some changes  to he T&amp;L  program  that 1 T a t T were  designed o  make it  ore attractive   anks.  While  we had  been  working t m tob with  them  on  this  nd  are ery  supportive  f hese hanges, he iming f heir a v o t c t t o t announcement  frankly  ook s, he arket, nd  the  Treasury's n  forecasters t u t m a ow by  surprise.  you can  see, he otations   the  bottom  row show how much As t n in this  ffected r  own day  numbers  by  indicating  e xtent  o hich the  TT&amp;L a ou th e t w accounts ere holding igher alances  han  we were  forecasting,  aning w h b t me lower  balances  t he eserve  Banks. a t R

The next  page  shows various  ndicators  rading  ctivity    the ed  funds i oft a in f market  since our  last  eeting.  The vertical ue ines  re he aily  anges f y m bl l a t d r o the  federal  unds ates; e  horizontal d  lines  r  ticks  re  the ffective f r th re o a e averages or ach  trading  ay, nd  the ertical d  lines  ach  represent e f e d a v re e on standard  eviation  f  trading  round  the aily  ffective  tes.  he increase  n d o a d e ra T i TT&amp;L  balances  t  major  banks  may have  been  one  of he actors ntributing a t f co to  the oftness  n he unds arket  in  the  middle wo  maintenance eriods;  he s i t f m t p t increase  ubstantially uced ather  uddenly he urchasing  eeds  of ome of s red r s t p n s the  major  banks  that ften  re  active  n  the orning.  More importantly, o a i m demand for  excess eserves  ppears  o  have  shifted wer,  articularly ing r a t lo p dur the  April 2  and  May  6  maintenance eriods,  development hat  e do  not et 2 p a t w y fully  nderstand.  oreover,  banks  apparently  ere  able o  use  positive rryu M w t ca ins rom  the  April 2 period nto he  May  6  period  o   much greater  xtent f 2 i t t a e than  we previously  iewed  as  the orm. That  may be  the esult   little  re v n r of mo than  a  random distributive ect  r  it  ay be  something ore  profound;  e do eff o m m w not  yet now. k

The softness  n  the unds  market  in he ay  6  period,  think  n  looking i f t M I i back, eflected  combination f  this  pparent hift   demand for xcess r a o a s in e reserves  nd  our  desire  o  remain  symmetric ith  respect  o he isks  n  each a t w t t r o day.  To put  this  omewhat more precisely,  en  as  we became aware  that  ank s ev b demand for xcess eserves  as lower  than  we had  expected,  e were  reluctant e r w w to  pare ack  the umulatively  igher  xcess eserves  ecause  to ave  done  so b c h e r b h would  have  required  iming  for uite   low  daily  xcess umber.  Moreover, a q a e n this  ould  have  occurred t   time  when the bsolutely gh  level  f reasury w a a a hi o T balances t  the ed  meant  that    small ercentage  oint iss  in he reasury a F a p p m t T balance stimate  ould  have  completely rained  he unds  market  and  left  s e c d t f u with  a  very egative  ay  number and  a  big  surprise   the pside. owever, n d on u H based  on  this  xperience,  revised  own our  assumption bout  period e we d a

MR.  FISHER.  Noon is ather  ate  n  the  cycle f  daily  rading  nd  clearing   the r l i o t a in market.  The book  entry ide f he ire  closes  t  3:00 .m.  We  want  to ry o  provide ome s o t w a p t t s elasticity  both  the rading  nd  the learance  unctions   most  major  firms.  noon  auction to t a c f of A would  enable hem  to  get  their sults ound  12:30 .m., nd  that  s lready    little  te  n he ay. t re ar p a i a a la i t d How  we would respond n  a  period f  acute tress  s,    think,  good  question.    would  emphasize i o s i I a I that  f  he arket  knew securities  re  to  be  auctioned  t oon  and  they ould  look orward o i t m we a n c f t relying  n that  uction n  days  of ome stress, at ight  help o  comfort hem.  Beyond that  e o a o s th m t t w have  considered  wo  possible  pproaches. ne might  be  to  announce  early  n  the orning  a  change t a O i m in  the imits  or he  noon auction,  hich  might  provide ome additional mfort.

MR.  FISHER.  Obviously,  f  e state  he  problem  in  the xtreme  form  of arket i w t e m failure,    s ard o  point  o  a  market ailure. at I  would  emphasize  is hat  e rely  n  the ery it i h t t f Wh t w o v smooth  operation  f his  arket  because t  s he ehicle  or ur  principal licy  ool.   think hat  s o t m i i t v f o po t I t i why,  in  looking ack  through ears nd  years f  memoranda and  reports  n  this  ssue,  see  a b y a o o i we consistent  ncern  from  the ed's  oint f iew  about  making  this  arket  work  efficiently. co F p o v m A number of  central  anks  do  not ely s  much as  we do,  almost xclusively,    our  own government b r a e on debt  to omprise he sset  ide f ur  balance heet. e  are  the hog"  of  the overnment  securities c t a s o o s W " g market.

So,  it  s n 15, o is a t y c i i our  interest   ake this  arket  function  s  smoothly s  possible. e market  certainly  ews  us  as tom m a a Th vi

MR.  HOENIG. Does it equire  hat ou go  in  on  a  daily  asis  o  provide  his r t y b t t "marginal" elp,  f  hat  s he ight  ord? h i t i t r w

MR. FISHER.  I  would  prefer  hat  e be  predictable d  transparent    the ules t w an in r under  which  we operate. e  thought ong  and  hard bout  trying  o esign  a  more  discretionary W l a t d program  where  we would  just  espond o  dealer  eeds.  But  that  egan  to eel ore like r t n b f m intervention    the  "specials" rket.

But  normally,  e ift w b a D w will  ry  o e  transparent,  edictable,  le-based,  d  let  he arket ome to  us  through   price t t b pr ru an t m c a mechanism.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice  Chairman.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Peter,  ould e go  back  to  your  discussion c w of what  the ank of  Japan  has  been  doing?  I  think  e all  gree hat  hey re  dealing  ith  a  troubled B w a t t a w banking  system. he Bank of apan  now has  a  significant  ount of ank  paper n the  asset  ide T J am b o s of  its  alance heet. o,  if  e had  a  bank  failure   Japan, ne  of he nteresting ngs  hat  ould b s S w in o t i thi t w happen  is hat    fair  it f aper rom  the ank  that  ollapsed  ould  be  in  the sset  tructure  he t a b o p f b c w a s oft Bank of  Japan.

MR.  FISHER.  Yes,  that  s nother  eature    did ot ention.  You can  see  that  n i a f I n m i their  alance heet.    don't  ave  the igures  n ront  f  me,  and  I'm ot  sure t  s n  overwhelming b s I h f i f o n i i a number. But,  yes, here as  been  a  certain  mount  of redit  ubstitution t  he ank of apan  has t h a c s tha t B J

arranged  argely l by issuing  ts  wn bills ile  it  as  added  reserves  rincipally taking  n  private i o wh h p by i paper  as  well  as  government  securities.  hould ot  say  "principally taking  n  private per." I s n by i pa They have  been  taking  n  a  fair  mount of uch  paper n  addition  o apanese overnment  bonds. i a s i t J g So,  they  have  ended  up  with  more  customer r  bank  paper n  their  alance heet nd  have  put  out o o b s a their  wn credit  nto  he arket. o i t m A number of  traders   Tokyo have  noted  that  t  eemed  to  them in i s that  he  Bank of apan  was caught n  a  dilemma.  Having  taken n rivate  aper,  f  hey  disgorge  t t J i i p p i t i now, very  strange  hings  ay happen  to  the  prices  nd  yields  hat  rivate tities   apan  get  on t m a t p en inJ such  paper.

MR. TRUMAN. Isn't is  ne  instance, esident  cDonough, where  that  ank th o Pr M b paper  is overed c by the  implicit arantee  f  the overnment? Actually, e  Bank of apan  itself gu o g th J has  substantial  ofits,    think t ould bsorb izable  osses.  he first  course  ight  be  that  f pr so I i c a s l T re m i a bank  failed, e reditors  uld  be  made whole th c wo by the  government, s  has  happened  in  all he ther a t o bank  failures,  d  then he ank of apan  would be  made whole,  too. an t B J

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. My policy  roblem  is hat,  ince hey  seem  to p t s t have  fully  efloated e onvoy  system  with r th c 19 banks  now limping long n  the onvoy,  part  f he a i c o t fuel n  each  of he hips urrently   supplied i t s c is by the  Bank of apan.  Even though  the ank could J B absorb he  shock  financially, s  s nother  eason hy they  would  be  inclined  o ay, f  he t thi i a r w t s i t condition  f ne  of hose anks  did ot  look  so  good,  that  hey id  not ant  the dditional  blic o o t b n t d w a pu disgrace  f cknowledging  a  write-off    their  alance heet. hey would  therefore nt  to eep o a on b s T wa k the  bank  afloat, ich is   further ep n  the irection  ot esolving e  problems  in  their wh a st i d ofn r th banking  system.

MR.  FISHER. I don't  ave  any  evidence f his  ther  han  anecdotes  n  the arket, h o t o t i m but  the mpression  n  the arket  is hat  he rivate  aper he ank of apan  is aking  n  is ot  of he i i m t t p p t B J t i n t

top  18 banks  but f he  lower  tiers.  s I  see  it, is  akes it   slightly  gger  roblem.  The Bank o t A th m a bi p of apan  may have  an  implicit arantee or he hole  financial ctor.  e  may yet  get  a  financial J gu f t w se W shock  there,  ut  I  hink t  s ore likely   come from  the  hinterlands,  it  ere. b t i i m to as w

MR.  PRELL.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. I  might  call our  attention    the y to housing ata  that  ere  put  at our  places  his  orning.  I  won't  o  into  hat  t d w y t m g t a any  length.  et  me just  ay  that  he ingle-family  using tarts d  permits L s t s ho s an data ere very  close o  our xpectations,  ile he ultifamily  tarts re  on w t e wh t m s we the  low  side nd  really rprisingly  w  given  the rend  n  permits.  ultifamily a su lo t i M starts e  of  lesser portance n  dollar  erms,  nd  we would also xpect o  see ar im i t a e t some bounceback.  So,  on  the hole,  I  think hese ata o  not epresent w t d d r a significant  parture  rom  what  we had  in  the reenbook  for esidential de f G r construction  tivity. ac

We  have  seen  some astonishing onomic  data ince he  last  eeting,  nd ec s t m a we have  worked  hard  to  make sense f hem.  In  the nd, hat  we have o t e w

For  some of  you,  the entral  uestion  robably s ow we could  have c q p i h looked  at   first-quarter    increase  hat  e now estimate  t ore than  5 a GDP t w a m percent,  long  with pril's 1/4 ercent  obless  ate,  nd  still t  have  come a A 4p j r a no up with  a  scarier ice  orecast.  will ocus y remarks  on  that  uestion, th pr f I f m q wi the  expectation  hat    will  nd  up  addressing  ome of our ther  oncerns long t I e s y o c a the  way.

First, ere  s o  doubt  about  it:  he  first arter  as a  stunner.  s you th i n T qu w A may recall, id  say  at  the ast  eeting hat  t  ould  not e  a  shock  to ee  the I  d l m t i w b s forthcoming xpenditure  ata ome in  strong  nough  to  push  the DP  growth e d c e G rate    point  r wo above  our  3  percent  rediction. t, t he ime,  e knew a o t p Bu a t t w only  about he  huge  increases  n ayrolls  n anuary nd  February;    would t i p i J a I have  been  more  conservative   e had  known that  mployment had  declined  n ifw e i March.

In  any  event,  he ncoming  spending ata rior  o he pril 0  release  f t i d p t t A 3 o BEA's advance  estimate  eally  id ot  prepare  s  for   GDP  number as  high  as r d n u a the .2  percent  hey ublished.  he major  surprise s their  ig  inventory 4 t p T wa b component. It as not  a matter  f heir  riting  own a  questionably gh  set f w o t w d hi o assumptions or he  missing arch data. hey did  not.  Instead,   as mainly f t M T itw the  translation   he vailable ok-value ata or anuary nd  February nto oft a bo d f J a i real  erms.  We  talked  ith  the EA  staff o did  the alculations,   we t w B wh c and could  not  find ny  flaws n  their  ethods. a i m

That  said,  hough, 67 billion  onfarm  inventory  nvestment  till oked t $ ofn i s lo awfully arge o  us, oming  as  it  id n  the eels f   similarly gh  rate  f l t c d o h o a hi o accumulation  n  the ourth  uarter.  t eemed  odd  that  tocks ould e  piling i f q I s s c b up so  much more  rapidly  han inal  ales ithout ur  hearing  ore reports  hat t f s w o m t firms ere  concerned bout xcess nventories. w a e i

But  while  I'm n  the  subject  f roductivity  havior, t  e take his o o p be le m t opportunity  o  segue  to  another  onjectural  pect f ur orecast, mely  the t c as o o f na revised  roductivity  end. ased  on  a  review f ecent  evelopments nd  of p tr B o r d a the  newly  available ta n  multifactor  oductivity  rough  1996,  we have da o pr th raised  ur  assumption egarding  he rend rowth  of  output er our  in  the o r t t g p h nonfarm  business  ector  y  a  quarter  ercentage  oint  er nnum. This  might s b p p p a not  sound  like  uch, but t  s ignificant  offsetting  e urprise  have  had m i i s in th s we with  respect  o he nemployment rate. t rovides  n  offset   two  ways:  It t t u I p a in mutes  the ffect  f  a  higher DP  path n the nemployment  rate,  nd  it  lso e o G o u a a means that    given  rate  f ompensation ain ranslates  to    smaller a o c g t in a increment n  standardized it abor osts.  his  helps o  explain  hy,  despite i un l c T t w the  recent  urprises,  e nemployment rate  s nly  a  hair  ower  by  next ear s th u i o l y than  in  the ast  orecast  nd  why we have  not aised  he nflation  recast. l f a r t i fo

Of  course,  e not  only ave  not aised  ur nflation  recast,   actually w h r o i fo we have  trimmed  it    tenth.  his uts s  more clearly  elow  the onsensus, a T p u b c although    am not  sure ow many of he rivate  orecasters  e eing  as I h t p f ar b assiduous  s  we are  about eeping rack  f he  damping effects  he  ongoing a k t o t oft BLS  technical  evisions   the PI.

First,    the ompensation  side,  e have  absolutely   doubt hat  he abor on c w no t t l market  is xtremely aut.  e  are  a  bit  keptical out he  4-1/4 ercent e t W s ab t p unemployment  rate  egistered    the urvey ast  onth,  but  whatever he rue r in s l m t t number is,  e are  sure hat  orkers  have  gained ome clout  n  the ay-setting w t w s i p process. onetheless,  he arch ECI figures  howed wage and  salary N t M s increases  ight  n  line  ith ur  expectations d  benefit st ncreases low r i w o an co i be our  guess.  Thus, here  as nothing  n  that  eport  o egate he  basic remises t w i r t n t p of  our orecast  f  flat  ominal  compensation nflation:  mely,  that  ow  price f o n i na l inflation  ll  amp wage increases; at  here  ill e  no  repetition   he wi d th t w b oft minimum  wage hikes hat  oosted ay  rates  n  the  past ouple f  years;  nd t b p i c o a that,  hough  health nsurance  osts  ill e  increasing re rapidly,  slowing f t i c w b mo a o the  economic  expansion ill ake ome of  the  "oomph" out  of ommissions  and w t s c bonuses.  Time will ell  hether his  anguine ssessment s ight, t  we are t w t s a i r bu sticking th  it or ow. wi f n

On the  price  ide,  he ncoming  data ave  been  close o ur xpectations, s t i h t o e though  we can  find ome reasons  o  worry:  The tobacco rice  ncreases ep s t p i ke coming at  us, nd  we have  not  incorporated  legislative ion  hat  ight  lead a a act t m to  much steeper  ncrements  han  we have  been  seeing f  late.  he  0.4 ercent i t o T p jump in  owners'  equivalent nt n  last  onth's PI  could  be  a  harbinger  f re i m C o a more adverse rend n  a  stronger using arket.  And there re  signs f  price t i ho m a o increases  appening lsewhere,  oo.. h e t

But,  against  hat  onsideration,   must  also eigh  the ontinued t c one w c indications   softness  n  prices  n any sectors--the  ck f pricing  everage" of i i m la o " l still    widely eported, pecially    goods  markets. he fact  s hat  here re so r es in T i t t a substantial  gments  of he  economy where  prices  re  going  nowhere  or se t a downward because  there  s lack ndustrial  pacity, tense  mport i s i ca in i competition,  eregulation,  st-saving chnological vances,  nd  so  on. d co te ad a Commodity prices  learly  re ot  signaling   upturn  in  inflation.    fact, l c a n an In oi companies  will ell  ou  of  a  supply-demand icture at  eaves hem  concerned t y p th l t that  rices  ight  go  down from  here.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions or ike?  President  arry. f M P

MR. PARRY. I  have  two  questions  bout our  forecast,  e  about our ew estimate a y on y n of  the  trend  rowth  of roductivity  d  the ther  bout he  outlook or  nventories. uld  you  say g p an o a t f i Co something  about he  educational  nd  job  experience  omposition ata hat  ere  referred   in t a c d t w to Monday's  briefing  y  the  Board  staff d  also n  the reenbook?

MR.  PRELL.  I  think  he nalysis  s   little  re complicated  han hat, d  I  will t a i a mo t t an spare ou  some of he  details.  would  probably tumble ver  them  in  any  event. e  have  been y t I s o W building  nto ur  forecast  substantial  lowance or   positive fect  n productivity  om  capital i o a al f a ef o fr deepening.  We  did ot ave  a  set f umbers that  as as  up-to-date   we would  have  liked, d n h o n w as an the  recent  tatistical  ease  as  clarified  at  icture.  hat we found  was  that  he roductivity s rel h th p W t p effects  n  the apital  eepening ide robably  ere  not  as  large  s  we had  estimated  arlier,   yet o c d s p w a e and we also  saw more favorable  ata n other omponents  of he  productivity  cture. d o c t pi

One of  them  was a  step-up  n he ate f mprovement  in  labor  uality.  hat  always i t r o i q T seemed  to  be  a  possibility.  know  that  ollege  nrollments  ave  been  increasing.   have  seen We c e h We recently  ome increase  n  participation ng older,  ore experienced  orkers.  Whether such s i amo m w workers  are  truly  s  productive  s  one  might  assume  on  the  basis  f heir perience  s onjectural, a a o t ex i c given  the hanges  in  technology  nd  other  nnovations. t  looking t he  compositional anges c a i Bu a t ch in  the orkforce nd  the  influx  f ecent  ollege  raduates  ho may have  more current  kills w a o r c g w s in terms  of  what  employers  are ooking or,  t  eemed  reasonable  o  us  to xtrapolate  at  ecent l f i s t e th r improvement  in  our  forecast.

So,  taking ur nvestment  orecast,  tending hat  we have  learned  bout  the apital o i f ex w a c services  ontribution,  trapolating    a  sensible y in ight  f ecent  abor  arkets evelopments c ex in wa l o r l m d the  information  e have  on  the uality  f abor temming  from  greater ucation,  concluded w q o l s ed we that  t  as  reasonable  o aise  ur  assumption bout  the roductivity  end.  e  triangulated  ainst i w t r o a p tr W ag all he  other  nformation  hat  as available--the tinuing  urprises   the ecent  abor t i t w con s in r l

I  must  say hat  e are ot  alone n  our  estimate  f  a  1-1/2 ercent  roductivity  owth t w n i o p p gr trend.   think RI is here. eople  bringing  ifferent  chnology  o hese stimates  ome up with I D t P d te t t e c different  nclusions,  t  we feel hat  his  s   reasonably  ound  move for s  at his  oint. co bu t t i a s u t p

MR.  PRELL.  I  think    voiced y  concern n  this  egard,  aybe not learly ough. I m i r m c en There  are  a  couple f ossibilities  e. ne is,  s  I  indicated,  at hile e cannot ind   flaw  in o p her O a th w w f a the  data t his  oint,  nventory  nvestment  ay still ve  been  significantly  s  apid  han  the a t p i i m ha les r t first-quarter  bers  currently em to  add  up  to.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President skow. Mo

MR.  MOSKOW. Mike,  I  wanted  to  ask  you  about ne  part f he age side f he o o t w o t forecast.  s you  point ut,  ou  anticipate  at  orkers  will ccept imited  age increases  n  the A o y th w a l w i future  ecause f  low  inflation  d  low  inflation  pectations.   course,  e know that  ages are b o an ex Of w w going  up  now.  We  have  seen  that  n  all he easures,  nd  we are  all etting  necdotal  nformation i t m a g a i about  rising  ages. You point ut  that  orkers  have  more bargaining wer.  You add  in  the act w o w po f that  e have  the echnical anges  in  the onsumer  price  easures, hich  are etting  ignificant w t ch c m w g s in the  CPI going orward.  So,  when we look  at  your  forecast  he  overall  PI going ut o  1999,  it f oft C o t shows  consumer  price  nflation  sing 1  percent  n  a  measured  basis.  f e add  back  in he i ri 2. o I w t technical  djustments,  are p  to  2.8  percent  n  1999. On the  core  CPI, f  e add  in he  effect a we u i i w t of these echnical  hanges,  e see  an acceleration  ch  year s  well.  From the erspective  orker t c w ea a p ofw expectations,  w do  you  plug  in hese echnical anges  to  the PI? ho t t ch C

MR. PRELL.  The process  y  which  price  ovements enter nto  he  determination b m i t of wages is ery  complex. The movements in  the  CPI are   benchmark  in  some collective  rgaining v a ba situations  ere employers re  gauging  an  appropriate y  increase  o  offer  heir ployees  in  the wh a pa t t em hope  that  he orkers  will ot e  so  perturbed  bout here  they tand elative  thers  hat  hey t w n b a w s r too t t will eave. ovements in  the  CPI also erve s  a  benchmark  in  many cases utside  f ollective l M s a o o c bargaining  here  a  one-sided  ecision  as  to e  made. Employers  will  ook  at hat  has  happened w d h b l w to  the ublished  ndex  over he ast ear,  r  some other elevant riod,  nd  make that  n  important p i t p y o r pe a a element n  their  ecision.  n  some cases here  there  re  complex  systems f  general  ase  pay i d I w a o b increases  hat  re  supplemented  y  merit ay  increases  nd  bonuses  and  so  on, hat  irst  ement t a b p a t f el may be  very  much influenced  y  the erception  f hat  has  been  happening o he ost f  living. b p o w t t c o I think  hese ear-by-year anges  that  ou are  talking  bout--you  eferred   the reenbook level  f t y ch y a r to G o CPI  inflation    1999--involve mparisons sing 994 methods.  They are  cumulative  nd in co u 1 a overstate e  differences  om  year o ear. e  are alking  bout  differences   only  .1 r  .2 th fr t y W t a of o percentage  oint or ach  of hese ears. hat  is   subtlety at  robably s issed  in  those  ases p f e t y T a th p i m c where  people re  simply ooking t he  published  PI  to  gauge  what  the ppropriate y  increase a l a t C a pa might  be.  Part f his  rocess s,    think,  imply  a  backward-looking  ne  as  I  described.  t  s o t p i I s o I i a cost-of-living  ch-up, rmal r  informal. cat fo o

There  probably lso s ome influence  rom  expectations  at  ay not  be  entirely a i s f th m backward-looking.  n that  core,  e have  no  evidence hat eople re  expecting    dramatic  ickup O s w t p a a p in  inflation.  e  recent  urvey vidence as  shown a  declining end  n  inflation  pectations, Th s e h tr i ex though  with  some small ptick  n  the ichigan  Survey  last  onth. The expected  evel  f nflation u i M m l o i is ot  down to  the  measured  level f nflation  t. hat  might  suggest  hat  ome people re ot n o i ye T t s a n going  to  conclude hat  f  hey et  a  2 percent  age increase, at  ncrease  s oing  to eep  them t i t g w th i i g k

If e asked  a  number  of eople hat  the  inflation  te w p w ra was in  the ast  ear,    cannot elieve  hat  ost  would  come within   percentage  oints.  his l y I b t m 5 p T Michigan  Survey,  s  best   can  judge,  s sking traight  estions  f eople ithout ny  bias. ven a I i a s qu o p w a E so,   would  be  terribly  rious  o  see hether he esponses  ome close  o  what  the ctual  nflation I cu t w t r c t a i rate  as.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Crude  oil  nd  oil roduct nventories  ve  moved up a p i ha quite ignificantly. s

MR.  POOLE. Right,  hat's  at  I  thought. t wh

In  that  egard,  he nly eally  nteresting tistic t r t o r i sta tha we have  is he  response o   question  e asked he  purchasing  anagers, amely  whether  in  their t t a w t m n judgment  the nventories    manufacturers' stomers ere  too  high, bout ight,   too  low. i of cu w a r or

I o i s an r d pr gather  hat  he ata rom  the ational  ederation  f ndependent  usinesses  NFIB) show much the t t d f N F o I B ( same thing.

MR. PRELL.  Yes.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That  is sually  n  indication  istory  hough. u a ofh t

MR.  PRELL.  It ay be  that  hey re  reflecting  at  has  happened  but,  e  that  s  it m t a wh b a may,  the pril umber took  a  big ump.  It ctually oks  weird.  For  what  it's  rth, o  concern A n j a lo wo n was expressed  here,  nd  in  fact  he  NFIB  survey verall,   interpreted    their  wn people,  ould t a t o as by o w suggest hat  he  growth  of  the conomy in  the econd  quarter  ill e  as  strong  s  it  as in  the irst, t t e s w b a w f and  that id  not  come as  any  surprise  hem. According o  their  urvey, econd-quarter  owth  is d tot t s s gr going  to e  stupendously  trong. b s

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The truth  f he atter s hat nventory  ackups  are o t m i t i b perceived  nly  when final  emand begins o low.  I  think  e almost ever ind necdotal o d t s w n f a inventory  oncerns hen markets re  moving as  fast  s  they  are urrently. c w a a c

MR.  PRELL.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It s he  only ne  that  e have  showing  an  acceleration i t o w in  the econd  quarter. s

MR. PRELL.  The  other oint    want  to ake is hat  t s ot imply  a  question  n  our p I m t i i n s i minds  of hether  this  nventory  uildup s nvoluntary.  s n  large easure  simply  a  question  f w i b i i Iti i m o whether  the nventory  ccumulation  as as  rapid  s  was indicated r he irst rt f  the  year i a w a fo t f pa o because,  ne  way or  another, at  ate  f  inventory  nvestment  eeds  to ome down.

This  productivity  in  was  not mmediately a p tr s up ga i recognized,   employers  might  have  been  able  to et  away with  more moderate ominal  wage so g n

increases,  me of  that  howing  up  in  lower  inflation  d  some of t howing  up  in igher rofits so s an i s h p in the  short  un.  That  process ay be  reversing.  e  are  assuming  a little  ck  ack  up  in he  NAIRU. r m W ti b t Maybe it ill e  more dramatic han  what  we have  allowed or. w b t f

In  the nd, e are  monitoring  he  incoming  data s  closely  s  anyone  can.  As I  said, e w t a a what  we have  seen  in  the ecent  umbers  has  not  been  at dds  with ur  expectations. u can r n o o Yo eyeball  he  moving averages n a  number of hese eries  nd  see  an  upward  drift at  ou  will t o t s a h y extrapolate,  ven  your  sense f hat  is oing n.  Or  you can  look  and  see  that,  fter  ou  have gi o w g o a y allowed  for ome of he  bumps along  the ay with  respect  o he  minimum  wage and  have  looked s t w t t at he ecent  eriod,  t  s ot lear  hat  here  s n  ongoing  acceleration    the ecent  umbers. t r p i i n c t t i a in r n c i f a n w m m t e i th i n b in

Maybe  more of  this  ompensation s  taking  orms  that  re ot  captured  ell  in  the easures.  That means there  ay well  be  a  cost hat  mployers  are ncurring at  s ot  going  to e  reflected    the wage data. hat  would  be  something  one  would  want  to  take ccount f,    think. T a o I

MR. JORDAN. How  important  s ext  week's umber on personal  ncome for pril? i n n i A I  look  at his  nd  say  that  f he wo  sides  f he ccounts re  going o  add  up,  we better t  a sharp t a i t t o t a a t ge slowing n  the rowth  of  personal  ncome  for he  second uarter. i g i t q

MR. PRELL.  Obviously,  e would  look  at  a  number on  personal  ncome  and  adjust w i our  forecast   appropriate. e personal  ncome  number is arely  omething hat  s f  enormous as Th i r s t i o importance n  itself  cause e think  e have  some rough  handle n how those umbers  are i be w w o n estimated  rom  the vailable ta n  hours  and  average ourly arnings  nd  so  on. f a da o h e a

"Our G t t a a t s forecasts   moderating rowth  of emand have  long een  premised n an  assumption hat  ome of g d b o t s reversal  f  stock  rices  ould  be  precipitated a  failure  orporate  arnings  o  meet  unrealistic o p w by ofc e t expectations. wever,  we have  also  arned  repeatedly at,  iven  the revailing ychology f Ho w th g p ps o investors,  greater  hock--perhaps  significant htening   monetary  policy--might   required a s a tig in be to  put  a  damper  on  the arket's  ptrend." oes that  entence  ean to  suggest  hat  e have  a  goal m u D s m t w of  putting    damper  on  the arket? a m

MR.  PRELL.  No,  it  eflects  e hought  hat  ur  stock rice  ssumption ight  be  too r th t t o p a m low or  that  e might  be  putting o  much of   premium on  what  we think  s ational vestor w to a i r in behavior.  s we see  it,  f  he arket  continues  o o  up, he  wealth ffects,  st f apital fects, A i t m t g t e co o c ef and  so  on  would  stimulate eater  ggregate  emand.

MR.  BOEHNE. The regional  conomy around  Philadelphia  ntinues  o  operate  t  a e co t a fairly gh  level  ith  mostly  modest  growth.

There  also re  quite   few  bankruptcies d  delinquencies. e Philadelphia  rm, a a an On fi

At  the ational  evel,  find urselves  acing  uch the ame economic  situation  at n l we o f m s th we had  in  March. Employment and  output rowth  appear nsustainably rong, t  there  s  little g u st bu i evidence hat  nflationary ssures  ave  begun  to  build.  e  are  wondering  how soon  or hether t i pre h W w growth  in  aggregate  emand will  low  or  inflation  ild f  he  fed unds ate emains nchanged. d s bu i t f r r u Early ata  for he urrent  uarter  re  inconclusive out  any  slowing n  the xpansion. igher d t c q a ab i e H compensation  costs  nd  a  slightly  ster se  n  the PI  in  recent  onths  are ossible rly  arning a fa i i C m p ea w signs f  accelerating  flation,  hat vidence lso s ot onclusive.  he acceleration    M2  also o in butt e a i n c T in might  be  an  early  arning  sign,  ut  that  oo  is uestionable. ,  with ata hat  emain nclear, w b t q So d t r u we basically e  still    the usiness  f alancing  isks  o etermine hat  the ppropriate urse or ar in b o b r t d w a co f monetary  policy ught o  be.

The risks  n  the inancial ctor  lso re ilted    the  direction   excess. ome i f se a a t in of S examples  are  the arrowing f  spreads,  trong ompetition  or ending  hat  as  led  to  an  easing n n o s c f l t h i credit  erms,    high  level  f onsumer  debt nd  personal  ankruptcies,  pansion f ubprime t a o c a b ex o s lending ith  questionable rms--for ample,  125 percent  oan-to-value  tios r ome equity w te ex l ra fo h lending--rising ces  f  homes and  office  uildings, pid  xpansion f EIT activity,  rrow  risk pri o b ra e o R na spreads etween  Treasuries  nd  corporate  onds  including nk  bonds, nd  rapid  rowth  of he unk b a b ju a g t j bond  sector  o  far  his  ear.   would  also ention  the tock arket,  here  P/E  ratios em out f s t y I m s m w se o phase, nd  the  strength  f he erger  movement, with  merger  offers  hat  nvolve  rowing a o t m t i g premiums over  current  tock rices.  one of hese igns s onclusive  ndividually    an  indicator s p N t s i c i as of  major inancial cess. ne can  make that  ase, ut  I  don't  hink  t s hat  onvincing    case. f ex O c b t i i t c a

They do  bear atching,  owever,  because xcesses  n  the  financial ctor  an  easily  ndermine  the w h e i se c u pursuit  f aximum  sustainable owth  and  output. o m gr

MR. BROADDUS. I  don't  ave  a  lot o ay  about he istrict  onomy today,  r. h t s t D ec M Chairman. There  hasn't  een  much change  in  our  regional  icture  ince  he  last  eeting,  nd b p s t m a overall  t  oesn't ffer at  uch from  the ational cture. i d di th m n pi

With that  n  mind,  I  thought t  ight  be  more  useful  o  relay    few comments that i i m t a made to  me recently.  e is   major  real  state  eveloper  ho H a e d w is ctive  n he  mid-Atlantic gion,  ost  of he  Southeast, d  parts  f  the outhwest. e called a i t re m t an o S H me on May  11 to  express ome concerns bout  what  he  sees  going n  in  his ector  f he conomy. s a o s o t e First--and  is  iffers om  a  lot f he nformation  e're earing--he  aid hat  rices  f th d fr o t i w h s t p o construction  terials at  e  is amiliar th  have  been  rising  harply  ery  recently, pecially  e ma th h f wi s v es th price f  concrete.  econd,  he  indicated  hat  here  re  now very igh  absorption tes  or ffice o S t t a h ra f o space  in ost  parts  f he  country. e said hat  ents  re  rising d  that  e  actually s  seen  some m o t H t r a an h ha acceleration    rent  ncreases  ost  recently.  o pick p  a little  what  Ed  Boehne  just  entioned, in i m T u on m he also aid hat  he  amount  of oney available r peculative vestment  n  real state  s eyond s t t m fo s in i e i b anything  e has  seen  in  his ong  and  very ctive  areer.  inally,    a  recent  eeting ith  other h l a c F at m w large-scale  velopers  rom  across  he  country,  e  said he eneral onsensus as that  here  re de f t h t g c w t a clear  igns n  many markets f  some overheating   the ommercial  real  state  ector. s i o in c e s

With  respect  o  the ational onomy,  for everal  uarters  here  as  been  a  tug-of-war t n ec s q t h between  those ho expect eal DP  growth  to  decelerate preciably,  cluding  he reenbook, w r G ap in t G and  those ho think  hat  trong  omestic emand will ontinue  o  propel trong  conomic w t s d d c t s e expansion. ith  the  Asian  drag  on  net xports  xpected  o  peak  soon, he  Greenbook, s  we have W e e t t a been  discussing re  this  orning, s ow predicting at    significant entory  orrection ll he m i n th a inv c wi bring bout  sharply  lower rowth  in he  second  quarter.  ow, it  s ertainly  ue  hat  nventory a s g t N i c tr t i accumulation  as quite  obust  n  the irst arter.  ut  as  I  see t,  nventory-sales ios e till w r i f qu B i i rat ar s very  much in  line.   don't  ear uch anecdotal  vidence f xcessive  nventories    my region. I h m e o e i in So,  they ay or  may not e  excessive.  ut  in  general,  t  s ard o scape he onclusion  hat  t his m b B i i h t e t c t a t point  redictions   a  deceleration  il own to  a  general  eeling  hat  he xpansion ill ave  to p of bo d f t t e w h slow  from  its  urrent  rack  n  general  rinciples, ch  is ertainly  t  an  unreasonable  iew  to c t o p whi c no v take.

But  as  I  see  t, en  if  he xpansion oes  slow, he rowth  of emand has  already i ev t e d t g d outstripped e  growth  of roductivity  r   long  time. r.  Chairman,  you  expressed  ome concern th p fo a M s about  this  n estimony  ack  in  October s  I  recall. nce hen  we have  seen hat  has  happened  in i t b a Si t w labor arkets. e  have  had  average onthly  growth  of  about 00,000 obs,  hich  is bout  double m W m 2 j w a the  trend  rowth  in  the abor  orce. verybody  agrees hat  he abor arkets re xtremely ight, g l f E t t l m a e t and  that  eems  at  least  ome degree o  pose  an  inflation  sk  oing orward. s tos t ri g f

On the  other  ide f he ssue,  eople ike  e have  been  predicting gher nflation  r s o t i p l m hi i fo a  long  time,  nd  those  redictions  rtainly  ve  not  been  borne  out y  events. o,  I  think    little a p ce ha b S a humility  n  our art s retty  uch in  order t his  tage  nd  I  acknowledge  that.  ut  frankly,   I o p i p m a t s a B as look  forward nd  try  o ssess he isks  n  the utlook,    still ink  hat  he ey  risks  re n the a t a t r i o I th t t k a o inflation  de. t ccurred  o e that  t  ight  be  time  for e to  sit  ack  and  review,  ith  the elp f si I o t m i m m b w h o

my staff,  at  the nalytical  sis or hat  oncern  might  be.  I  would  like  o  summarize  that wh a ba f t c t analysis  or ou this  orning, nd  I  will o  so  quickly.  t as  to o  with  real  nterest  te  ehavior f y m a d I h d i ra b and what  that  ight  be  telling  . m us

First,   eems clear  nough at  this  tage hat  ermanent roductivity  ins re  a  major its e s t p p ga a force riving  his  conomic  expansion. he staff s  revised  pward  its  stimate  f roductivity d t e T ha u e o p growth.

We  do see  some slowing n  some manufacturing  ndustries   alifornia d  other i i inC an District  ates, th  exports  iminishing  nd  import ompetition  rom  Asia  picking p.  The  volume st wi d a c f u of  cargo hrough he istrict's   ajor  seaports--and    course wo  of  those,  os Angeles  and t t D sixm of t L

We  show real DP  growth  of  around -3/4 m ou G 2 percent  n  the urrent  uarter  nd  also n  the econd  half  f his  ear.

As has  already  een  mentioned,  he .S. b t U economy is xtremely trong,  nd  the trength  s ll  he  more  impressive  n  view  of he rag  that  s e s a s i a t i t d i being  exerted  y  developments n  Asia  and  by  the eakness  in  the gricultural tor  hat  ary b i w a sec t G Stern  ust  entioned.  Central  o  this  ssessment,  f ourse,  s he  labor  arket.  People re j m t a o c i t m a working, pending oney,  buying  houses  and  stocks,  nd  baby  boomers  are lanning  or s m a p f retirement.  'm oing  to  focus y comments today  on inflation  d  the tock arket. I g m an s m

First  f ll,  y  almost ny  measure  inflation  pears o e  well  contained, en o a b a ap t b ev falling.  be  fair, me of  the mprovement  in  the PI  is  accounted or y  the tatistical To so i C f b s and sampling hanges, nd  much of he  improvement  in he road  indexes s ccounted or y energy. c a t t b i a f b Although  that  ould urn round  quickly,  oes  not  appear hat  nergy ricing  s ecessarily  e  of c t a itd t e p i n on those emporary  serendipitous  ctors  ringing  bout isinflation ven  deflation. re t fa b a d or  e Mo importantly,    the urrent  ow  inflation  vironment,  usinesses d  households ave  available in c l en b an h very  clear  ost nd  price mpulses eflective   ure  supply nd  demand pressures.  hat  is, c a i r ofp a T inflation   ot  distorting  rket  supply  and  demand pricing  essages.  For  example, eak demand isn ma m w from  Asia  means that  here  s ittle  essure  n nternational modity markets.  Domestic  service t i l pr i i com and  other abor ntensive rkets hat  re  not irectly fected  y  international petition  re l i ma t a d af b com a seeing ome price  ncreases.  lthough  there re  exceptions,  en  wage pressures  eem  mostly s i A a ev s confined o he  high  labor  emand areas ike  hose or omputer pecialists,  ckbrokers,  d  other t t d l t f c s sto an capital  arket  or isk  anagement people. ome of hat  ressure  s  showing  through n  the m r m S t p i i averages ut ot  nearly  s  much as  might  be  expected ith  a  4.3  percent  nemployment rate. b n a w u These  clear  arket  pricing  ignals  ave  given  employers he herewithal o  focus n  their  osts m s h t w t o c and  the inal  roduct rice  hat  he arket  will ear. f  he osts  f roduction, vestment, f p p t t m b I t c o p in or expansion annot e  recovered  n  the  market,  lans re  changed.  Inventories n  be  more  tightly c b i p a ca controlled th  available chnology.  one are he  days  of  padding lanning stimates wi te G t p e of production  nd  budgets ith  the nowledge  that  nflation  uld  provide oom to over roduction, a w k i wo r c p inventory,   other orecasting  rors.  he result,   ourse,  s ignificantly  anced  productivity or f er T ofc i s enh in  today's  conomy. This  leads e to  a  few comments on  the tock arket. e m s m

No matter  hat  model  is sed, aluation  omes down to  a  function  f arnings  nd w u v c o e a interest  tes.  t ay be  that  arket articipants  e  forecasting  proved  productivity, ch ra I m m p ar im whi

implies  igher arnings,  r  they ay be  expecting  ower nflation, ch  implies  ower  interest h e o m l i whi l rates.  ither  ould  support  /E  multiples   the urrent  ange.  Or  perhaps he ubble conomy E w P in c r t b e article   The Economist  a  few weeks ago  is ight  nd  the arket s rong. Where does  that eave in r a m i w l us? I  for ne  think  t  ould  be  a  mistake o ocus onetary  policy  n  one  segment  of inancial o i w t f m o f asset  rices, mely  the  stock arket.  First  f ll,  onetary  policy  s   broad-gauged  ool hat  s p na m o a m i a t t i not  sufficiently e-tuned  ingle  ut  one  set f sset  rices,  articularly   a  few  equations fin tos o o a p p one away from  short-term terest  tes.  he Economist  and  others ave  suggested  hat  he ubble in ra T h t t b could  be  pricked  ith  a  small ate  ike. ut  with he aby  boomers  focused n  investing r w r h B t b o fo retirement,  e arket  might  bounce  right  ack.  It robably ould  take   sizable  nterest  te th m b p w a i ra increase  o ove the arket--one  hat  ould  invert  he  yield  urve--and  uch  an  increase obably t m m t w t c s pr is ot ustified    the est  f he conomy. The move might  have  to e  reversed  hortly  fter  t s n j by r o t e b s a i i made in  any  event. he better  trategy,    eems  to  me,  is o  focus n  the eal  conomy and  let T s it s t o r e market  participants    the tock arket  pricing. do s m

In  summing where  we are  with  the urrent  conomy,  Asia  remains   source f c e a o uncertainty  d  for ow U.S.  inflation   ell  contained.  ut  unless rowth  slows  considerably an n isw B g either  rom  reduced inal  emand or  inventory  djustments, r  virtuous  ycle ould urn  itself  t f f d a ou c c b ou as  inflation  ats p.

A theme  among other  ankers round  the istrict   hat ending  s eing riven y b a D ist l i b d b asset ssessments  nd  not  at ll y  cash  flows r  concerns bout uture  ash  flows.

In  manufacturing, rectors ve  cited  umerous examples  of cquisition  ices  hat di ha n a pr t they  think  re oo igh.

Our  farm  economy remains table, t  there  re  some signs f  weakness.  District s bu a o wheat  production  s own in  terms  of creage,  ut  the uality   the rop  is xcellent. ,  perhaps i d a b q of c e So there  ill e  some pressure  n wheat  prices.  he beef nd  pork  industries  e  under ome pressure, w b o T a ar s but  overall  hose ndustries  pear o  be  stable  or ow. t i ap t f n

It eems  to e, and  I  think  t  eems  to  others, at  he sian isA s m i s th t A situation  s  worsened  again. here  are wo  countries at  re  especially  oblematic  n  very ha T t th a pr i different  ys,  Japan  and  Indonesia.    think  he pillover  fects  n he ther  sian  countries e wa I t s ef i t o A ar also   little  re disturbing  an hey  were  when we met  in  March. So,  there  ould e  a  bigger a mo th t c b impact  on  the nited tates  han  I  felt  here  ould  be  the ast  ime e met. U S t t w l t w

Secondly,  et  e talk    little  out rice ovements. There  is  slight celeration l m a ab p m a ac of inflation    the orecast.  n  a  way we should e  expecting    slight celeration  cause e have in f I b a ac be w had  some positive pply hocks.  Simply  as  these ear  off,  e will et ome acceleration.  e su s w w g s Th Greenbook  mentions  a  few shocks  on  the ther ide,  ne  of hem  being obacco.   do  not uite o s o t t I q know how to  interpret  e  rising  ent hock.  That  may be  a shock  or  it ay not  be  one.  In  any th r s m event,  here re ome shocks  on the ther ide. n  my view,  the  basic essage  from  the rice ide t a s o s I m p s is hat  n  their  ace hese rice  ovements seem  quite inor.  Why  do  we worry  about hem? That t o f t p m m t brings  p  the  third  oint;  t  s he AIRU. u p i i t N We  worry  because  of  the nemployment gap. u

Some of  that  nemployment gap  goes  away in  the reenbook  forecast.  gather  rom u G I f the  comments that  ome of ou  made that  he  gap  goes  away in  your  own forecasts    well.  I s y t as personally  hink  hat  ome of his  ap  will o  away when future  conometricians estimate eir t t s t g g e re th equations  or he  1990s.  This  does  seem to  be  a  relationship t  s hifting,  d  time eries f t tha i s an s analysis  s ot  a  very ood  way to nalyze hat  ind  of  shift. i n g a t k

Let  me also ut n the  table    new uncertainty out AIRU p o a ab N that    have  just  egun  to I b think bout.  I  have  not eard oo  many people ention  it,  ut t oes  strike  that ompared  to a h t m b i d me c earlier mes,  irms hat  eed  additional bor  re  increasingly  rming ut  their  roduction  o ther ti f t n la a fa o p t o

Let  me also alk  bout  the ubble  issue.  irst,    s entioned n  the reenbook  that t a b F it i m i G M2  growth  has  slowed  and  is ending  its  ay back  to ithin hat  I  will all  he ohn cone.  On w w w w c t K the  stock arket, f ourse he  price  ndexes re  high.  But  when we compare  the arnings/price m o c t i a e ratio  nd  long-term  eal nterest  tes,  find hat  he quity  remium is till  sitive   about  1 a r i ra we t t e p s po by percentage  oint.  one of s  knows what  the quity  remium should e, ut   personally   not p N u e p b b I do find t  urprising at  his  quity  remium has  dropped  slightly.  e reason s hat  ne  of he hings i s th t e p Th i t o t t that  inancial novation  as  done  is o  make it  ossible  or verage eople o  buy a  more f in h t p f a p t diversified  rtfolio   equities. e upshot f hat  s  a  lower quity remium. po of Th o t i e p

I  am still,    I ave  been  all long,  neasy  about his  ituation,   it  akes  policy as h a u t s and m a very  tough  call.  ut  I  think  hat  he ncertainties   great  nough for s  to ake a  strong B t t u are e u m argument  for olding teady or ow. What that  oes  mean,  as  many others  ave  noted,  s hat h s f n d h i t when and  if  e do  make a  change, hich  might  not e  too  long rom  now,  we may have  to  move w w b f sharply.   think e take hat  ost pon  ourselves  ut  for e it  s   cost orth  bearing. hank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Ferguson.

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, r.  Chairman.  In  the ntermeeting riod,  became M i pe I more certain at  he  sense f pside isks  hat  any of s  expressed  t he  last  eeting as th t o u r t m u a t m w continuing  o  hold rue,  nd  I  have  detected    bit  f hat  ense oday n ur  discussion ound he t t a a o t s t i o ar t table.  owever,  I  must  admit hat  he conomy is howing  some signs f  an  ongoing  uptrend nd H t t e s o a also f  some possible  merging  weakness.  The first-quarter  , as  Mike Prell  aid,  as a o e GDP s w "stunner."  n  my view,  it  oes  require  ome general  eassessment   our  outlook or he est  f  this I d s r of f t r o year.  Early ndications   retail les  nd  the rders nd  shipments ata uggest  hat  he  robustness i of sa a o a d s t t seen  in he  first arter, iven y  both  consumers  and  producers,  ikely  o  continue or he t qu dr b isl t f t foreseeable ture.  bviously,  abor  arkets  are ight,   there  s ot uch more to  say  there. fu O l m t so i n m Manufacturing  as  not  yet eturned  o  its  ecember levels.  actory utput nd  operating  atios e h r t D F o a r ar below  what  had  prevailed  ast  ear. owever,  manufacturing  utput id  grow about .3  percent l y H o d 0 last  onth. So,  while here  re  signs f eakness  in  that ector  f he conomy,  it  ay be  turning m t a o w s o t e m around  a  little.   balance,    would  agree ith he haracterization t    heard efore,  hich  is On I w t c tha I b w that  he vidence earing  n  the  near-term  ourse f he  domestic conomy seems somewhat t e b o c o t e inconclusive.

What worries e in  this  ixed  picture  s hat  here re  some special  actors at m m i t t a f th benefited  s  on  inflation    the ast hat  ay well  be  on the ane now. In  particular,  worried u in p t m w I  am about  indications    some acceleration    compensation. t s rue hat  he CI increased  t   low of in I i t t t E a a 2.7  percent  nnual ate  ver he hree  onths  ended  in  March,  but he  12-month  wage and  salary a r o t t m t compensation  components  have  broken  through he   percent  evel  or he irst  me  in  several t 4 l f t f ti years. ealth  insurance  osts  ay also e  giving ome indications  n  uptick,  ven  though  the H c m b s ofa e evidence s rimarily  necdotal.    did ot  hear ery  much about hat  s  we went  around  the able, i p a I n v t a t but  there as some discussion  f hat  ere  at he oard.  Now, these ncreases   labor  osts  ay w o t h t B i in c m well  be  occurring  t  a  time hen productivity  owth  may have  moved up  to  a  new higher rend, a w gr t but  I  o  wonder  if  ven  1.5  percent  rowth  in  productivity  ll e  enough  to ffset erall  ncreases d e g wi b o ov i of  4  to  percent  n  wages and  salaries. e  changes  in  labor  ompensation hat  ay be  ahead  are 5 i Th c t m particularly risome  because  I  think  hey ay occur n  the ontext  f lattening    possibly wor t m i c o f or declining  rofit rgins  in  the orporate  ector.  ome of hese eclining ofit rgins  seem to  be p ma c s S t d pr ma hitting e  high-tech  ector  s  well.  As we well  know, some of he enefits  have  had  in  the th s a t b we economy have  been  driven  y  relatively ,  in  fact  eclining,  ices  n  the igh-tech  ector.  hat b low d pr i h s T may start  o hange. c

The second  risk  hat    see n  this  conomy is he  "immaculate" lowdown in he t I i e t s t growth  of conomic  activity  at  ike Prell  as  presented  n he reenbook  forecast.  am e th M h i t G I concerned hat  t ay well  not  work out he  way that  ike has  projected.  f  nventory  nvestments t i m t M I i i reflect e  expectations  ales rowth, nd  I  think  ome members have  referred   the nventoryth ofs g a s to i sales atio  s  not eing  out f ine,  hen   am quite oncerned ecause  I elieve  s  do  others  hat r a b o l t I c b b a t consumers  are  not ikely  o  show much restraint.  viously,  here  re lenty  f obs.  few l t Ob t a p o j A members also  have  pointed o  some inconsistencies  the ncome side f  the rojections.   many t on i o p As

have  said,  ignificant  alth onsiderations  e riving  onsumers.  I  think  e can  see  on  the asis s we c ar d c w b of  what  happened  in he irst arter  hat  nventory  nvestment  ight  not  slow  nearly  s  much as t f qu t i i m a the  Greenbook  has  projected.  n balance,  he omestic ndicators e,  n  my judgment, enerally O t d i ar i g pointing  oward  mounting  upside isks. t r

Turning  to he nternational e,    think  s  does  Vice  Chair cDonough t i sid I a M that  he t turmoil  n  Asia  is ntering    new and  highly npredictable cial  nd  political  ase  that  e have i e a u so a ph w not  seen efore. t  our  last  eeting,    reported  hat  he conomies  of orea  and  Thailand ight  be b A m I t t e K m bouncing  along he ottom  for uite    while. ow, it eems  as  though  the ndonesian  ituation  y t b q a N s I s ma have  placed   trap  oor  beneath hem,  and  the utlook  or he  entire gion ooks   lot  ess  ertain a d t o f t re l a l c than  it  id ven  a  few weeks ago.  However,  that  ituation   uite  luid  nd  could eturn  o n d e s isq f a r t a improving rend elatively  ickly.  apan  is ven  less ikely  o  act s  an  engine f  growth  in  the t r qu J e l t a o near erm  than   thought arlier,    we cannot ook here or elp. ith regard o  the ther ajor t I e so l t f h W t o m economies  in  the egion,  ice  Chair cDonough r V M mentioned  India,  ut   would  turn ur  attention b I o to China.  China  has  committed  to  holding  heir  eg, hich  I  think  s n  act f reat  nternational t p w i a o g i diplomacy  and  statesmanship. t  its  uccess  oes  depend  on  strong iscipline  d  also n an Bu s d d an o ambitious arget  f  percent  rowth, hich  seems  less nd  less ikely. erefore,  n  this  sian t o 8 g w a l Th i A context,    think hina  adds  a  bit  f ncertainty. I C o u

Finally, t  e respond r  refer  o  some of  the omments that  y colleague, vernor le m o t c m Go Gramlich, ade with  respect  o  the AIRU. m t N I  agree ith  him  in he ense hat    do  not elieve  e w t s t I b w know exactly  hat  the  actual  AIRU w N is. here  are eople  in  the  room who surely  ill ell  s  that T p w t u it s n  unemployment rate f  5.5  percent. here  are thers ho will ay  that  t  s .2  percent. i a o T o w s i i 5 There  are  those ho probably hought    year go  that  t  as 6  percent.  e  don't  ctually ow. I w t a a i w W a kn believe  hat  he  capital epening nd  labor  uality  mprovements  of ecent  ears ay have t t de a q i r y m

allowed  for n  increase  n roductivity. ope  that  s rue.   believe  hat  usinesses  re ow a i p I  h i t I t b a n focused ore on achieving  fficiencies,    that  tructural  anges  have  made the conomy m e and s ch e somewhat less  nflation  one.  I  do not elieve, wever,  that  hat  eans all  imits  ave  been i pr b ho t m l h removed. I  think  e are  very  close o  those imits. w t l

In  summary,  based  on  domestic oncerns lone,    think  e are robably ocused c a I w p f correctly  n  the pside isks.    believe  hat  n  the asis  f omestic oncerns lone t ight  be o u r I t o b o d c a i m reasonable  or s  to  consider  cting  n he ear uture.  owever,  I  don't  hink  e need  to  act ow f u a i t n f H t w n as  I xpect hat  here  ill  e  only   slow  unraveling  n he orces  hat  ave  held nflation   ay.

MS. RIVLIN.  I  am substantially re  Roger  Ferguson  is,  nd  I'm ot  sure   can  put whe a n I the  case ny  better;   presented  t  ery  well.  We  have  a  very ifficult  oblem.  We  have  had  an a he i v d pr extremely trong conomy,  which  continues  o e strong. t  as  been  an  extraordinary s e t b I h performance. very  time  we meet  we have  a  few more anecdotes  bout he  tightness   labor E a t in markets,  nd  we are  beginning o  get ore and  more signs f  tightness  ther orts: me a t m o ofo s so speculative ilding, me land  price  ncreases, idence f hat  ind.  But  I  believe  e have bu so i ev o t k w learned    few  things  bout he conomy in  the ast  ouple f  years hat  ead e to e  reluctant a a t e l c o t l m b to move quickly. ne is hat  he  economy clearly  s  not  as  inflation  one  at ow  levels O t t i pr l of unemployment as  we thought t  as. Some of  the  reasons ay be  temporary nd  we need  to  watch i w m a to  see  if  hey re urning  round.  The rising llar, e alling l rices, d  the low  growth  in  the t a t a do th f oi p an s costs f  health  are enefits  ay all e  exerting  eneficial fects   inflation at  re ot  going  to o c b m b b ef on th a n

last.  ut  some of he easons eem to  be  much more lasting.  believe  hat  here  as  been  a B t r s I t t h productivity  shift,  obably rom  a  combination f echnological  velopments,  ew up pr f o t de n management reforms nd  attitudes, egulation,  obal  ompetition, wer  inflation  pectations, a der gl c lo ex and  new ways that  usinesses  re eacting  o  labor carcities. b a r t s

The second  thing    believe  e have  learned  s hat  ight  abor  arkets o  us  a  lot f I w i t t l m d o good.  They generate  ore experienced  orkers, ore training,  re education,  ore  opportunities m w m mo m for romotion,  nd  more incentives   invest  n neself  nd  in  one's  orkers. hat  investment  n p a to i o a w T i skills tually  s appening  and  should ay  off n  productivity  provements  in he  future.  he low ac i h p i im t T unemployment levels  eem to enerate  ressure  or apital  eepening,  hich may have  an s g p f c d w unusually  igh  payoff  n  the resent  tate  f ur  technology.  one of his  eans that  here  re o h i p s o o N t m t a n limits,    Roger  Ferguson ut  it.  he  economy cannot ontinue  o row at he  first-quarter as p T c t g t pace without  unning ut  of orkers nd  generating  erious  age and  eventually ice  ressures. r o w a s w pr p

I  would  be  very orried ut or he  prospect  hat  he xpansion ill low  for  he w b f t t t e w s t reasons hat  re et orth  n  the reenbook.  I  tend o hink  hat  he reenbook  is   bit  ptimistic t a s f i G t t t t G a o about  Asia. e  may not  see  a  rout ut ore deterioration  Indonesia, rea,  and  possibly  lso n W b m in Ko a i Japan.

That  leaves he tock arket, hich  clearly   too igh.  I'm  not  sure hat  nything  e t s m w is h t a w might  do  here ould  provide    good  signal, r s ignaling e  stock arket  an  appropriate y to w a no i s th m wa use  monetary  policy.    am inclined   the iew  that  e will et   correction   earnings  eteriorate I to v w g a as d and,  if  'm ight  bout sia,  s  that ource f eterioration ks n.  So,  I  would  join  hose ho I r a A a s o d sin i t w would  urge  that  e wait et  another  ix eeks and  see here  we are ecause   think    tightening w y s w w b I a might  prove  unnecessary.

In  the ase  of he nteraction  tween  productivity  d  compensation,  hich  is c t i be an w obviously    key  determinant  f osts  nd  hence  prices,   s ard o  read ither  roductivity a o c a it i h t e p or compensation rends ight  ow.

MR. MEYER. Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  will e  referring    couple f harts b toa o c that    am having assed round.   At  the ast  eeting,  any members of his  ommittee  expressed I p a 2 l m m t C concern hat  nflation  sks  ight  be  increasing  ight  f he revailing ghtness   labor arkets t i ri m inl o t p ti in m and  the omentum  in  domestic emand.

I  want  to ocus y remarks  on  the abor  arket, nflation  ta,  nd  on  the uestion  f f m l m i da a q o whether  the  evidence oints  o   still gher rend  ate  f  growth  in  productivity  d  the rospects p t a hi t r o an p for n  imminent  slowing  to elow-trend  rowth.  I  will  ave  some comments on  the onetary a b g h m policy mplications   the  stock  arket  and  of  Asia uring he olicy  o-around. i of m d t p g

At  the ast  eeting, any emphasized  that  t  as  important  hat  conomic  growth l m m i w t e slow  quickly  nd  significantly  en  the lready  ight  abor arkets.   refer  o his  oncern  as a giv a t l m I t t c growth  risk.  pecifically,  s he oncern  that  bove-trend  rowth  would  raise  tilization es S it  t i c a g u rat further  nd  thereby  xacerbate  he  risks  f igher  nflation.  e bottom  line  s hat he ighter bor a e t o h i Th i t t t la

The  bottom  line  s hat f  e were  worried bout he ight  abor w u i t i w a t t l markets  at he ast  eeting,  e should e  more worried oday.   am. t l m w b t I

What about  the rospect  f  an  imminent  slowing n  growth  going orward,  erhaps o p o i f p t below trend  n  the econd  half  s  in  the taff recast?  t eems  to  me that  he conomy has i s a s fo I s t e somewhat of  a  knife  dge  quality  ith  respect  o  the ace  of he xpansion. n the ne  hand, he e w t p t e O o t fundamentals  ontinue o ook  very  positive. ere  is mpressive  omentum c t l Th i m in  domestic emand; d financial nditions  ppear o  be  very  supportive; d  interest-sensitive  ors  f he conomy co a t an sect o t e continue  o  prosper.  t s ot ard  to  imagine  that e could ave  continued  bove-trend  rowth t I i n h w h a g ahead.

Still,  ree  actors e  likely  o  weigh  on  the xpansion oing orward. irst, th f ar t e g f F assuming  that  he atest aff timate  f  a  $103 billion crease  n  inventory  ccumulation  n he t l st es o in i a i t first arter  s n the ark and  is ot evised  own going  forward,  he ate f nventory  nvestment qu i o m n r d t r o i i in  the irst arter  s  almost ertainly  sustainable. deed,  he  two  most  impressive  umbers f qu i c un In t n related  o his  orecast e  4.3  and  103.

Second,  the xternal  rag  from  a  combination f he merging  Asian  economies, e d o t e Japan, nd  the ong  cumulative ppreciation  he  dollar  hould ontinue, though t  a  diminished a l a oft s c al a rate  fter  he irst arter. a t f qu

Third,  he ositive pulse rom  the  stock arket  should t  least  iminish, rtly  n t p im f m a d pa i response  o  a  slowing n  the xpansion nd  hence  in he rowth  of arnings.  his  is n  line  ith  the t i e a t g e T i w staff  orecast d  would  contribute   slower rowth  of he conomy in  1999 after  he  effects an toa g t e t from  reduced nventory  nvestment  nd  external  rag  had  mostly un heir  ourse. articularly i i a d r t c P because  of he  interaction    inventory  orrection d  external ag  and  perhaps ith  some help t of c an dr w from  the tock arket,  here  s he otential r   significant  owing  immediately head.  Still, s m t i t p fo a sl a there s ome question  bout  how much longer ne  should ait or his  lowdown especially i s a o w f t s in light  f he act hat  rowth  has  consistently  tperformed  xpectations er he  last  wo years nd o t f t g ou e ov t t a in  light  f he ery ight  nd  indeed ow tighter bor  arkets. o t v t a n la m

At  the ast  eeting,  embers of  this  ommittee  expressed  he ollowing  oncern l m m C t f c about  wage pressures   the ontext  f ight  abor arkets. ere  is   quote  from  the  minutes: but in c o t l m H a " additional provements  in  productivity  owth  could ot  be  counted n  to ffset  urther creases im gr n o o f in in  the ate  f rowth  of abor  ompensation,  hich  were  more likely  o ccur f  abor arkets ere r o g l c w t o i l m w to  tighten  urther."  he  staff,  wever, oes  plan n higher  roductivity  owth  to ffset  he f T ho d o p gr o t effects  f ighter bor  arkets,  t east  or  while.  This s ery  much central  o  their  orecast. o t la m a l f a i v t f

The staff's  cision  o  raise  roductivity  owth  reflected eir  ssessment f wo  new de t p gr th a o t pieces f ata: he  adjusted  roductivity  ries, flecting orrection  he ata n hours--the o d t p se re a  c oft d o length f  the ay  period--and e eport  n  multifactor  oductivity  at  ndicated ster owth  in o p th r o pr th i fa gr capital  ervices  n  1996.  I  followed ith   lag nd  some discount  actor  he taff's  rlier  ward s i w a a f t s ea up revision  n  their  stimate  f rend  roductivity  owth.  Perhaps   will ltimately llow his i e o t p gr I u fo t revision  s  well  but ot ow;  I  have  some reservations.    lower stimate  nd  the taff's  gher a n n My e a s hi estimate  ork about  equally  ell n  explaining e  recent  ecline  n  unemployment via kun's w w i th d i O Law.  The adjusted  roductivity  ries  rovides    hint f   sharper  reak n  the rend  ate  f p se p a o a b i t r o productivity  owth  in id-1995 but t  s nly   hint  n  my judgment  and  not efinitive  ough  for gr m i i o a i d en my taste  o ustify    upward  revision   my estimate  f he  trend.  ndeed,  ssuming  a  constant t j an in o t I a trend  rom 1990  onward, he  staff's  oductivity  uation  ields  n  estimate  f ust  .1  percent  or f t pr eq y a o j 1 f the  trend  ate  f roductivity.  ere  is n  this  ase o  difference    the stimated  rend hether r o p Th i c n in e t w published  r  adjusted  roductivity  ta re sed.  This  trend  s lso dentical  he rend  stimated o p da a u i a i tot t e over  the arlier 74  to  1990  period.  hile  the  staff's  alysis  uggestive  nd  it efinitely  t e 19 W an iss a d go my attention,   ppears o  me that  he  recent  obust  roductivity  owth  can  be  explained  y  a ita t t r p gr b combination f  a  more modest  increase  n  productivity  d  a  normal  cyclical bound. o i an re

What about he  inflation  d  the age data?  Should  developments ince he ast t an w s t l meeting  make us  less  oncerned bout  the otential r n acceleration    wages? Let  me focus c a p fo a in first  the  recent  ata n  core  CPI. The staff ojected  2.2 ercent  ate f ncrease  or his on d o pr a p r o i f t measure  over  1998 and  over  1999, he  same  as  over  1997. On a  consistent  thodological  asis, t me b however,  this  ranslates  to  n  increase  rom  2.2 ercent  ver  1997 to .4 ercent  ver  1998 and t in a f p o 2 p o 2.7  percent  ver  1999. The  first estion  bout nflation   hether  the rend n  core  CPI is table o qu a i isw t i s or  declining  r lready  ebounding. he 12-month  increase  s ow 2.1  percent,  tenth  elow 1997. o a r T i n a b

This  perhaps uggests  n  underlying  ate  f nflation  at  s till  able  o eclining.  ut  as s a r o i th i s st t d B indicated   the harts    have  passed round,  he  annualized  nflation  tes  ver hree-month  nd in c I a t i ra o t a six-month ntervals  hibit  uite    pronounced  upward  trend. he  three-month  ate  s ow 2.8 i ex q a T r i n percent  nd  the  six-month  ate s .5  percent.  his eads e to  suspect  hat  he nderlying  nflation a r i 2 T l m t t u i rate  ay already  e  higher  oing  forward han he  staff ggests  nd  it ay also  e  rising  aster m b g t t su a m b f than  they roject. p

Let  me admit  that    have  taken   very  different  proach n  interpreting  PI data I a ap i theC than  I  did ith  the roductivity  ta.   weighed  more heavily  he ower requency ata n w p da I t l f d o productivity, n-playing  some signs n  the igher requency ata hat  here ight  have  been  a dow i h f d t t m recent  reak n  trend. n the  core  CPI on  the ther and,   emphasized  the  higher  requency ata n b i O o h I f d i an  effort   identify  change  in he rend uickly.    admit  that    was looking or aster flation  d to a t t q I I f f in an I  found  it.   as not ooking or igher  roductivity  owth, nd  I  did ot  find  t. ut  this  s here Iw l f h p gr a n i B i w my intuition  s  taken e. ha m

The  wage and  compensation ata,  ncluding  CI,  compensation er our, nd  average d i E p h a hourly  earnings, int  o  some upward  drift   wage and  compensation ates.  ut  as  shown on  the po t in r B second  page, he  acceleration   uch more evident  n  the  12-month  rates  han  in  some of  the t ism i t higher requency ata. specially  n  the  case  of CI,  the atest arterly ading  s ore  benign f d E i E l qu re i m than  what  is uggested  y  the  12-month  changes. utting  t  ll ogether,   balance t  eems  to e s b P i a t on i s m that he isk  f  higher  nflation  s  escalated  bit  urther nce he ast  eeting. t r o i ha a f si t l m

MR.  KOHN. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  When  the ommittee  last  et  it  as C m w concerned bout  the isk  f n  upward trend  o nderlying  nflation    the uture, a r o a t u i in f and  in ome respects  hat  ossibility ms  in  fact  o ave  acquired  ore weight s t p see t h m over  the ntermeeting riod.  n  particular,   economy looks s  if t  ill  e i pe I the a i w b putting  ore strain  n  the abor arkets. m o l m

Perhaps  accentuating ncerns,  he  slowdown in  economic  growth  to  a  more co t sustainable ce  is till st    projection.  date,  espite  he vident ncreases pa s ju a To d t e i in real nterest  tes, nancial rkets how few signs f  any  erosion  n  the i ra fi ma s o i accommodative  conditions at  ave  been  bolstering  mand.

By themselves,  hese nfluences  ould  seem to  argue n  favor f   small t i w i o a firming  f  money market onditions,    in lternative   In  these  espects, o c as a C. r analogies  ould e  drawn to he ituation   March 1997,  when the  Committee c b t s in chose  to buy  some insurance"  gainst  he nflation  sks  ssociated  hat  ime " a t i ri a att t with  strong  ggregate  emand,  or  last  eptember,  hen tightening bor a d S w la markets  put he  Committee  on a  path oward  policy  irming  n  early  ovember, t t f i N had  not sian  events ntervened. A i

When  a  wider  array  f actors  s onsidered, wever, he  shift   inflation o f i c ho t in risks  ay not  be  so  clear  ut. n  the taff  orecast,  flation    1999  is o m c I s f in in n higher  han  in  the ast  reenbook.  Once again,  ew information  n  and t l G n o analysis  f he  supply ide f  the conomy provide   counterweight  o tronger o t s o e a t s demand and  higher utput. ike has  discussed  he ey  elements n  the o M t k i forecast.  ost  importantly,    he  noted,  he ise  n  the evel  f utput as  been M as t r i l o o h about  matched  by  an  increase  n stimated  otential, ng  to  faster end i e p owi tr productivity,  at  eaves  he utput  ap about nchanged.  And that igher th l t o g u h productivity  so s  manifest  n  a  temporarily wer AIRU al i i lo N as  firms ompete c for ore profitable  siness. m bu

As a  result,  e taff recast  uggests  o  greater  rgency  for irming  olicy th s fo s n u f p than  in arch. But,  as  was  the  case hen, he utlook  oes  embody  a M t t o d significant  ward incline   underlying  nflation   he  current  ederal  unds up to i att f f rate. everal f  you noted ur  concern hat  nflation  ght  rise  y  more.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. That  was an excellent d  balanced an presentation   he roblems  that  e confront.  uestions or on?  If ot,    will tart. oft p w Q f D n I s

It s pparent  hat ur  discussion s  been  one  of he ore interesting ndtables at i a t o ha t m rou th we have  had  for   while n ur  effort   assess  he nderlying  rosscurrents   he conomy and  the a i o o t u c int e policy  radeoffs.  will over he ame subject  atter  nd  review  it  oint  y  point. t I c t s m a p b

First,  agree ith  a  number of ou  who view  the sian  crisis d  the nternational I w y A an i financial stem  as  involving  rucial  ssues.    must  say  that    am a  lot  ore pessimistic  out  Japan sy c i I I m ab

than  is mplicit  he  Greenbook  analysis.  n  my view, hat  uge  economy is nder  significant i int I t h u downward strain, ich  unless t tabilizes  ll pill  ver  into  he  United tates  n  ways  that    do wh i s wi s o t S i I not  think  e can  fully  nticipate   his  oint. ortunately e  size  f he ndonesia  conomy is ot w a att p F th o t I e n of  sufficient  gnitude o  have  a  major  impact n  its  eighbors  r he nited tates.  onetheless, ma t o n o t U S N it s nough  to  be  a  serious  ssue. i e i

The

A very  significant  t  not idely iscussed  roblem  is he  Korean  labor ituation. bu w d p t s Korea  has  a  big conomy. It s   lot  arger  han ndonesia's  ough  obviously  ot early  he ize f e i a l t I th n n t s o Japan's.  t as  improved  quite  ignificantly;    will ecall at  hey ad  virtually   usable entral I h s you r th t h no c bank  reserves, d  now they  have  built  hem  up  to  almost 30  billion.   that  egard,  f  t  ere  not an t $ In r i i w for he  current  abor nrest  nd  the olitical  oblems,    believe  orea  clearly uld  be  a t l u a p pr I K wo stabilizing ce n  Asia.  But  as  best   can  judge,  he orean  economy has  started  urn  n  a for i I t K tot i negative  irection,  d  I  don't  hink  e can  forecast e agnitude f he otential cline. d an t w th m o t p de

The second  issue  hat  e have  discussed  s he .S.  stock arket.  Its erformance,  s t w i t U m p a we are  all  ware, as  been  crucial  n his  irtuous cle. he rise  n  stock rices  as  had  a  variety a h i t v cy T i p h of ositive  esults,  cluding e  stimulation   increased  ffective mand that  n  turn as  led o p r in th of e de i h t larger  ederal  overnment  revenues hat  irst wered he udget eficit d  more  recently oduced f g t f lo t b d an pr a  surplus.  he  market  is till erting    positive fect  n  the conomy,  although tock rices  ave T s ex a f o e s p h changed  little    balance ince he ast  OMC on s t l F meeting.

I  have  been  giving    lot f hought o he uestion  f hether e are xperiencing a o t t t q o w w e a stock arket  bubble, nd  if  e are,  hat  we should o  about t.  f he arket  were  to  fall  0  or  50 m a w w d i I t m 4 percent,  would  be  willing  o  stipulate  at  here  ad  been  a  bubble!  Now,  if  e invert  hat, I t th t h w t we have  to e  able o  say  before he act  hat  e define    bubble y  being illing  o  forecast at  he b t t f t w a b w t h t market  is oing  down,  say, 0  percent.  hat  is  a  tough  forecast  ake. We  all  ave  our  capital g 5 T om h asset  odels--more  or  less  ophisticated  me  discount  tructures    which  we evaluate  hat  is m s ti s in w going  on  in  the arket--but   truth  e have  to ake ccount f he act  hat  e have  an m in w t a o t f t w international ket  with  millions  f eople ho make decisions  or   wide  range f easons.  t  s mar o p w f a o r I i very  difficult  forecast e arket  when we are ealing  ith  a  huge  number of  money market to h m d w professionals  o know as  much about  what  is oing  on  with ndividual ocks  s  anybody.  These wh g i st a people urrently e  buying  individual ocks t rices  hat  reate    Dow  Jones ndustrial  erage f c ar st a p t c a i av o over  9,000. t s ot hat  hey  are uying  the arket  per  se.  In  the ircumstances,    s  very ifficult I i n t t b m c iti d for s  to udge  whether he arket  is vervalued  nd  is bout o o  down.  One can  readily  ay  that u j t m o a a t g s the quity  remium that ne  derives  rom  a  capital set  odel  is howing  such  and  such  and  is e p o f as m s a low  number historically,  xpected arnings  re  going  up  at n exceptionally  gh  rate,  nd  that thate e a a hi a this  oes  not ake sense ecause  it mplies  hat rofit rgins ill ncrease  ndefinitely.  can d m b i t p ma w i i One make all hose tatements,    I  do,  and  conclude hat  he tock arket  is ignificantly  rvalued, t s as t t s m s ove which  I  do. But  I  ask  myself,  o  I  really ow  significantly  e than he oney managers  who d kn mor t m effectively  termine  he rices  f hese  ndividual ocks?   must  say  that  , oo,  eel    degree f de t p o t i st I I t f a o humility  bout  my present  bility    make such  a  forecast. a a to

The more interesting  estion  s hether,  ven  if  e were  to ecide e had  a  bubble qu i w e w d w and  we wanted  to  let  he  air  ut  f t,  would  be  able o o  it.    am not ure f he nswer.  We t o o i we t d I s o t a have  observed,  n  fact,  hat  etting e ir  ut f he ubble, f  t  xists, uld ell e i t l th a o o t b i i e co w b

counterproductive. annot  be  sure ut  I  suspect  hat  he  fact  hat  he  economy did ot  begin o I  c b t t t t n t unwind after  he ore than  20  percent  tock arket  crash n  October  1987 probably erved o t m s m i s t create  n  upside otential    the ow  of  a  couple housand dditional ints.  s you  will ecall, a p in D t a po A r as soon  as  things  egan  to tabilize, estors ncluded hat  f  his  as  the orst hat  ould appen, b s inv co t i t w w t c h they  should et ack  into he arket.  We  have  had  three r  four imilar isodes,  hough  not f he g b t m o s ep t o t 1987 magnitude, hat  ave  reinforced e iew  that  he  upside otential  his  arket  has  risen. t h th v t p oft m So,  we have  to e  very  wary  of he otion hat    small  25  or  50  basis  oint  ove could ermanently b t n t a p m p unwind  this  ubble.  Unquestionably,  ill o  so  for   short  eriod f  time,  ut  it  ay then erely b itw d a p o b m m set he  stage or   further se  hat  ay in  fact  e  highly estabilizing.  ave  no doubt hat  f  t t f a ri t m b d I  h t i i were  really r  desire  o nwind  a stock arket  bubble,  e could o  it.   have  no  doubt hat    200 ou t u m w d I t a or  300  basis  oint  ise  n he unds ate ould  do  it vernight.  'm ot  sure hat  here  s   point n p r i t f r w o I n t t i a i between,   saddle oint,  here  we could  hit  he arket, efuse t,  tabilize  ,  nd  nothing lse a p w t m d i s it a e would  happen.  There  may be  such  a  point.   don't  now how we would  ever ind t.   am certain I k f i I that f  t  ere  the olicy bjective,   would  fail. i i w p o we

After hinking    great  eal  about his  nd  wondering  how we should ntegrate  is t a d t a i th issue  nto ur valuations,  ave  in  effect  ome out here  Bob McTeer has.  The  question, i o e I  h c w essentially,  hether e have  any  great  nsight  nto ow to  handle sset  alues s  a  part f is w w i i h a v a o monetary  policy. n  principle,   have  to ecognize  hat  sset  alues ave  an  effect,   we have  to I we r t a v h so consider  heir pact  and  we certainly    so  in erms f he ealth  effect.  ut  how we can  alter e t im do t o t w B th pattern  f arket  valuations,    distinct  om  its  ffects   consumption nd  other ectors  f he o m as fr e on a s o t economy,  is omewhat beyond  me. I  have  concluded hat  n  the roader ense e have  to  stay ith s t i b s w w our  fundamental entral  ank  goal,  amely, o  stabilize  oduct  rice evels.  o the  extent  hat  he c b n t pr p l T t t financial rkets  affect  he actors  hat nfluence  roduct  rice evels, hink  onetary  policy ma t f t i p p l I  t m

The third  nd  crucial  ssue  hat  as  come up  today elates   wages  and  productivity. a i t h r to I  agree hat  he CI  has  changed  at  a  far ore modest  pace  than ne  would  have  expected n  the t t E m o o basis f  past hillips  rve  calculations.  t  compensation er  hour  figures  re  running omewhat o P cu Bu p a s higher nd  in  fact  end o  negate he onclusion  ne  draws  from  the CI. So,  there  s n  interesting a t t t c o E i a question  s  to  which  set f ata s  more  appropriate. ere  is o  question  n y mind  that  he CI, a o d i Th n i m t E properly  easured, oes  reflect e  wage structure.  suspect, wever, hat  n  periods  ike  he m d th I ho t i l t present  hen there  re  extreme  shortages  f ertain  kills   the orkforce,    lot f he ncreases w a o c s in w a o t i in labor ompensation re  not  showing  up  in igher ages  for   given ob ut  rather   promotions c a h w a j b in and  the ike  ecause hat s he ay business  irms an  avoid ertain  nternal oblems. he overall l b t i t w f c c i pr T effect  annot e  large,  ut  it  as  to e  of ome size. o,  I  would  be somewhat less  anguine han c b b h b s S s t I might  otherwise  e  about  how good  the  ECI numbers  look, hough  there  s o  way of  getting b t i n around  the act  hat  he age pattern s  been  somewhat subdued. f t t w ha

The more interesting  ta hat  re  beginning  o  emerge  are  those hat  rovide da t a t t p increasing idence  that  he nderlying  rend  f roductivity   oving up. One can  disregard  he ev t u t o p ism t noncorporate  ector, ich  I  think  bnormally onstrains e  number we use  for otal  onfarm s wh a c th t n productivity,   look  at he  area or hich data re learer--that    he onfinancial rporate and t f w a c is, t n co sector.  here  is,  f ourse,    statistical  crepancy  etween  the utput  ata rom  the pending ide, T o c a dis b o d f s s even  if  e make adjustments  or he oncorporate  rea,  nd  the ata rom  the  income side. he w f t n a a d f T advantage f  looking t roductivity  om  the ncome  side,  s  the LS  formerly  id,  s hat  he o a p fr i a B d i t t income side s nternally  nsistent  th  the  price umbers.  The reconciliation m  productivity i i co wi n fro to

I'm ot  saying hat  ne  approach s  superior  he ther s  a e th n n t o i tot o a pure  measure  of roductivity,   I  wanted  to oint ut hat  he ncome  side pproach s n easier p but p o t t i a i a way to  get hrough o  the rice elationships. t t p r

Having  said hat,  he ublished  roductivity  ta or onfinancial rporations ve t t p p da f n co ha shown some modest  decline  ver he  last  hree ears rom  a  3  percent  ate  ver he our uarters o t t y f r o t f q ended  in  the irst arter  f  1996  to  2.7 ercent  or he our  uarters  nded  in he irst arter  his f qu o p f t f q e t f qu t year. owever,  when the  hours ata re  adjusted  or he ength f he ay  period  roblem, he H d a f t l o t p p t comparison everses  ignificantly. tead  f  going  down from  3.0  to  2.7 ercent  ver he ast  wo r s Ins o p o t l t years,  roductivity  owth  goes  up  from  2.7 o  3.2  percent, 2 ercent  eing he taff's imate  f p gr t 3. p b t s est o the  rate  ver he our uarters ded  in  the irst arter  f  this  ear. he first arter  y  itself  s o t f q en f qu o y T qu b ha an estimated  .4  percent  nnual ate  f ncrease  nd  the stimated  ncrease  n anufacturing  or he 3 a r o i a e i i m f t month of  April s 8 ercent.  o,  I ind t ery  difficult  set side he vidence hat  hese ata re i . p S f i v to a t e t t d a indeed  accelerating.

You may recall  he  argument  I  made a  year r o  ago  that  n  explanation  s equired t o s a i r for he  sharp ncrease  n  capital vestment, pecially    high-tech  reas,  hat  tarted   1993 and t i i in es in a t s in has  persisted nce hen.

If  nything, e omestic conomy has  gotten tronger   have  financial o n a th d e s as markets.  Price  ressures  emain  low  to e  sure,  ut  I ontinue  o elieve  hat  his  s ore the esult p r b b c t b t t i m r of  temporary ather  han  permanent  factors.  t ay be  that  he rend  ate  f roductivity  s  risen, r t I m t t r o p ha and  certainly ur  arguments  are  very ersuasive  that, t   wonder  whether roductivity  ll yo p on bu I p wi continue  o  grow at   rate hat  ill ffset flationary ssures emming  from  labor nd  other t a t w o in pre t a resource  onstraints. c

In  my view  monetary  policy  s ccommodative  right  ow. I  do  not hink  hat  o  much i a n t t s because  of he  level  f he tock arket, nd  I  totally  ree ith  you,  Mr.  Chairman, hat  e cannot t o t s m a ag w t w really  arget    particular  vel  f he tock arket, nd  we should ot ttempt  o o  so.  My  concern t a le o t s m a n a t d about  an  accommodative  monetary  policy  s long  the ines  f hat  President ole ust  eferred i a l o w Po j r to as  the osts  f eing rong. I  think  he osts  f ontinuing  ith  an  accommodative  policy re c o b w t c o c w a fairly rge. s asset  rices  scalate, t ust  n  the tock arket  but lsewhere,  heir pact n la A p e no j i s m e t im o resource llocation  n  be  negative.  nd the scalation  sset  rices  an  be  negative  n  terms f a ca A e ofa p c i o its  mpact n  credit  uality,   the inancial ctor  ore generally, d  ultimately    the est  f  the i o q on f se m an on r o real conomy. So,  with  a  continuing  ccommodative  monetary olicy  hat  e are  seeing e a p t w anecdotally,  en  if  e don't  ee  it  n ore traditional sures  such  as  the evel  f he eal nterest ev w s i m mea l o t r i rate,    think  e run he isk  f uilding  roblems  in he  financial ctor  nd  in  the eal  conomy that I w t r o b p t se a r e will ome back  to  haunt s. c u

I  know that  onditions ternationally    very  tenuous.   do  not now,  however, o c in are I k t what  extent  ncreases   our  interest  tes  t his  ime ould  affect  vents n  Indonesia  r ndia r i in ra a t t w e i o I o Pakistan,  lthough   do  agree hey ould have  an  immediate  impact n the  dollar/yen te.   don't a I t w o ra I know how big  it ould  be, ut  it ight  be  troublesome.  t ay be, nd  I  will efer  o our w b m I m a d t y judgment, r.

If   look ack, si B I w a t c o b I b I wonder  how much difference ghter  netary  policy  ould  have  made over he  last  ouple f ti mo w t c o years.  In  fact, oking t  the sian  situation   it  as  unfolded, w much would  tighter nditions lo a A as h ho co here  in  the nited  States  ave  impeded  the low  of ot oney to  Asia  that  urned  ut,  t  least  n U h f h m t o a i part,  o e  the ource f ome of he roblems  in  that  art f he  world? t b s o s t p p o t

MR.  HOENIG. Mr.  Chairman,  I  concur ith  your ecommendation  and  would  like  o w r t make a  couple f  comments. I  am very  mindful f he sian  situation, ugh  I  would  not se o o t A tho u international siderations    a  primary otivation  or ot  changing ur  policy.    think  he con as m f n o I t stability   he .S.  economy needs  to  be  our  foremost  onsideration. ome out his  ay because, oft U c I  c t w as  I  look t he .S.  economy,  I  see   variety  f actors  nfluencing  e utlook  hat o  not aint a t U a o f i th o t d p a clear  icture.  hey do  not rovide n  easily  efined ationale r oving  now.

In  particular, r ei W d t j a  p m I think  e need  to atch  the roductivity  mbers. If  hose oint  o  a  clear  olicy ourse,  e should w w p nu t p t p c w act.

MR.  GUYNN. Mr.  Chairman,  my view  is hat  he ky  probably s ot  falling t. t t s i n ye Certainly,  ere s ome probability  at  e can  slip  y  without    tightening  olicy, t he  odds th i s th w b a ofp bu t appear o  be  growing  on  the ther  ide. ith  all he omments I  heard  in he  first -around, t o s W t c t go I think    identify st  vividly  ith ill  oole's  ssertion  at nflation  pectations,  ile ubdued, I mo w B P a th i ex wh s are  fragile d  that  eople eally  re  counting  n  us  to o  the ight  hing,  ven  if  hey queal nd an p r a o d r t e t s a holler  t he ime e do  it.  lthough  I  feel  hat  e should ighten  oday ased n  domestic a t t w A t w t t b o considerations, rtainly fer  o  you and  others  ho can  better dge ow much weight o  give I  ce de t w ju h t the  fragile  ternational uation.  ving  said hat,  come back  to our eminder hat  hat  eans in sit Ha t I y r t t m

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Meyer.

MR. MEYER. Thank you, r.  Chairman.  Labor  markets re  very  tight,  d  a M a an significant  rt f he  recent  nflation  rformance wes to he emporary ffects   favorable pa o t i pe o t t e of supply hocks.  Inflation  ll lmost ertainly    on a  rising  rend oing  forward,  ut  the ublished s wi a c be t g b p rise  ill e  partially  fset  y  the ffect  f echnical visions. t  me say  a  few words  about he w b of b e o t re Le t stock  arket  and  then sia  and  how they it  nto  he  monetary  policy  alculus. m A f i t c

For  the tock arket,    suggest  wo  rules.  ule  number one  is hat,  eneral, s m I t R t ing monetary  policy hould ocus n our  broad  macro  policy  bjectives,  mely  price tability  d  full s f o o na s an employment. The stock arket  in  this  ase  has  only  an  indirect  fluence   monetary  policy m c in on through  its  ffect  n  aggregate  emand,  with  no  more  influence an   host f ther  actors.  f  he e o d th a o o f I t FOMC is isciplined  out  its  onetary  policy  nd  thereby  ontributes fectively  ward ts road d ab m a c ef to i b macro  objectives,  e  stock arket  in y  view  is ikely  o onverge  back  to  fundamental  alues nd th m m l t c v a to  do  so  in    reasonably  raceful  nd  not  very  isruptive  y should t  rift ay for while. a g a d wa i d aw a

Rule  number two  addresses  he ase  when there  s vidence f   bubble  economy in t c i e o a which  asset  alues re  more seriously retched   both  financial d  real sset  arkets,  s  was v a st in an a m a apparently  he ase n  Japan  in  the ate 980s.  Failure  o  control  uch  widespread ver-valuations t c i l 1 t s o can  risk  erious  isruptions    the eal conomy down the oad. ule  number two  suggests  he  use s d to r e r R t of  monetary  policy  o esist ch  wider  and  more dramatic sset  arket vervaluations.  e art  f t r su a m o Th o

good  policy  s nowing  when to  switch rom  rule ne  to  rule wo. [Laughter]  I  do  not hink  hat i k f o t t t time  has  come yet. evertheless,  en there s n  increased  isk  hat  quities e  significantly N wh i a r t e ar overvalued,  t  ould  be  prudent or onetary  policymakers  o  reassess w disciplined  eir licy i w f m t ho th po really  s nd  perhaps o  err n  the ide f  restraint  en there  s   close all. i a t o s o wh i a c

What about  Asia? Specifically, uld he  FOMC sho t weigh the  global ffects  .S. e ofU monetary  policy?  Applying  my belief   rule  umber one  for tocks,    globally iendly S. in n s a fr U. monetary  policy  s ne  that  nsures  he nited tates  s n  anchor or trong  lobal erformance. i o i t U S i a f s g p This  is enerally  chieved y  promoting rice  tability   maximum g a b p s and sustainable  owth  and  full gr employment at  home. Like  rule umber two, here ay be  exceptions  nd  the cute tage f he n t m a a s o t Asian  crisis ward  the nd  of ast  ear  might  have  been  one.  The recent  ense f ncreased to e l y s o i fragility  the  region  nd  perhaps   greater  ense f  vulnerability he apanese conomy at east in a a s o of  t J e l raises  ome question  bout  whether oday  we are  still    again n  such  a  situation.  other lose s a t or i An c call.

The bottom  line  s hat  his  s   close all  or olicy.    believe  hat  onetary  policy i t t i a c f p I t m needs  to dge  toward  a  tighter ance nd  soon  unless  ither flation  ves still wer  or  growth e st a e in mo lo slows  to  below  trend.  he staff recast ggests  hat  rowth  may slow  to rend  his  uarter  nd  to T o su t g t t q a below  trend  n he econd  half.  hat  would  reduce he isk  f  rising  nflation  ing orward. ut i t s T t r o i go f B such  a  slowdown is ar rom  assured,  nd  even  in he  staff recast,  flation  ifts ward. Asia f f a t o in dr up encourages ome patience. s

On balance   think    would  support    tightening day f  he onsensus ere  there. I I a to i t c w I will se  my energy  today nd  in  the ays  to ome to  try o ove the onsensus n  this  irection u a d c t m c i d unless,  f ourse,  he ata oing  forward r urther alysis  f he  data hange  my view  of  the o c t d g o f an o t c appropriate  olicy.  ut  today   will ccept our  recommendation, r.

As far s  Asia  goes,   don't  hink  he apan roblem  is oing  to  go  away any  time a I t t J p g soon.
