In addition to the point estimates dots, we calculated a range for implied post-liftoff levels As Simon noted, this intermeeting period saw a significant increase in the likelihood market participants place left panel liftoff, as implied by financial market contracts and the Desk's surveys.

The moves in swap spreads have been associated they may be temporary.  For example, the narrowing coincided with increased foreign-reserve manager sales of U.S. Treasury securities-sales that should put upward pressure on Treasury yields-and elevated realized and expected corporate bond issuance, which should put downward pressure on swap rates.  An additional factor cited that may suggest a more persistent shift in these spreads, however, has been an increase in necessary for speculative arbitrage The increase in financing costs is reflected between the three-month LIBOR rate and the equivalent-maturity Treasury GC repo rate, also shown in the bottom-right by the increase in spreads rate the importance of recent narrowing in swap spreads.

As we discussed in June, and as reflected in the June minutes, the Desk will continue to roll bottom-left panel, this is accomplished by placing bids for the SOMA at Treasury auctions equal in par amount to the value of holdings maturing on the issue date of the securities being auctioned.  The bids are allocated proportionally across those securities being auctioned based on the announced offering amounts.

As shown by the black line, over the past three months, payrolls have increased at in the third quarter.  Over the past 12 months, the fallen ¾ percentage point.  The labor force participation rate, middle-left panel, ticked up to 62.5 percent in November.  Over the past moved down 0.4 percentage point, the same pace The unemployment rate, shown in Panel 2, was 5 percent in both October and November, slightly lower than unemployment rate has shown in the 12 months, the participation rate has of decline as for the trend (the blue line).

We anticipated that at an annual quarter.  Since November CPI.  Taking these data be slightly lower than at the time of the Tealbook.  Notably, current-quarter core inflation would be 1 percent rather than 1¼ percent.  The top-right panel shows 12-month changes in total and core PCE prices.  The plotted series end with the staff's estimate for November as of the Tealbook.  With the latest data now estimate that overall PCE prices (the dashed red line) rose only ¼ percent over the 12 months ended in November, just a touch lower than the Tealbook figure plotted.  The solid black line shows the 12-month change in core PCE prices.  Taking into account the CPI and PPI data, we now estimate the 12-month change through November to be 1.3 percent-again, outlook for core PCE inflation over the medium term, to 1.9 percent by 2018.  As can be seen in energy and import prices have held a similar Panel 3 shows the staff's along with a decomposition of the key factors driving the forecast.

Energy is once again the culprit for the near-term to expect overall PCE inflation to move in line with core inflation. As can be seen in the middle-right black next year.  The near-term downward revision mostly reflects lower energy prices than in June; the projection for 2018 is about unchanged.  Panel 5 shows the outlook for downward revision since June.

WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have a question on John's exhibit 4, 'A scenarios in Tealbook A.  As and from your presentation, if I look at the blue dot-dashed line-which also dropping the funds rate by 275 basis points recession.  So it is a combination of these two at essentially 10 or 12½ basis MR. Recession at the ZLB,' which obviously was also in the alternative I read from the text indicates that you are not imposing a zero lower bound, you are not imposing anything-you are actually doing two things with the funds rate here.  You have a baseline assumption about some kind of Taylor rule with inertia, but then you are to show a typical or a strong reaction to the effects.  And then, on the zero lower bound, you are constraining it points.

technical question, which is, I am puzzled by the fact that the red dashed line panel 5 in the exhibit-above above at the zero that way, for example, for 2018.  Even though the economy is is higher.  So I was curious about really what's going on here. I have one with the zero lower bound is almost always-by just my looking at the blue dashed line, which goes against economic intuition.  I understand it is lower bound, but it wouldn't be worse off, the funds rate more related to the box in the Tealbook about the of scenarios, instead of a zero lower bound, you used a negative 50 basis point or a And the second issue, which is kind of effective lower bound, is I would be very interested to see what would happen if, when you do these kinds

December 15-16, 2015

experience in Europe, and in light of what we've us a flavor of, in a like this, if we could go to negative rates.  And if we had a view on how that would pass much of an extra kick would that give us before going to, negative 100 basis point lower bound, given the learned from that, which is reported in the Tealbook, just to kind of give situation through to financial conditions, how say, QE4 or some other tool?

Let me answer your first technical question.  We assume that there is inertial That is sort of what is going on in the blue dot-dash line.  The reason the red line is blue dot-dash line is basically the inertia.  The inertial Taylor rule has a lot of inertia, and it is persistent, so that is why it is above. your first question. MR. ROBERTS. the initial kick-down in the federal funds rate, and then, after that, it just follows the Taylor rule. above the and so you're inheriting zero rather than negative 1, So that was

clear, John? MR. WILCOX.  Is that

Your second question, why not-

WILLIAMS.  It's clear, but it's not satisfactory, really, because if you think about so many times-these kinds of arbitrary 'I am pushing the funds in one, and I am putting inertia in the other,' and you are getting what are nonsensical one path is above the other, even though the economy is worse.  I would prefer to exercise, in which you are really doing something that is I could see what the different outcomes would be if I was trying to do consistent with our views.  But this is something that we can, you knowMR. it-and I have talked about this rate responses that see something like an optimal control apples-to-apples, so that something that is

MR. ROBERTS.  Yes, that's something that we've been thinking about.

WILCOX.  This is pretty simple.  It is a mechanical application of the inertial rule. is simply feeding off a lagged value that's zero when the ZLB is imposed, and MR. The inertial rule

December 15-16, 2015

rule is feeding off a negative number when the ZLB is not imposed.  It, obviously, to do an optimal control version of the same kind of exercise. the inertial would be possible and red line.  If the federal funds rate could go to minus 100, then the outcome would probably be MR. ROBERTS.  So your second question-I would suggest averaging the blue line the somewhere in between where it is when it goes to minus 200 and when it's stuck at zero.

WILLIAMS.  I'm really thinking ahead to, if this really happened, what the costmacroeconomic thought that the effective lower bound was something lower.  You more information in these kinds of scenarios of, 'Hey, if you guys were at 6¼.'  So that's where I'm going with this, thinking ahead to MR. benefit analysis, or at least the benefit analysis, would be in terms of stabilization if we really know, giving us a little willing to go to minus 50, you wouldn't get an unemployment rate of nearly 7, you might get an unemployment rate that peaked the staff analysis.

I'll Committee wants to know is, how much QE MR. BULLARD. Williams on the same exhibit 4, 'A Recession at the Zero Lower Williams, to do this experiment in which trace out the response-I'm not sure that's suggest an alternative experiment, which is:  You do have this constant probability of recession. If a recession occurred in 2016, I think what the

December 15-16, 2015

recession and what does the staff model say about that? 2019 or something like in a much better position, and then presumably you might have to do much less or something like that.  But comparing to something that, you know, we can't do.  So that's kind of would you have to do to mitigate the And then, as an alternative, you assume the recession does not occur until that, when the funds rate is much higher or might not have to do any QE, or otherwise we're distressing.

exhibit 7, which is entitled 'Liftoff' and is about the dollar, figure 2, 'Dollar Moves Start of a Tightening Cycle,' shows the average of past tightening cycles, and the is a depreciation of the dollar in the months following these tightening cycles.  So I thought you were going to show me an alternative of 'what if that happened?'  And that isn't actually the alternative that you showed me On Around the black line declines-which I guess four previous historic scenario in figures 3, 4, and 5 here.  You showed me further tightening.  So I guess- right. MR. GRUBER.  That's

What people probably the risk of the forecast.  But I think you're exactly right, we don't really have a very post-liftoff, and it's possible that it would fall. MR. GRUBER.  I think you're right, your interpretation of the black line On average in previous because tightening likely as you would expect.  Honestly, this are seeing is good idea of what's going to happen to the dollar

that a lot of the action is all pulled forward in financial markets.  Then, after you initiation of the cycle, other things happen in the economy, and you don't know what MR. BULLARD.  Well, one interpretation of this figure 2 is ahead of the tightening cycle because it's get past the those are.

That's in line with our forecast, I would say, with this relatively flat path of the dollar. MR. GRUBER. forecast that another alternative simulation in the Tealbook that highlights the dollar depreciates.  And that's exactly the type of thing that could be reflected in the of past tightening cycles, that the FOMC afterward.  And, as a MR. KAMIN.  President Bullard, I think I would add, exactly apropos of the point you made, that we have possibility that foreign growth is a little faster than we expect, and as a result of that faster growth, the depreciation of the dollar, shown in this average tightening is already built in beforehand, and then new information arises result, the dollar can go up or down.

Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case.  When models in the two core series, core CPI tends to converge to core PCE and not the other way around.  The implication is that we should not take much solace in the higher value for core CPI inflation.

I'm not deeply concerned that such undershooting will cause in inflation, but rather that our attempts to return unemployment to the natural rate above the natural rate, setting off a cycle of corrections that volatility into the economy. But a plausible alternative is that the unemployment rate falls well below the natural a sharp rise will similarly result in overshooting, might induce additional undershooting and overshooting than I would be if I estimate, as my current estimate of the unemployment is 4.7 percent.

second quarter of 2015 does not to be carrying over into the second half of the year.  The evolving data, as well as the most forecasters, suggest that the moderate growth and low inflation registered in carry into the fourth quarter.  Indeed, the average of the Federal Reserve Nationally, the strong real GDP growth registered in the appear consensus of the third quarter will Bank of St. Louis's three nowcasts is 2.3 percent real GDP growth in the fourth quarter.  In short, real GDP growth during the second half of 2015 has not materialized as we in St. Louis expected.  Accordingly, we have reduced our growth expectations further, and we now stand at a real GDP growth forecast broadly similar to private forecasters for 2016, around 2¾ percent.

more accurate during the past three years.  We continue to be more and have penciled in a 4.3 percent unemployment rate for the end of 2016.  We think is 200,000 a month, this would be far above the pace Concerning unemployment, we have been more optimistic than the median of this Committee and, hence, optimistic this is very reasonable provided growth comes in at 2½ to 3 percent for 2016.  This forecast more aggressive than the Tealbook and most private forecasters, but most forecasters have underestimated the pace of improvement in labor market outcomes over the past several years. Should job gains continue to average

We have been expecting oil prices to would declines in careful watching.  I continue to see lower crude oil prices as a is inconsistent to argue that it's both a negative one or the other.  I is a bullish factor for the U.S. economy. Domestic inflation readings continue to be difficult to turmoil in international energy and commodities stabilize and that, given the current pace of increase in other prices, headline inflation return to target rather mechanically during 2016.  This is still our baseline, but further crude oil prices in recent days bear bullish factor for the U.S. economy, as I think it factor when oil prices go up and when they go down.  We have to choose think having lower oil prices

inflation to have, accordingly, moderated our inflation forecast in the current SEP round.  We modest overshooting of the Committee's inflation target, with headline PCE over year by the end of 2016 and stabilizing at 2 percent Committee pursues the appropriate level of policy accommodation over horizon.  The extent of this overshooting has been tempered relative to previous pushed further into the future.  I see recent oil price declines I'm not willing to adjust the forecast further on as of today. Nevertheless, renewed oil price declines may delay the return of headline target.  We still expect a inflation peaking at 2.1 percent year thereafter, provided this the forecast forecasts and, in addition, has been as a downside risk to this inflation forecast, but the basis of the information available inflation forecast is now closer to the SPF forecast than it has been but above is reasonable provided that growth comes in at 2½ to 3 percent Our current the Tealbook.

One caveat to this assessment is that our small business financing contact at PayNet noted a lending index in October.

It's something to keep than our target inflation rate measured by the increase in total PCE prices. experience over some longer period of time.  For the period from 1984 to the present, trimmed mean PCE inflation is about two-tenths higher than both total PCE and core PCE inflation, which are exactly 2.3 percent, on average, over that time period.  So there quite wedge in there, and at least over in mind, as it's higher is predicated on the key assumption that policy rates rise at a very gradual 2 percent inflation target.

inflation has averaged 1.5 percent.  Over this period, we have had 70 less. Developments on the second leg of our dual mandate have been significantly less encouraging.  Inflation has remained persistently below our 2 percent target for six years now despite substantial monetary accommodation.  Since the end of 2009, PCE inflation has averaged 1.4 percent, while core PCE readings on the 12-month change in core PCE.  In only four months has the rate been above 2 percent, and in these four months inflation was 2.1 percent or our target will end any over the medium simulations in the Tealbook, it is noteworthy how tiny fraction of its former self.

Projections in to 10-year-ahead inflation expectation in the Michigan survey average reading over the past 10 years, and the preliminary 2.6 percent.  This edging down in survey measures follows pronounced as swaps, show that inflation compensation has remained near the very the beginning of this year.  Overall, these data, together with the persistent some risk that inflation expectations could roughly half of the SEP submissions now assess to core inflation as tilted to the downside, and, of course, I am among that half. There are also some hints that beginning to have some survey data the Survey of Professional Forecasters suggest that 10-year-ahead inflation expectations edged lower this quarter, although they have remained at or very near 2 percent since the end of 2012.

The recent data on TIPS and nominal Treasury yields, as well low levels reached at underperformance of actual inflation, raise deteriorate.

So I was pleased of recent events has read the Tealbook, I found their version of how economic events might reasonably persuasive.  Real GDP growth seems likely to continue to rise a little seems likely to fall further. Further, as I unfold to be faster than 2 percent in the next few years, aided next year by a pickup in federal spending, and the unemployment rate

In the past month or so, the declined from levels of about $50 per barrel, a value at which stabilize, to under $40 per barrel.  And with inventories high and OPEC no longer acting like a cartel, the price of oil may take longer to stabilize than had been anticipated until fairly recently.

The other key factor in forecasts of both inflation and output remains to be seen to what extent foreign exchange markets have priced in the impact of a possible change in the federal funds rate, a topic we discussed earlier Nonetheless, I believe that inflation is likely to follow approximately the path that the forecast and key elements in the staff forecast.  They are, first, developments rest of the world; second, productivity growth; and third, With regard to the first point, the staff's analysis is slightly more optimistic months ago, with China apparently on the road to a growth rate of 6½ percent positive signs coming out of the euro area, with the staff expecting I'd like to mention three in the r *. economic performance in the rest of the world, than it was a few or more, and with some

The ECB is clearly determined to run an accommodative monetary policy, which is far different than its behavior of a few years ago, and the productivity growth over the period from 2011 to 2014 declined rate of 0.8 percent, mainly as a result of a decline in multifactor only 0.1 percent per annum over that period. the staff estimates that multifactor productivity growth will increase to just 0.3 expected to increase gradually to 0.7 percent by 2018.  This projected multifactor productivity accounts for the bulk of the increase in the staff forecast in returning potential output growth to 2 percent, despite the staff's and everyone else's predictions of continuing declines in Second, structural labor to an average annual productivity growth, which increased at a rate of This year, percent, a rate that is increase in structural labor productivity.  And that increase is critical in close to the labor force participation rate and a slower growth of labor supply.

in reflection of the staff's view that some factors, expansionary to close the output gap as we did the previous A third issue is the increase in the staff's estimate of the Tealbook-consistent FRB/USbased r * estimate.  As shown on page 2 of Tealbook B, this estimate rose from 0.74 percent October to 1.24 percent this round.

In addition, if the to good use, making investments in infrastructure and technology that that would also make the tradeoffs that the economy faces The fact that the modest upward revision in fiscal spending leads to a positive growth outcome takes me to another important point.  We're about the to tell the Congress and the administration what to do.  But fiscal policy has a direct bearing on monetary policy.  If fiscal policy were substantially more supportive than it has been, we have been able to get off the zero lower bound sooner and perhaps be further inevitably, we are hit with another fiscal spending were put will eventually boost productivity, more appealing.  We don't make fiscal policy, but fiscal policy can help significantly in producing growth, and we should consider how best to draw the attention of the policy community to this consequential point.

Israel began raising the interest rate in the target range in price of housing.  That was the appropriate thing to do. and it became necessary I'd also like, possibly for the second or third time, to discuss the frequent every central bank that raised I'm one of those who raised the inevitable mid-2009, when the economy was growing well, and with inflation above large part because of increases in the Then came the euro crisis.  The Israeli economic situation deteriorated, to reduce the interest rate.  So it's not clear to me what the message is of the much-quoted fact

[Laughter]  That would not well mean that the emphasis on the that countries that raise the interest rate from the lower bound later returned it to same token, some years from now, we will be interest rate mean that the rate should not have been reduced, but it might rate having to be reduced by countries that had raised it is misplaced.

Yellen.  To start, let me go back and go a little deeper number have commented on it.  Obviously, the overall tone has soured the previous FOMC meeting.  The attitude has now shifted to an even-lower-for-evenprice outlook. MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you, Chair on the energy sector.  A since longer talked about the disarray in OPEC and the lack of any pretense of a share, and certainly any reduction in supply from Saudi Arabia is going We have all production ceiling.  Market participants that we talked to in the Eleventh District believe that Saudi Arabia is quite content with the results so far of their supply strategy.  They are determined to maintain their market

Russia and Middle Eastern nations, is really not feasible.  So a reduction appears to be unlikely so far. to have to be accompanied by proportionate declines from and that over the five-year average, is now about 300 million barrels globally.  I have talked in the about the daily supply-demand gap.  By the time we end this year, we think think started talking in September we said 2.  At our previous meeting we said something the supply-demand gap is 1.2 million that, by the end of 2016, that gap-it won't be linear, but it will get down to that, we continue to believe that it's probably not going amount of balance and we start working off this inventory. We think that OECD excess inventory, which we measure as the amount of inventory that is past two meetings the year will have averaged a daily supply-demand gap of about 1.7 million barrels.  I when I first lower, 1.6.  We now believe-actually, today-that barrels.  We expect 600,000 barrels a day.  And based on all to be until-as we've said before-if not late 2016, then sometime in the first half of 2017 before daily supply-demand gets into some

it is going to take longer, and is what is spooking the market.  It starts with Iran.  I have always Iran will likely return to the market at some point in the first half of 2016.  Today, they Iranians do with that 2.8 million barrels, but the suspicion is that they're selling supply-demand numbers that I in Iran.  But these are very big numbers, and it has thrown the If we are wrong, though, we are going to be wrong because here is why and here mentioned that Iran was a wild card.  And because it now looks much more probable that sanctions in Iran are going to be lifted, and lifted sooner than the market had expected, we now believe produce 2.8 million barrels.  We've talked to market participants broadly, and we're not sure exactly what the some of it, and they're storing some of it.  We know that it would be their intention to increase their supply to 3.3 million barrels a day.  We also know that they currently have in storage 30 million to 40 million barrels of oil.  So when you talk about those said earlier, they don't factor

structure of this of the rig count cuts and the cap-ex cuts.  But the truth is that have been very slow to materialize, and global production declines have that there have been production increases from the Gulf of project that just got activated.  That went the other way. at the end of the summer, which caused some shale time lag between rig and spending declines and actual it run off, and Another thing we have learned-and this has been interesting about the industry-we've said a lot about all U.S. production declines been slow.  One of the reasons is Mexico, which was a very long-term Also, there was a bump-up in oil prices producers who are very nimble to reinitiate production and sell in the forward curve.  So that created a problem.  There is also a production declines.  Normally, producers don't just shut down a well.  They let they simply don't replace it with new supply.

now finding that these rigs in shale are much more productive.  This is one wells than they may have expected.  So here's what we think is happening.  Because to decline, there is even more pressure domestically to decreaseWhat's happening here is that there is much more pressure on domestic further decline.  It's going to step function.  One of the reasons we are getting more into balance, though, is Also, we're place in which we are seeing productivity growth, for better or worse, and they're producing more from global supply has been sticky and we're all seeing it. producers and their service suppliers, so there's going to be a happen in a demand.  Our estimate is that demand growth in 2015 was 1.5 million barrels a day, so that

ironic to talk about this now, but there is more and more discussion-and it is make sense to me-that by 2018, we may actually get to the point at which we're in having worked off a lot of this excess inventory.  We will see what decisions OPEC going to be a lag to get supply back online in 2018, because a lot of the leery about getting back in.  The irony is that we might get whipsawed, or might have a price shock in 2018-probably not before then, but in 2018 and beyond there is some risk of this.  I have a feeling we're going to be talking about this at this table to domestic supply, and that OPEC might, at a more bankruptcies, restructurings, and so on and so forth-it is going to get worse It is starting to balance, makes then, and there is service providers and the equipment and the labor will have been taken out of commission, and people are going to be we going to be because of the damage that is being done here future date, depending on what happens, reassert itself.  So we will talk about that more.  Not surprisingly, in that regard.

We are in the hospital sector this week-it's a great example.  The hospital sector really I'll comment on the high-yield market, which we talked sector the dynamic is that, because energy is weak, there are more defaults or yield funds others, but an increasing amount of the holdings daily liquidity or even monthly or quarterly liquidity.  And what's happening with weak energy is, you don't sell other stronger credit, which widens high-yield spreads for everyone in the seeing that

We're at risk of that happening again.  If Iran really does come back on, and we have more shocks and this gets worse, we may have more events this last week heading into 2016.  We are of words about the District.  Obviously, these facts-low oil health-care and the leisure-and-hospitality Care Act has been helpful.  Also, the drops in gasoline prices have I'll briefly say a couple prices, a slowing international economy, a strengthened dollar-are not helpful to the Eleventh District.

As in October, such a forecast In particular, the literature very markets will automatically push up inflation.

The consistently This literature has repeatedly shown that it's hard to improve on a forecast headline inflation to the predicts that headline inflation will run below our 2 percent target. shows that adding the unemployment rate or other measures of economic activity alongside lags of core inflation does not notably improve forecast accuracy.

Now, when I was in the tomorrow is going to propose that we increase the federal funds rate.  [Laughter]  I was talking to you during that period, President Williams.  I wanted to address the formulation that in our FOMC statements for some time reasonable confidence that inflation would return to the labor market, we've seen a few signs that wage increases may finally tightening may be local minimum wages that are going into effect some increases by some large, low-wage employers that have been as a reminder that are pretty noisy.

think it's still hard to say anything with great assurance much slack remains, and Jay has already well addressed this point.  Apart from the On the issue of remaining slack, I on how

December 15-16, 2015

regarding wages, we have uncertainties about labor force participation and, things, recent declines in reentry rates from marginally attached workers and those outside continuing questions more generally, the future behavior of those who are currently out of the labor market.  Some have argued that nonparticipants are not a good indication of remaining slack, citing, among other the labor market.

respects, we still have some quite unusual out of the labor force, for example, it's worth noting that the percentage the labor force but continue to want a job is still well above levels that for a decade before the crisis.  And as it's still the case that nearly half the labor force from long-term unemployment will reenter within a year, this large group of those leaving may-and I emphasize 'may'-reflect some additional But we've got to remember that, in many characteristics in the labor market relative to pre-crisis conditions.  On this point of reductions in the reentry rate of those of those who leave prevailed pretty steadily of those who exit persistently slack.

in the percentage of the longrecent decline has basically where we were a couple of years ago.  These are yet more examples showing why I much of what's going on reflects secular changes from what we've seen much will snap back to something more like pre-crisis conditions. An additional point, just to reiterate, is that paying too much attention to a couple of months of data can be misleading.  For example, the recent decline term unemployed finding a job followed an earlier increase, and that taken us to think it's hard to draw too many conclusions from one data series about the labor market.  We still don't know how before and how a literal sense, of course there has taken place is enough to justify raising the federal So has there been improvement in the labor market?  In been.  There's been ongoing improvement for some time now.  The relevant question, to me at least, is whether the improvement that has

After all, our statutory mandate employment, not to promote improved employment conditions.  So the the labor market comes from the other part mandate, that of price stability. funds target as a self-contained one is to promote maximum limit on our efforts to promote further employment in of the dual appropriate to lift off when had improved and there was reasonable assurance that inflation would to the 2 percent objective was, I believe, a logical way of indicating that we had been on both sides of the mandate in the same direction.  There's no justification for promote employment unless that stance would conflict with pose a risk to financial stability that might The formulation we adopted some time ago that it would be labor market conditions return falling short removing accommodation that helps the price-stability side of the mandate or potentially lead to some very negative outcomes for both mandates.

inflation?  Can we have reasonable assurance that, under current target for nearly the whole period since the financial crisis, this Committee has pretty consistently overestimated what inflation will be a year in What about circumstances, inflation will return to 2 percent in the medium term, given that both headline and core have been running below that and that advance?

who have this assurance is that inflation is essentially because of the decline in energy prices and the Phillips-curve relationship will then reassert itself. As I understand it, the basic argument of those currently being held below that level strengthening of the dollar, both of which are presumed to be transitory.  With the output gap presumed to be small and diminishing, a me a plausible hypothesis, but, to be honest, it doesn't seem more than are several reasons of quite different types why the hypothesis may not pan out as That seems to that.

This to the discussions we've been having more or less every meeting for anticipated.  First, even if one stipulates the basic argument, it under current circumstances.  And, as around the table today, this seems a somewhat unusual moment to be asserting reasonable confidence, a moment when people downside risks associated with it.  The recent additional slide in oil prices and expectations of the longer-term effect of longer than had been expected, and some people began making this argument earlier Alternatively, the output gap may be possibility returns us several years now, to which I alluded a moment ago.

lies beneath it.  Here there are two salient points, both of which I and others have the Phillips-curve reasoning empirically for some years now.  While nearly everyone shares the least, a narrowing output gap should lead to more inflation, there intuition for at least a decade, certainly is that the assumption of anchored expectations that plays an the hypothesis is at least a little questionable.  For one thing, both market and the low ends of their historical ranges; while it no convincing theory-much less an A second reason to doubt the hypothesis cuts more deeply into the mechanics of the theory that made numerous times before.  One is the familiar observation that has not fared very well intuition that, directionally at just hasn't been very much observed data to back up that not with anything like the precision that one would hope to find in a theory underlying important policy decisions.  The second point important role in survey measures of inflation expectations are at may be that liquidity considerations and gas prices, respectively, help explain these current measures, their very levels remind us that there's empirically supported theory-of how expectations are formed, how in concrete terms anchored

December 15-16, 2015

It has been remarkable to me to observe how much weight is placed on a concept inflation in the recent past but for which neither future.  It seems at least worth asking whether the persistence of some developments as shocks in the models we use may over time themselves affect maybe the mere persistence of below-stated-target inflation over a period of If Narayana Kocherlakota were still here today, he might add that the might further chip away at the anchor expectations function in the economy to affect inflation, and when expectations may become unanchored. that has worked reasonably well for projecting theory nor practice provides much ground for determining when and how it will continue to work in the that are characterized expectations.  Or years can have this effect. apparent acquiescence of the FOMC in that situation keeping expectations in place.

more fundamental-that is, the models for understanding inflation are missing a different dynamic that as much.  It certainly is not whether a shift in the so-called commodity supercycle, the slowing of phenomena in the sources and path of inflation.  Here, as in many other the financial crisis and Great Recession may have amplified or accelerated changes is no particular reason to believe that the will be any A third reason to question the hypothesis is even possibility that current has taken hold in the economy.  Some academics have argued farfetched to wonder emerging market growth on a secular basis, changes in U.S. labor markets, and other have worked a more basic change areas, already working their way through the economy.  There understanding about inflation developed in the Volcker and post-Volcker periods more lasting than that which prevailed in the pre-Volcker period.

The obvious candidate for a quite different explanation is secular stagnation.  But even short of a theory affecting the entire performance of the economy, something else may be going

December 15-16, 2015

is precisely at times when received wisdom is breaking down that policy missteps look, on, and it in retrospect, most likely to occur.

enough evidence of secular stagnation, or variants is a possibility that a significant shift in how the economy operates-for example, that right now-has way.  This is just another reason why I've been suggesting that we should rely a little that old correlations will reassert themselves and a little more on incoming data that working.  More generally, I don't want to reject what I've termed the Now, I certainly don't think there's thereof, to justify substituting some new theoretical approach to how inflation develops.  But there inflation may be significantly more influenced by secular than cyclical factors been under less on faith actually show they are 'plausible hypothesis' that seems to be motivating much of the Committee.

By the way, no oneme-has been arguing for waiting until inflation actually gets all the way to more a matter of wanting to see data that document the fact that in that direction. Were wage acceleration that seems that inflation was finally returning to the Committee's certainly not 2 percent to begin acting.  It's the trend is me this is a matter of assessing which outcomes are more likely and are of greater concern.  There is surely some chance that if we were to wait, the will prove correct, and we would have to move more quickly to raise rates in the GDP growth running only modestly above its trend rate, this seems to me a fairly modest So, in the end, for which risks hypothesis future in order to contain inflationary pressures that threaten to get away from us.

That's the first time it's been While the effects of the inventory cycle will undoubtedly prove short-lived, the the stronger persistent, as documented in the Tealbook.  The effects of this are already manufacturing by some measures.  I did take some signal from the most recent manufacturing index, which dipped below 50 percent below that mark in three years.

I think the risks to the outlook are mainly about what's happening abroad.  I think those risks are still very much when oil prices are weak and inventories are abundant has provoked another downward movement in oil prices, and this accumulate and exhaust will be set at much lower levels than a year ago.  For WTI crude oil forward prices 12 months ahead are roughly $20 a barrel lower now around $44 a barrel.  You In any case, I think we're going to see a lot more stress on energy producers and major energy-exporting countries in 2016.  The fact is, existing price hedges are running off, and the new hedges, if they are put in place, example, the than they were a year ago, so the December 2016 contract is trading at don't get that much if you sell oil forward anymore.

as a are a number of large-scale mining production that are going to enter the market in 2016.  I think this is going to exacerbate the glut in mind, not only is there a risk of still lower this stress from lower prices is likely to prove persistent for quite some time.  I focus that the more severe the the longer it lasts, the greater the chance of breakage.  That breakage could include If that weakness The stress, I think, on some emerging market economies also has increased further number of other commodity prices have hit new lows.  Also, it's noteworthy that it's not like the supply is not still coming out of Spain-there facilities commodities such as iron ore and copper.  In my prices, but on both the degree of stress and the persistence of stress because I think stress is and large corporate failures, big capital flow reversals, or pronounced currency weakness. were to occur, the degree of stress could increase even further.  For example, currency could exacerbate the burden of dollar-denominated debt, and that would increase the risk of additional breakage.  The result could be a self-reinforcing dynamic that could lead to a much worse outcome than what we currently anticipate.

as one example of this dynamic at work. model-based forecasts that have trouble incorporating these types of I see the financial crisis and the Great Recession In the fall of 2007, we did not appreciate what was going to come our way over the next few years.  As the stress intensified and persisted, more and more things broke, and I think this just shows the limits of reinforcing dynamics.

continue to be less worried than some of us about 2 percent.  There are several reasons for this.  First, I downward forces.  It seems to me that when those move back up. On the inflation side of the ledger, I core inflation being considerably below take some signal from the fact that the trend has been sideways rather than down given the fact that we've had energy prices and non-energy import prices pushing downward, so core inflation has been flat even though we've had these downward forces dissipate, core inflation should that first point.  This to me that inflation will likely rise as that gap is closed by core goods inflation moving the effects of the stronger dollar ultimately dissipate. Second, I do take some signal from the fact that the gap between core services inflation and core goods inflation is unusually wide right now, so that reinforces suggests higher as

think wage trends are consistent with an economy that's approaching full true that wage compensation trends, broadly defined, have not moved much, I do take some signal from what we've seen because it does seem consistent with in which businesses are telling us that it's harder and harder to find people for that I hear the most about.  Also, the fact that the underlying productivity growth trend seems to have fallen.  So the fact wage growth down and the fact that the wage Third, I employment.  While it's up anecdotal reports certain types of positions-'truck driver' seems to be the one there may be offsetting factors holding down wage trends, such as the weak headline inflation trend and that some things that might be pushing nominal

December 15-16, 2015

might be consistent with an economy that is, in fact, compensation trend is broadly stable approaching full employment.

to the fact that the core inflation rate is a bit below 2 percent, which I'm not about, I do have some concerns about inflation expectations.  Some of the surveyticked back up to 2.6 percent in the very low end of the range of recent years. In contrast that anxious based measures of inflation expectations show a slight downward trend, and although the University of Michigan measure over the next five years November, it remains at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of three-year measure of inflation expectations.  So what each individual, we calculate the mean, the median, and the 25th and 75th and all of these measures have dipped past year.  From January, they've declined between 30 to 50 basis points25th and 75th percentile.  What that's telling you is that the left.  And it shift just to the drop in energy prices because, one, energy prices January, and, two, unlike the University of Michigan five-bymeasure, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York three-year measure nearly as sensitive to the changes in oil and gas prices. Most notable to me is the decline in Consumer Expectations.  This is a happens?  For percentile of their three-year inflation density forecast, notably over the that's the mean, the median, and the whole distribution of inflation expectations for these individuals has shifted to the seems hard to attribute this were dropping pretty sharply last five inflation expectations doesn't seem to be

Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer I think this survey actually has a much sturdier methodology for tracking compared with the University of Michigan measure.  The University of survey has been around a lot longer, I know, and that's why we always cite it, but I Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey is actually a better survey.  The sample size I want to point you to the Expectations because inflation expectations Michigan think the

And the question about inflation expectations is better crafted to elicit wellsurvey has a much shorter track of years.  But if it's changes in inflation expectations from cite the University of Michigan measures. is much bigger, and it's so you're following the same people over time, which eliminates a in informed responses about inflation expectations.  We ask about inflation-the University of Michigan survey asks about prices.  Now, of course, the record-it only goes back a couple survey measures that we care about, then there's a good case to put considerable weight on the New York survey results and not just always in some danger of becoming unhinged there's not a slam-dunk case for tightening at this When I put all of this together-no significant change in the growth outlook, considerable risk from abroad, and inflation expectations to the downside-that suggests to me that meeting or, for that matter, concluding that not tightening in September was a mistake.

materialize, so I think it's inappropriate to wait any At the same time, these risks may not longer.  There are always risks, and with the unemployment rate now close to most of our estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate, I don't think we should wait any longer, as long as we believe the economy is likely to continue to grow at an above-trend pace, even if only slightly.

I think the current situation calls for a go-slow strategy until we see either the confidence that inflation will head back to 2 percent over the my SEP submission-only two 25 in 2016, and then, as we get more confident, a faster pace thereafter. So economy's forward momentum is sustained or the inflation outlook evolves in a manner consistent with even greater medium term or both.  That's what I've signaled with the basis point tightenings Thank you, Madam Chair.

Fortunately, that risk now light of the past two monthly reports, which I think everyone would Payrolls grew about 220,000 per month, on average, from about the same solid pace we observed over the past has continued to edge down in recent months, and, at lower than last January and only a shade above the median of level. Let me start the data we had received coming into that meeting might be a sign that a persistent broad-based slowing in the pace of labor market improvement was under seems far less likely, in agree were quite favorable. September through November, and that's 12 months.  The unemployment rate 5 percent, it's 0.7 percentage point our projections of its longer-run sustainable

But these developments, nonetheless, represent a market conditions, in light of ongoing demographically driven declines in their underlying trends.

In addition, wage growth, as measured by the ECI and average hourly earnings on a year-over-year basis, remains soft, suggesting not only that the tight, but that our estimates of the natural rate of number of you mentioned indications of rising wage pressures from your a theme I've also heard in many recent meetings with business leaders.

Housing continues appears drilling should restrain overall GDP growth much less in bottoms out and the sector shrinks.

due to the appreciation of risks to the U.S. diminished since late summer.  Overall, I expect that real GDP growth will to run a bit ahead of potential output growth, thereby generating further improvements Of course, the relative strength of domestic spending is being partially offset by weakness in net exports, and that is a drag that is likely to persist for some time, the dollar and the current weakness in foreign growth.  But the potential economy from global financial and economic developments, although still quite material, at least in my view, have continue in labor market conditions in coming months.

little changed.  For this year, overall PCE inflation appears lower than the staff projected in October.  But March meeting, headline inflation will probably have at that point is likely to be close to 1½ percent, a much of the rest of 2016, I am at least years will return to 2 percent, aided by a further tightening in resource utilization. On the inflation front, during the intermeeting period, the data have been largely in line with expectations.  My outlook is poised to come in a bit below ½ percent, a shade barring some major surprise, by the jumped to around 1 percent on a 12-month basis, as the big declines in energy prices recorded a year ago drop out of the index.  Core inflation touch higher than currently.  Thereafter, although the lingering effects of recent movements in oil prices and the dollar may keep inflation subdued for reasonably confident that once these transitory influences finally dissipate, inflation over the next two or three the decision at this that current economic conditions and the outlook, taken together, Three seen further market, and I'm reasonably confident that inflation will rise to 2 liftoff that we announced back in So what does all of this imply for monetary policy?  With regard to meeting, my own judgment is now warrant a modest increase in the target range for the federal funds rate. considerations lead me to this conclusion.  First, as I just noted, we have improvement in the labor percent over the medium term.  Thus, the two conditions for

December 15-16, 2015

met to my satisfaction.  Second, monetary policy operates with a objectives risks because we might be forced to tighten abruptly.  And, remain appropriately accommodative if we in the unemployment rate would be desirable both to help take up that remains and to speed the return to 2 percent inflation. March have now been substantial lag, and waiting to act until we're closer to achieving our dual disrupting the economy in the future finally, and very importantly, monetary policy will do decide to raise the target range by 25 basis points.  This assessment primarily follows from my judgment that a further fall the labor market slack real federal funds rate roughly 100 basis points below the equilibrium rate, as little below 1½ percent.  Simulations of the FRB/US model this level for a couple of years would be expected to push the needn't be in a hurry to close the real federal funds rate gap, as the risk of excessively the federal likely have to rise gradually over the next few years even if we were to decide is appropriate to keep the gap between the real federal funds rate and the equilibrium rate A simple back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the effective stance of policy after liftoff should help to produce these conditions without being overly stimulative.  Let's assume that the equilibrium real federal funds rate is currently about zero, consistent with the analysis presented at the October meeting.  Increasing the target range by 25 basis points would, therefore, leave the core inflation is currently running a and the Laubach-Williams model suggest that keeping the gap between the real federal funds rate and the equilibrium rate constant at unemployment rate only ¼ to ½ percentage point or so below its longer-run sustainable level, all else being equal, providing a modest boost to inflation.  This simple calculation suggests to me that we overheating the economy seems low.  That said, our economic projections imply that funds rate will that it constant.

Furthermore, taking a cautious approach to tightening remains light of the And, finally, we should proceed cautiously in light of heightened uncertainty about effects of higher interest rates.

this increased uncertainty reflects the fact that our monetary policy is now world, and, as a result, we may see unusually Other sources of increased uncertainty are the changes that have credit availability, capital standards, and other aspects of the system, which may have reduced the sensitivity of aggregate activity to interest rates. the response of financial markets to a change in In part, atypically diverging from that of the rest of the large exchange rate effects. occurred over the past eight years in financial And the taper tantrum episode reminds us that policy can be hard to predict.

Of beyond next year despite further improvements in the labor market and no special transitory factors were in play, then, in my view, a potential would surely be in order.

So, let me stop there with those comments.  I think we have time to turn to Thomas for his briefing on monetary policy alternatives before we break for dinner.

Just as important, as you emphasized in your discussion at meeting, is that tomorrow's statement effectively communicate the Committee's current thinking about economic conditionality of the expected policy rate in the handout provide options for addressing these two issues.

On inflation, prices and prices of nonsomewhat different perspectives on recent the fact Alternatives A, B, and C offer somewhat different combinations of assessments of current and expected economic developments bearing on the Committee's decision on the policy rate.  As indicated in the box at the alternatives intermeeting period and say that those developments confirm an appreciable improvement both alternatives B and C characterize inflation as continuing to run below the Committee's objective in part because of declines in energy energy imports.  However, they offer movements in measures of inflation expectations.  Alternative B highlights that market-based measures are low and that survey-based measures have 'edged

respectively, as having down,' while alternative C characterizes those measures, 'stabilized' and having 'generally remained stable.'

that inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term as further.  And, in announcing the policy action in paragraph 3, both that forecast.  However, alternative B cautiously.  Alternative B retains the final sentence of paragraph 2 in the Committee continues to monitor inflation And paragraph 4 emphasizes the Committee's intention to actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. In describing the outlook for inflation in paragraph 2, both alternatives B and C reaffirm the expectation the transitory factors currently holding down inflation dissipate and the labor market strengthens alternatives express reasonable confidence in includes a couple of indications that the Committee is viewing the outlook for inflation October statement, which says 'the developments closely.' carefully monitor

A says that the Committee is not sufficiently confident in the outlook to warrant a change in the target range for the federal funds rate.  In the funds rate unchanged, the Committee would cite inflation expectations.  Paragraph 1 reports that the current shortfall of percent is 'only partly' attributable to transitory factors.  Paragraph 2 that too-low inflation might persist by saying that the temporary the Committee sees a need to 'closely monitor' measures of both actual and inflation.  If it were to adopt alternative A, the Committee would drop the communicated in March.  Instead,  it would say that how target would depend on 'realized and Alternative for inflation explaining the decision to leave 'subdued' inflation, core inflation, and gains in labor compensation and 'low' measures of inflation from 2 suggests a risk factors holding down inflation will 'eventually' dissipate; paragraph 2 also reports that expected criteria for liftoff that it first long to maintain the current federal funds rate expected' progress toward its maximum employment and inflation objectives, and it would add that it is prepared to provide additional accommodation if incoming information does not soon indicate that inflation is moving up toward 2 percent.

Then, in B describes the Committee's expectation that 'economic will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the 'only' in paragraph 4. funds rate is likely to longer run.' The box at the bottom of exhibit 1 summarizes how alternatives B and C communicate the Committee's forward.  Paragraph 2 of alternative B indicates that the Committee's economic outlook is consistent with 'gradual' paragraph 4, alternative conditions federal funds rate.'  By contrast, alternative C refers to 'appropriate' rather than 'gradual' policy adjustments in paragraph 2 and omits the Both alternatives state the Committee's expectation that 'the remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the of future adjustments to the target range' will depend on expected economic conditions relative to [the Committee's] objectives' will depend on the informed by incoming data.' Both alternatives underline economic conditionality by saying, in paragraph 4, that 'the timing and size 'realized and and then adding that 'the actual path of the federal funds rate economic outlook as

This message in the upper-left panel of exhibit 2, is most recent policy projections, the green diamonds. modal expectations in the primary dealer survey.  Based on these is expected to increase only about 50 basis points over The next exhibit financial markets.  Recall that in March 2014, you first introduced statement language indicating that federal funds rate below has been reinforced over the past year by your SEP submissions as well as other communications.  The median of primary dealers' modal expectations for the path of the federal funds rate, shown by the blue dots very close to the median of your In contrast, the policy rate path derived from OIS quotes continues to run well below the median of quotes, the federal funds rate the first year following the onset of tightening.  But, as discussed in a box in Tealbook B, this gap does not necessarily imply that the modal outlook for the federal funds rate embedded in these quotes is much different from that of the dealer survey or the SEP.

point to an expected pace of at the onset of tightening in early market participants of your intended strategy depends on the expectation is predicated.  While we do not two panels, taken from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, these forecasters assign the highest probability to outcomes similar to that these panels are a little adventuresome, so let President Evans on the these panels have on the viewer.  Each column here essentially represents most recent one being the right-most column, and the height each of these columns represents the probability mass right edge of the middle-left panel shows that forecasters currently see GDP outcome, light blue portion at the right edge of the middle-right panel shows that they inflation next year falling in the 1 to 2 percent As shown in the upper-right panel, market quotes tightening that is substantially slower than it was 1994, the blue line, and mid-2004, the red line.  Whether this observation indicates a correct understanding by economic conditions on which this observe the expectations for economic outcomes on which these market quotes are based, the middle suggest that those in your SEP.  I was advised me just quickly say that I will certainly check afterward with effects that an SPF vintage, with the of the bars of different colors in placed on the outcomes being shown underneath.  In particular, the dark blue portion at the growth over the year ahead in the 2 to 3 percent range as the most likely while the similarly place highest odds on PCE range.

Similarly, the the SPF respondents place on real GDP growing faster than 3 percent or each.  A more robust It therefore seems plausible that if the economy evolves in with the median SEP outlook, market participants would be unlikely to alter their expectation of a tightening pace of 50 to 100 basis points per year.  By contrast, how market expectations regarding the path of the policy rate would adjust were to surprise is less clear.  Particularly striking to place on the federal funds rate lower-left panel shows the probability distribution for three-month LIBOR at the end of 2016 implied by options on Eurodollar futures.  The implied probability that pace of tightening will exceed 150 basis points odds that inflation exceeding 2 percent are also about 20 percent

The data convincingly support this decision, according to the conditions out.  Job growth has come in stronger than expected, and broad measures underutilization have continued to improve.  It employment next year by even more than I had anticipated just a few the next couple of years. Incoming price inflation data remain low, but this weakness largely reflects dollar appreciation and declines in energy and commodity prices.  These transitory factors should dissipate as labor markets really start to be stretched next year, and I'm confident that inflation will move back to our 2 percent target over

I because of its important medium-term  * measures are at zero or below, and the statistical models suggest low-inflation risks, I inflation for signs toward 2 percent.  After all, we know how to raise rates if inflation heads too high, but much if we face renewed disinflationary pressures.  But the I find today to be a tough call.  I think the risk-management case for delay until mid-2016 remains strong.  Core PCE inflation continues to run well below our 2 percent objective.  Some of our best r they could be very low for a long time.  In a global environment full of think uncertainty arguments weigh strongly for further delay while we monitor of revival we don't like our toolbox nearly as

December 15-16, 2015

argument for alternative A today is that most of our recent monetary policy Committee have signaled that data conditions and our outlook have met big weakness in the communications by this the threshold for liftoff.

me as long as our first move is accompanied by a that indicates that our initial adjustments will be gradual.  This strategy on further confirmation that we are the medium term.  I believe that alternative B as Acting today seems appropriate to communication strategy also needs to be clear that the path is state dependent, based on track to achieve our dual-mandate goals over written provides this clarity and strikes a reasonable balance among competing concerns.

language in paragraph 4 stating that the means the Committee needs to give special consideration to it seems about as close as Another important feature in alternative B is the shortfall of inflation from 2 percent actual and expected progress toward our inflation target.  This language recognizes reality.  It acknowledges that the main challenge we face today is getting inflation back up to target.  It appropriately emphasizes our concern over this policy shortfall, and we can get today to saying that we are committed to a symmetric inflation target.

that much harder for us to ever achieve our policy mandate.  Most of us have said that Let's make sure we also act as if we do.  And I As I've discussed here many times before, if we act as if our target is actually a ceiling, it will be all we think we have a symmetric inflation target. hope that we will talk more about symmetry in January during the annual review of our longerrun goals and policy strategy.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Rosengren. CHAIR

it is appropriate to get off the zero should continue to contemplate. MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as written.  It is positive news that the economy is finally at the point at which lower bound, a point we

December 15-16, 2015

certainly improved, and it was good news that the past two the labor market.  However, as I is that inflation does not rise to 2 percent as similar to the comments that President Evans just made. Labor markets have employment reports have been so positive.  I am reasonably confident that inflation will reach 2 percent, at least in part based on the current tightness in highlighted yesterday, the biggest risk to my forecast anticipated,

I would suggest that we continue along that path only as our inflation target will be met improves from reasonable to high.  Since I expect evidence of movement toward our inflation target to be slow, I am quite comfortable incorporates only a gradual increase in rates.  If we don't move As we raise rates, confidence that our the tangible with a normalization path that from reasonable confidence to high confidence, I could easily imagine a pace of normalization slower than in my SEP.

the path, and I am confident that it is appropriate to raise at this meeting.  Thank you, Madam Chair. Today we do not need to decide the target range for the federal funds rate

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer. CHAIR

I favor raising the target federal funds rate to a range of the FOMC has not raised the federal funds rate for nearly more than 7 years, and because it crisis of the past 80 goes beyond the impact that would be expected of a 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate in more normal circumstances. MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I'm afraid I'm going to make a longer statement, but with the same result. 25 to 50 basis points.  Because 10 years, because the rate was at its effective lower bound for was reduced to its present level at the height of the worst U.S. financial years, this move has acquired a significance that on the basis is the beginning of the process of normalization monetary policy.  As the Chair and other members of this Committee have emphasized, most The decision is significant also because it of

December 15-16, 2015

the FOMC expect that the normalization process will be gradual.  But we are all the process will be data and outcome dependent, and that if prices and than we currently anticipate, the future path of the interest we now anticipate.  We should and do emphasize, no less, that if the falters and prices and employment increase more slowly than we currently anticipate, rate will be shallower than we now anticipate, and shallowness possibility that the interest rate path may reverse its slope. members of quick to add that employment increase more rapidly rate will be steeper than economy the future path of the interest includes the making in a few hours.  I thought as I listened it was a privilege to be a member of this Committee as we discuss the nation's monetary is appropriate to the significance of our task.  For that thanks not only to one another, but also and particularly to the Chair and to Yesterday, colleagues around the table made impressive presentations, setting out some of the downside risks of the decision we will be that policy with a seriousness and a level that we owe and express the staff.

March that we would move to raise interest rates as long as labor market would return to its 2 percent target level over the medium term.  I believe the medium relationship will reassert itself, and I think we are beginning to see some We said in conditions continued to improve and when members of the Committee were reasonably confident that inflation those conditions have been met.  This conclusion depends on my belief that, over term, the Phillips-curve signs of that in the behavior of labor compensation, but only faintly so.

the expected rate of think that the very long actual inflation rate has been well below the target level of 2 percent. Seven, many colleagues are concerned about indications that inflation has declined somewhat during recent months.  I am also concerned, but I more significant phenomenon is how little expected inflation has declined over the period that the

economy has, during the course of the past year, withstood powerful has that have stayed close to 2 percent. Eight, the headwinds and continued to increase employment, with a core PCE inflation rate that remained above 1 percent and expected inflation rates economy has done a superb, albeit not perfect, job in the continuing task of more normal labor market.  And I believe we will, over the medium term, return to rate and to a situation in which the interest rate will again play of resources, including the allocation between financial activities and In sum, our restoring a the vicinity of our target inflation its role in the allocation real investment.

now?  Why not wait longer?  First, as the Chair has emphasized, our actions accumulating financial stability reinforce the fact that our economic continuing to normalize. Why move become effective with a lag.  Second, there are some signs of problems.  And, third, the signal we will be sending will situation is that might drive us off track and to more likely to continue along a to contend It is, of course, our duty to consider the many ways our expectations could be driven off track, but we also have to assign probabilities to the shocks our ability to deal with them.  My conclusion is that we're positive track and to withstand the negative forces with which we will certainly have as events unfold and which may temporarily drive us off course.

briefly, to a few issues that continue to crop up.  First, are we and will remain in good shape so long as we successfully manage I believe we're doing now.  And, no, because there is no intention of 80 years ago. I'd like next to turn, but about to repeat the experience of 1936 and 1937, as one hears?  No.  The financial system is currently in good shape financial stability, as tightening fiscal policy, as was done

December 15-16, 2015

we too late to move?  No.  The financial system is basically in good shape, signs of instability in very localized instances, and employment Then we can reduce the interest rate.  I do not that we will have to do that, but I do believe we need to reconsider the argument that we zero lower bound because if we try to get away from it, we will have to return be a possibility for any country that decides to raise the interest rate above is not enough to give an example of countries that have had to return to the expected value of trying to move away versus the zero lower bound forever, for the outlook is positive, and positive shocks also happen even Second, are although there are some continues to grow.  But what if growth ceases? expect should stay at the to it.  That will always the ZLB, for negative shocks happen.  But that possibility should not keep us at the zero lower bound forever.  It zero lower bound.  One has to consider the expected value of staying put.  The possibility that we will have to move back should not keep us at the if, by definition, we do not know when shocks will happen.

too fragile a state for us to move?  Most of the rest of not doing well, but this economy has succeeded in increasing employment at a rapid of foreign countries will increase in 2016.  Further, the exchange rate will cease it could be soon. Third, isn't the rest of the world in the world is rate despite the appreciation of the dollar and the decline in net exports.  Expectations are that the growth rate appreciating at some point-and we saw some suggestions yesterday that act as the lender of last resort in a crisis and the shortage of policy tools to deal with topics we will need to address in the period role of forward guidance, the monetary mechanism toward which we are I believe that as we look to the future, we should address several worrisome developments with respect to our ability to do our job, particularly the constraints placed on our ability to financial stability.  There are other monetary policy ahead, particularly the evolving, and the possibilities of finding new tools to deal with the zero lower bound.

stability.  The journey is difficult and we need to remember the warning sent by the fact that there was a financial crisis that began in September 2008. So, to conclude, we're setting out on a new journey with the same goals we've always had-maximum employment, stable prices, and financial daunting, but we can take some comfort from the successes of Federal Reserve policy since the end of 2008, even while global time, a world that, after the into the modern world economy and the likely entry down the road of into the modern world economy, the world may well be more like the world economy of we expected just a few years ago.

But we have I expect that we will to do our job well, and that the decision we are likely to take today will be part of doing job well.  Thank you, Madam Chair. Of course, we are not course, we do not have some of the tools that we a job to do-monetary policy-and we have the tools to manage it. continue that

looks as though it will set up an expectation of rate increases on a every other meeting.  The word 'gradual,' used twice in the alternative B statement, move in January is a The SEP dot chart schedule of will, to some extent, take its definition from the SEP.  So, assuming a virtual nonstarter, which I do, the expectation will be for a second policy rate move in March.

of an 'eyes wide open' approach, I think it's worth considering what we will time of the March meeting.  We will have the February CPI data arriving on the inflation this juncture, I have no reason to dispute the might have a small uptick in the raise the policy rate a second time in March seems to me. In the spirit likely know at the the second day of that meeting.  We will have PCE price data only through January.  With the continuing softness in oil, gasoline, and commodity prices, it seems to me likely that data we will have in hand will be very weak.  The Tealbook, in fact, suggests zero for the headline inflation number for the first quarter.  At Tealbook projection.  The Chair pointed out yesterday that we year-over-year headline and core PCE readings because January 2015 was extremely weak. Even so, an inflation-data-dependent decision to could be problematic, it my comments, I support the statement as written. concerned about how we will operationalize the criterion of actual and of next year.  I doubt we will have made.  We may have more on employment data, along with the faith-based expectations drawn from our the actual, inflation As I said at the beginning of Nonetheless, I'm a little expected progress toward our inflation goal in the early part inflation statistics that are supportive of a conclusion that progress is being to rely once forecasts.  The emphasis may have to remain on the expected, rather than evidence.

a small one, really:  It's one thing to project from the SEP exercise a another thing to My overall point is forecast-based median level of the funds rate at year-end 2016.  It may well be

December 15-16, 2015

in real time, especially in March, before those forecasts have had ink is long dry on today's statement, we may well be advised to make post-liftoff rate decisions much validation.  So before the start thinking about how to make subsequent policy decisions and, very importantly, how to communicate the nuances of data dependence when the data are less complete or more ambiguous than we would like.

MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  For convinced that economic conditions This was based on a sense that labor constitutes full employment and on confidence that inflation will move back to 2 percent once the most recent disinflationary impulse has passed.  Since then, as I discussed in our round, the economic reports for the So I continue to see a rate increase as well justified, and I support alternative B.  It's great to be able to market attention is going to focus on in the statement regarding the prospective funds rate path.

As a result, market 'gradual' in the statement.  As drafted, the statement does a great job of that. twice-once in paragraph 2, in which policy,' federal funds rate.'  These are both new elements.

As we saw yesterday, markets already expect a funds rate path substantially below the path embodied in the median SEP or the staff's forecast.  And according to the Tealbook, the market's uncertainty about the pace previous tightening episodes, and I thought that circumstances, we should avoid pushing down market expectations of the willing to support the statement as written.  However, I running a risk here of exacerbating the disconnect between the market's expectations Under those funds rate path even further, but I'm think we're of the funds rate path and ours, and I hope that doesn't happen.

If anything, based on the Tealbook's assessment of rates, I think it would be worthwhile to encourage I also see a risk that emphasizing a gradual path could reinforce the excessive sense of certainty in markets expectations if the economic outlook starts to change materially in either direction, as Fischer emphasized. incoming data whenever Lockhart discussed, which refers to the current shortfall of inflation from a constructive element that does so. market's responsiveness the market's current lack of uncertainty about markets to be less certain about the future path of rates.

As everyone will have inferred from remarks yesterday, I don't think it's inclined toward the reasonable confidence that inflation with the further declines reading earlier in the week, and the number of concerns expectations.  In light of the number of important questions have changed in recent years, as well as about prudent for the Committee patterns and these patterns may reemerge, but it's far from certain.  And with is not running very hot but with an think it wise to be certain of the directions of inflation and the economy before raising rates, thereby of this latter eventuality.  My policy preference is captured fairly well Again, I don't deny that numerous tightening tools available in an economy that unappealing set of options were more accommodation to be needed, I particularly diminishing the chances

I've past that one shouldn't follow through on an ill-advised policy just because one has that policy, but I have to admit that, at this point, the credibility of the is at some risk since many in the markets and the public believe that the FOMC promised Of course, I've asked myself what the best argument for acting today is and have listened to or read the views of many others on this topic.  It seems the best reason to act economics we face at today's meeting, but in the fact that many on the Committee and, recently, a particularly noted in the said one might adopt FOMC September, then didn't act, and has now promised December.

to be pushed into action through arguably premature or overbroad public myself at this meeting, I wasn't a part of this, and, as many will references to This poses some disturbing institutional issues-most important, the question of whether the Committee is statements.  That is an important issue, and maybe it should bear discussion at some point in the Committee.  But, speaking for recall, I've advised against this pattern of frequent public comments with frequent particular meetings.

B today for two reasons. there is the institutional reality that there's enormous significance attached out there to a the Chair's position.  Perhaps this shouldn't be this way and might be better off with the culture of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, reality is what it is.  This moment of liftoff after seven years would be a particularly bad time thereby risk the Chair's leadership position at a critical moment in may face some considerable challenges in the months ahead. Despite all of that, I will reluctantly go along with alternative First, member of the Board voting against we but to enter a dissent and monetary policy, which

I requested such language and feel that its inclusion my going along with what is a broader policy orientation than just the yesterday, the transitory factors hypothesis is Second, the not just for is presumptively gradual and, with the addition of the language on inflation to paragraph 4, emphasizes what I've been suggesting-that is, it pays particular attention plays provides some basis for federal funds rate increase.  And, as I suggested plausible.

After all, even though I do think some secular changes in the economy may be playing an important inflation, my baseline expectation is still for a gradual upward movement next year.  Because of the questions that expectations right now.

I had written this out last night, and I crossed it out other comments, I recognize that others may may be left concluding at a future meeting that faith has trumped empirics too much. confess, I already hear some effort to undermine the language that has been inserted, so have some differences with the majority of the Committee in I was going to omit this this morning.  But, having just listened to several differ, and I I have to I'm afraid I do anticipate that I may the future.  I hope not.

would not I have one final point, though.  My focus on evidence and pragmatics is not one way.  It's not a position of principled or devoted dovishness.  If, for example, inflation were to begin moving well ahead of what the Committee expects in a way that suggested a trend, I

I never thought that it's a particularly good idea to remove the kind the point of a decision.  Thank you, Madam be averse to economy in some pretty basic ways over the past actually would not want any stronger language in the statement committing us to a gradual approach or of optionality that one wants to maintain up until Chair.

Yellen.  I am in favor of alternative B as written.  I is time to begin the process of normalizing policy, and I am very mindful of the fact, as monetary policy operates with a lag. MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you, Chair believe it we have discussed, that we will likely need to maintain some level of accommodation for some severe overcapacity in China, which will likely push down rates of growth there for some extended likely to negatively affect workforce need to be primarily supported by I do believe period because of slower growth outside the United States-in particular, and overleverage period; aging demographics in the United States, which are participation rates; and, in addition, the end of the so-called debt supercycle globally, which means that if there are debt increases in the future, they will income growth.

our that this means we are likely to remain accommodative even after this increase, and more moves, that still means we have some degree of In light of all of these factors, though, I agree with the plan to remove accommodation gradually and assess and reassess conditions as we go.  I also agree with the tone of statement and ongoing communications, which emphasize our intention to move gradually; an explanation that, even after a couple of

I'm heartened by the continued progress on getting Americans back to work and by the prospect workers back into the labor force.  By contrast, I'm uneasy about the mandate, and it would be difficult for me to point to any developments in the intermeeting period that have raised my confidence two to three years.

December 15-16, 2015

inflation has averaged below 1.5 percent.  As this is despite monetary accommodation and a substantial gain in resource utilization, it really does curve is inert.  In addition, I'm troubled by hints that the persistent yesterday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York surveys-have drifted lower. For six years now, PCE substantial suggest that the Phillips underperformance of inflation may be having some effect on inflation expectations.  Although previously, survey data had remained fairly steady, recent readings of both the Survey of Professional Forecasters and the Michigan survey-and, of course, as Vice Chairman Dudley pointed out This follows a pronounced and persistent deterioration in market-based measures.

while the risks to domestic activity look relatively balanced, I am wary complex of and metals prices ongoing risks to a broader set of emerging markets, which are confronting challenges terms-of-trade deterioration, weak growth risk of further bouts of currency volatility or pressure on these economies. Moreover, regarding the fact that that foreign developments could continue to pose downside risks to economic activity and financial conditions.  China is in the midst of navigating a difficult cyclical and structural challenges.  Recent further sharp declines in oil underscore of their own that could be exacerbated by further prospects, and difficulties associated with elevated debt burdens.  It would be unwise to dismiss lightly the that there are important risks on the other side-in particular, inflationary pressures may emerge with greater force than is expected today.  As I risks on both sides, the combination of asymmetrically greater room to through conventional means; core inflation stubbornly below its target, with from abroad associated with tightening too I'm also mindful of the fact the risk that take into account the tighten than to ease the deterioration we've seen in inflation expectations; and downside risks arising leads me to place somewhat greater weight on the possible regret

December 15-16, 2015

than on the possible regret associated with waiting a little longer to see some of these risks early play out before moving.

course, that many other members of the Committee, after lengthy same risk-management great care in what we communicate about the path forward.  Let me in light of the persistent low readings on inflation, the when it's very important to me to emphasize that future importantly shaped by the credibility of our commitment to move monetary policy in lot of weight on the language that calls out inflation developments and toward our 2 percent goal as importantly influencing the stance of future policy. I respect, of deliberations, have come to a different conclusion.  In that context, those considerations argue for highlight three specific aspects.  First, deterioration in measures of inflation expectations, and the fact that we will be lifting off actual inflation remains well short of our goal, monetary policy will be inflation back to our target.  In our discussion of the likely future path of paragraph 4, I put a progress combination of a low neutral rate with slow progress on inflation suggests a effective lower bound than in previous decades, when the lower the longer-term nominal be to push growth below potential to necessitate a nominal federal funds rate well below zero to interest rate levels above it.  As the probability of effective lower bound increases, that asymmetry in our flexibility becomes more Second, the greater likelihood of hitting the nominal neutral interest rate was probably much higher.  The neutral rate is, the smaller in magnitude an adverse economic shock must sufficiently provide accommodation.  As a result, monetary policy is likely to remain more constrained at the effective lower bound than to be operating at hitting the pronounced.

reason, it's very helpful that the statement provides additional guidance reinvestment policy.  The language in the fifth For this reflecting the Committee's consideration of our

December 15-16, 2015

monetary policy initially will rely primarily on the funds rate-our best-understood shocks through paragraph clarifying that the Committee anticipates continuing reinvestments 'until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way' helps clarify that future changes in and most tested policy tool-and will provide more room to respond to negative conventional monetary tools.

very important to communicate that, based on our understanding of the and move to a lower level than has been the tightening cycles.  Recent research by the staff and others has shown that the current low by historical standards and has persisted at a very low level for Furthermore, persistent changes in demographics, productivity growth, risk future.  As the public the effects likely be and low path' message should help reduce the tantrum' reaction to liftoff-a reaction that could slow progress toward both of these reasons, I place a lot of weight on the message that the pace of Finally, it's neutral rate, the path is likely to be more gradual case in past neutral rate is extremely some time. premiums, and foreign growth suggest that it may remain at a low level well into the these circumstances are highly unusual, it's necessary to communicate to they will have on monetary policy-namely, that normalization of the policy rate will more gradual than in previous tightening episodes and likely move to a longer-run policy rate below historical norms.  Moreover, the 'gradual risk of a 'tightening of our goals.  For all normalization is likely to be gradual, albeit data dependent.

staff, as well as the thoughtful approach of the Chair and the Committee many months to ensure liftoff is operationally well managed and to align public reaction function and outlook.  At this critical juncture, Let me conclude by saying I appreciate the careful and exhaustive preparations that have been undertaken by the over the past expectations with the Committee's policy I place a very high premium on ensuring the credibility of monetary policy and demonstrating

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bullard. CHAIR

today.  I'm to comments that have already been made.  Generally speaking, I think Chair, for maneuvering position. MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B for going to react a little bit we're in good shape for this meeting, and congratulations to you, Madam us into this labor markets are largely healed, certainly as measured the level of the labor market conditions index the Board staff has, you will find that that index is well above its average level since 1976. My basic position has been that by the unemployment rate.  Also, if you look at that

think that inflation can be interpreted as more or less soft but as only a little bit price shock that we're dealing with globally.  I interpret that oil disrupting inflation data. I also below target net of the big oil price decline as great news, really, for the U.S. economy ultimately, even though it's our interpretation of the

I agree with the staff judgment that, in 2016, economies' growth will improve to 3½ percent, and advanced foreign percent.  Obviously, forecasts are forecasts, but that's We're actually very close to our goals on both employment and inflation if you take the interpretation I'm suggesting.  Internationally, emerging market economies' growth will increase to 2 probably the best judgment about what's going to happen globally.

I think sending negative economy. For these do think it's economy, and I agree with President signals has plagued us since the end of the recession.  We've been worried about the

we can say we do see healing and we're willing to acknowledge a better performance than years ago, that's a positive thing for the U.S. economy.  We'll see how That worry has transmitted into private-sector expectations and perhaps been damaging.  So, when what we had a couple of that plays out once we get going here.

inflation to be a cap, and I don't think most people on the Committee think as a cap.  So I agree with the idea that we should emphasize the symmetry commentary.  I do feel very strongly, however, this should be a forward-looking statement, because that's the way the Committee has low side, but we've missed to the high side, arguably also because of commodity price movements, we repeatedly we think inflation is going to come I agree with President Evans on the symmetry argument about inflation.  I've never considered 2 percent of the 2 percent target of our inflation target.  We do that in our public that behaved in the past.  In the current era, right now, we've missed to the repeatedly said we think it's going to come back to target.  Similarly, in the 2003-07 era, when we said during that era, 'Yes, we've missed to the high side, but back to target.'

the Committee actually behaves, the number of misses on one side really the big factor.  The big factor is, can the they think inflation is going to come back to target? we did from 2003 to 2007.  That's what we're doing again now.  Of course, there are about how good that argument really is, and that does affect policy.  But I if we're going to talk about symmetry, it should be symmetry in the sense of So, given the way that or another, even if they're persistent, isn't Committee make a reasonable case that That's what all kinds of debates feel strongly that 'We'd be worried if we couldn't make a good case that inflation's going to come back to target from wherever it is.'

December 15-16, 2015

main concerns about our current decision today.  One is, we're normalizing so slowly that it's really almost no normalization at all.  I think you have to take that account.  We could easily get hit with weaker data.  We've had a lot of residual seasonality I was talking to President Harker about this yesterday.  You half of next year, and you really don't get going very far on I have three but possibly into in the first quarter, for instance. could easily get weak data in the first a normalization process.

idea that we may not ever be able to get truly off the We may not be able to return to the of our most of our theory is based, and most of our intuition is based.  We may that. I think we have to face up to the effective lower bound in a meaningful way, and that we might have to operate in an environment of low nominal interest rates for a very long time. equilibrium of the period from 1984 to 2007, which is the equilibrium on which most empirical work is based, not be able to get back there, and we have to think about how we would conduct monetary policy in an era that's like not particularly close to normalizing.  Even in this yearning to go back to the 1984-2007 era, and you have to hope we can, but we may not.  And the gradual me think that we may not to get there. Another aspect of this is, yes, we're trying to normalize, barely-25 basis points here today.  But the G-7 isn't normalizing, and they're my head, I think we've still got recognize that we may not be able to get there.  I pace, in combination with what the data might possibly hand us, makes be able

be insufficiently state contingent in the included 17 straight meetings by this an increase in the policy rate of 25 basis points at meeting.  That does not look very state contingent.  In retrospect, I'm fairly certain The second concern is the possibility that we will normalization process.  The 2004-06 normalization cycle Committee-a few of you were here-that had every single

December 15-16, 2015

it was not optimal policy during that era.  In addition, it ended very badly for the U.S. economy and for the global economy.  Governor Tarullo used the phrase 'maintaining optionality,' which, historically, has been very popular around here, and it's popular with me.  I think you definitely want to maintain optionality.  The Committee desperately needs to be more flexible, sometimes speeding up and sometimes slowing down in response to macroeconomic events.

we can actually get to a situation in which we're willing to make Lacker that we could try to phrase something something like that. the 'data dependent' phrase so much that it may be losing effectiveness anyway sure if that really means trends in the data or the latest reading on a particular just days before a particular meeting.  So I think we still have work to do on into a 'measured pace' sort of scenario.  That I'm not quite sure how one decision at one meeting and a different decision at the next meeting.  But we cannot let 'gradual' become the new 'measured pace,' with the Committee just marching on regardless of what the data are saying.  I agree with President like 'data dependent gradualism' or 'gradual but also data dependent' or We've used because no one is element of the data this dimension.  There's a lot of risk that we get did not work out well from 2004 to 2006.

I don't think we have enough the unconditional probability of a recession in any year is probably 15 percent.  So it could by bad data and go back into recession sometime over the forecast prudent policy would be to allow some runoff in the balance sheet to reduce it and at more headroom in the don't think that ending reinvestment would have much of an My third concern, and my last comment here, is that headroom on the balance sheet.  The Committee remains unwittingly committed to QE as the main policy tool should a recession develop over the policy horizon, and the staff reminded us that easily be that we get hit horizon.  A least move it a little bit toward a more manageable size, in order to give us circumstance of a new recession.  I

So I that the Bank of Japan has? Now, I know that the Committee, across the 'hawk/dove' spectrum here, has basically sworn off QE.  But I policy rate.  Until we get there, we're probably dependent on QE.  Once the crisis hits, there's going to be think we want to ask ourselves, are you willing to go to $6 trillion, $7 trillion, or the kind of balance sheet

into that scenario.  I don't want to get in that scenario, and you don't, either.  But reality of our situation while the policy rate remains very low.  So I urge the sheet by ending the I really think it would just be prudent to allow some runoff.  I don't think it would have much impact on the economy today, but it would be a way to create a little more headroom in case we got that's the Committee to give some thought to creating headroom on the balance reinvestment.

As I mentioned yesterday, I think it's likely to be necessary for the economy to run above trend for some time to ensure that inflation does evolves about as expected, I'm prepared to support a very gradual path for rate increases to achieve that move gradually-again, assuming that the path is about as we expect.  And I would single out the mention of 'gradual' twice, which will certainly be noticed.  Let me that and am right that the market observers will read the SEP and think, 'Four 'Let's focus on March.'  There will tendency to assume that there's another increase in March.  Let me just say now that is not my prior at all.  I have no prior about March.

In October, the Committee stated that it would be appropriate to First, we saw some further improvement in the labor market, and, second, the Committee was reasonably confident that inflation would move back to its 2 percent objective over the term.  In the previous go-round, I noted that

December 15-16, 2015

of future inflation have changed very little.  Alternatives B and C would raise the rate target, but neither offers as complete a rationale for this decision as I would indications federal funds have preferred.

statistical forecasting models, as well as forecasts, suggest that inflation is likely to remain below target over term.  To maintain its credibility, the FOMC must ensure that the public fully how monetary policy decisions relate to the Committee's stated objectives and turn, credibility is crucial for keeping inflation expectations well anchored.  I therefore rationale for raising rates at a that if we delay raising rates, we face the risk of having to eventually tighten rapidly in inflation. As I discussed in the previous go-round, our best market- and survey-based the medium understands plans.  In believe it would be useful to offer a more complete and explicit time when the modal outlook still calls for very tame inflation.  Such an explanation could build on concerns and disruptively in the event of a rapid increase communications.  Thoroughly explaining the in the decision will help build public understanding of the Committee's reaction we maintain the credibility of our 2 percent inflation target. If this concern or other risk factors broadly reflect the Committee members' thinking on why a rate increase is appropriate at this time, then I would encourage the Committee to take every opportunity to explain these concerns in its key factors function and ensure that

The language in the is 'well under may hold off people for a time.  But, as they say, inquiring minds will want to know what mean by that.  On this matter, I think it would be beneficial to clarify in the press conference Another focus of the public will be statement that we anticipate continuing reinvestments until rate normalization way' we

A move of 25 basis monetary policy in a very large way, especially as effective lower bound and we still have a very large balance sheet.  So an interesting tension between those two things. On the one hand, this nearly 10 years.  On the points is not going to affect the stance of we're starting from the it's think, are that the economy turns out to be weaker than we expect, initial move leads to a more dramatic tightening of financial market conditions than we risks of not moving at this meeting are even greater. to the first risk of a forecast error, that's always a risk.  But because I judge such The risks we take, I that this desire or anticipate, or both.  But I think the With regard

But not tightening because conditions could tighten unduly doesn't seem compelling to me, either. risks market conditions financial tightening, I judge the risk of another taper low for two reasons.  First, other than in the high-yield market, which is have not tightened appreciably, even as the probability today from a months ago.  In areas outside the high-yield market, there's been movement, but that doesn't seem inappropriately sized relative to that shift in monetary meeting, equity markets are little changed, the risen modestly. In terms of the risk of financial conditions tantrum as quite undergoing a lot of stress, financial conditions probability of a tightening move this year has moved up to a 90 percent 30 percent probability a few some policy expectations.  Since the October FOMC dollar is slightly firmer, and bond yields have

However, it's Even in high yield, which is under considerable seems fundamentally driven by the persistent weakness in energy prices. interesting to see how the high-yield debt market performs over the next few weeks.  I would say, 'So far, so good,' but this not a reason to delay at this point.

conditionsthe upward path of short-term rates is shallow, and that the balance sheet will stay large for a while longer.  The language 'until normalization of the level of the federal regard.  If we go more slowly in raising short-term Second, I think we've reduced this risk of a sharp tightening in financial those are famous last words by me-by emphasizing that likely to be in alternative B that investment will continue funds rate is well under way' is helpful in this rates, this will likely push back the expected timing of ending reinvestment, and that should

objective of lifting the effective funds into the new target range and also raising other money market rates, I fully expect that our overnight RRP facility can put a relatively firm money market rates.  The fact that we'll be operating the overnight RRP without an portfolio of Treasury securities, will also run out of headroom here.  I also think it will help by monetary policy control.  That's our first and foremost priority In terms of the risks post-liftoff in achieving our rate tools will work.  Our testing has shown that the floor under explicit cap initially, limited only by the size of our help by reassuring people that we will not underscoring our commitment to here.  Having both a belt, which is the IOER, and suspenders, the overnight RRP, is a very good thing.

In other words, if people it, then we probably shouldn't be too upset about it, either. I also think that it's important not to overreact to any actually occur over the next few days or weeks, especially particular circumstances of year-end.  Year-end will generate its own set of unique pressures related to bank balance prove short lived.  That said, should the effective range, then I would favor adjusting the parameters of our tools.  Obviously, how we would respond would depend on our judgment of others weren't upset about to push and pull.  We could change the level of the the maximum bid amount think any of this is going to be But we do have a number of levers IOER, the level of the overnight RRP rate, or both.  We could raise limit to do term RP or use our Term Deposit Facility.  I don't

and that we have these briefings few days so that we can all be kept fully informed and can respond necessary, but I'm glad that we have these options available, scheduled over the next quickly should that prove necessary.

I want to commend the Chair for all you've done to prepare markets and bring Finally, this Committee along in a united fashion.  Well done.

YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  Okay.  Well, we're close here.  I heard B as written, although President Harker did make one I see some overwhelming support for making that change, CHAIR considerable support for alternative suggestion pertaining to language.  If let me give you an opportunity to express it.

Chair, I thought that phrase was acknowledging the lags in to hear what you thought. MR. BULLARD.  Madam monetary policy, and I'd like

Let me just I think many of the people around this table have joined the regarding discount rates, let me mention that, commonly, when the discount is changed, which occurs usually commensurate with a change in the federal funds rate approved by the FOMC, some, but not all, Federal Reserve Banks have requested requested it.  So the standard practice is that the rate up to the approved new national average in all areas of the country. CHAIR Okay.  Well, we have now taken the mention something.  Because System since the last interest rate cycle and may not be entirely familiar with what I'll call standard procedures rate target that's that change.  This time, we have 10 that have boards of the remaining Reserve Banks, within about a day of the FOMC announcement, request the same change in their primary credit rates-it's called a conforming rate request-to bring the discount

Banks, this requires a vote of the board of directors of the Bank. think this decisionmaking authority is delegated to a committee of the board board of procedures in different Banks, but I did want to note that it increase would return to our Secretary of the Board with a request for a Now, in many Reserve In some others, I rather than the full board, or, in some cases, it can be delegated to the president by the directors.  So there may be different is quite standard-and this should occur very rapidly, within 24 hours-that Reserve Banks that have not requested an conforming change.  And, the Board of Governors has just voted to, essentially, preapprove those requests.

implementation note that was just distributed will be published today Committee's policy statement, and it includes the domestic policy You know that the as an addendum to the directive verbatim.  Then what we've agreed is that if, during the intermeeting period, we need to

Our plan is to record and prepared and published with the meeting.  Let me say that the difference between a briefing and a welcome to quiz staff members and ask them questions, but Let me say about these briefings or make intermeeting adjustments, all of these briefings can be converted, even midstream, into FOMC meetings, FOMC prepare transcripts of all of these briefings/meetings, even if they're briefings and don't turn into meetings.  If they do turn into meetings, then minutes will be minutes of the January FOMC meeting is that, in a briefing, you're

I'm sorry to return to this point, but, in the 'Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation,' the word 'unanimously' appears Since the consequence whatever need the word 'unanimously.'

YELLEN.  No, we do because these are Board votes, and we're reporting Board was.  So we're formally recording CHAIR votes.  If they're not unanimous, anyone who dissented would be listed explicitly as a dissenter, potentially with some short statement as to what the dissent here, in the implementation note, votes of the Board of Governors.

Chair, in the past, when we've had briefings, have we then distributed the transcripts? MR. BULLARD.  Madam prepared transcripts and

YELLEN.  No, we haven't.  But, in light of the fact that any of these briefings aftermath of this decision, CHAIR could turn into meetings and there would seem to be some historical value for the public in understanding what happened and what our discussions were in the

record.  We turn into meetings. we thought it wise to actually make transcripts of the briefings to have that historical will need it, of course, if any of them released after five years with MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  So the plan is that they will be everything else?
