MR. FISHER.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  will e  referring  he b tot package  of harts  hat  hould e  in ront  f  you.' It as  a  Class   cover nd c t s b f o h I a begins ith  a  color  hart howing  3-month  deposit  ates.  oday I  will  e w c s r T b going  over our istinct  bjects.  o give  you a  roadmap: First, ill f d su T I  w discuss  arket  developments n  general,  ocusing  articularly  some of he m i f p on t causes f  events n  Hong Kong. Second,   will iscuss  ecent  pen  market o i I d r o operations.  hird,    would  like  o ake   few  minutes o ring he ommittee T I t t a t b t C up-to-date  the erformance  of rimary  dealers.    think  t  s mportant  or on p p I i i i f me to  give  you  a  sense f hat  I  have  been  doing ith  the ealer  ommunity. o w w d c After hat,   ill e  seeking wo  votes. ne is he  normal  vote o  ratify e t Iw b t O t t th open  market  operations nce  he  September  meeting.   also ill e  asking i t I w b for n  increase  n he ntermeeting eway.  After hat,  will ome back  and a i t i le t I c comment on  the  swap line  enewals,  hich  are  a  separate  genda  item.  ill r w a Iw seek  a  vote o enew  the wap agreements or nother  ear. t r s f a y

Focusing  on  market evelopments,  he  first ge  of harts  hows d t pa c s 3-month  deposit  ates, cluding  he urrent  ate,  -month  forward,  -month r in t c r 3 6 forward,  nd  9-month  forward or he nited  States, rmany, and  Japan. In a f t U Ge the  first nel,  ou  can  see  that  nterest  te  xpectations gan  to ack  up  here pa y i ra e be b in  the nited  States  ollowing  he hairman's estimony  efore he udget U f t C t b t B Committee  on  October  8. The  next ay, he undesbank  hiked heir  epo ate d t B t r r by  30  basis  oints,   you  can  see  in he iddle anel. o many people n p as t m p T i financial rkets  around  the orld, his  ndicated,  rhaps  inaccurately, ma w t i pe a concerted  ffort  y  the ndustrial  tions  o aise  nterest  tes  lobally.  any e b i na t r i ra g M

people  talked  ery  seriously out ow the  tide  ad  turned nd  interest  tes v ab h h a ra could e  expected o o higher  n  the ndustrial  rld.  Both  in  Germany and b t g i i wo the  United  States, tes  ontinued  o ack  up  for everal  ays  until  he vents ra c t b s d t e beginning n  October  23,  a  date   will ome back  to n  a  minute.  That  was the o I c i day  when financial  essures  irst erged  most  acutely  n  Hong Kong. You pr f em i can  see  that  nterest  te xpectations  oth  the nited  States  nd  Germany i ra e inb U a came off  ather  harply  eginning hat  hursday, ctober 3,  and  bottomed  out r s b t T O 2 on  the ay  of he  sharpest  .S.  equity  arket  decline  he ollowing  onday, d t U m t f M October  27.  Forward  rate arkets ere  already  tabilizing  some extent, m w s to at least  ere, y  the  time  of he hairman's estimony  efore he oint  conomic h b t C t b t J E Committee  on October 9. 2

I  would like  o ote hat  .S.  interest  te  xpectations,    measured  by t n t U ra e as the  forward ate  greements,  id ot  subsequently ck  up.  They stabilized r a d n ba more or  less  t  levels  lightly ove  the ows  reached efore he hairman's a s ab l b t C October  8  testimony, ereas  German interest  te  xpectations,  flecting wh ra e re a rise  hat  ccurred n arket  rates, e  still  ite    bit  igher.    think  his  oes t o i m ar qu a h I t g a  long ay toward  explaining  he elative vements in  the ollar  nd  the w t r mo d a mark.  One does  not  need  to ook  anywhere  else ven  though any financial l e m market  analysts  re ooking nder  every ock  and  in  every ook  and  cranny. a l u r n You can  see  in he  bottom  panel hat  apanese nterest  tes,   measured  by t t J i ra as forward ate greements,  re  still ite  lat.    will  ome back  in  a  moment  to r a a qu f I c some events eading p  to  this  orning's  evelopments n  Tokyo. l u m d i

Turning  to he harts  n  page  2,  I  will ocus n  the ausation  f he t c o f o c o t events n  Hong Kong,  or  as  the hairman  sometimes  puts t,    discussion i C i a of who sneezed  last.  his iscussion  ot  necessarily    point    finger  t T d isn to a a anyone  but  to  delineate e eries  f  events  hat  ed p  to he inancial th s o t l u t f pressures.  he  first nel  shows  the ercent  hanges  in  the  foreign  xchange T pa p c e value  of he aiwan dollar, e  South  Korean won,  and  the ong Kong dollar t T th H since eptember  30.  The middle  panel hows 1-month  interbank tes  or S s ra f Taiwan,  South  Korea, nd  Hong Kong,  and  the ottom  panel hows  percent a b s changes  in ey  equity  ndices  or hose ountries d  for he nited  States, k i f t c an t U Japan, nd  Brazil. a

Working across he op  panel--the ng Kong government  announced t t Ho in  early  ctober hat  hey ould  hold  another  and uction. his  is   more  or O t t w l a T a less outine  vent or hem, ut  the nnouncement  did  indicate  hey ere r e f t b a t w coming back  to he  market  and  would  be  putting  ome pressure  n  land t s o prices.  hey held he uction  everal  ays  later,    October  15,  and  found  a T t a s d on bogus  bid  for ne  of he argest rcels  f and hat  ere  up  for ale.  The o t l pa o l t w s bid  was made by  a  woman  in  the ame of   major  firm nd  she  certainly d n a a di not  have  the illions  ollars  ecessary  o urchase he eal state.  he b ofd n t p t r e T

Hong Kong authorities  e  reviewing heir  ractices r ccepting  ids,  ut  it ar t p fo a b b was rather  hocking o  think hat  n  auction  or his  ind  of eal state  ould s t t a f t k r e c involve omeone who was a  mental  patient,  ite iterally. s qu l

Several ays  later,  iwan ceased ntervening   the xchange  market d Ta i in e and  allowed ts  urrency o epreciate  ignificantly. s  posed  a  question  n i c t d s Thi i the  minds  of any foreign  xchange  market  participants  e orld  over--a m e th w profound  question.  f    country  ith  such  a  high evel  f oreign  xchange I a w l o f e reserves  as not  prepared  o  defend ts  urrency,  ho would? The  Taiwan w t i c w government  certainly  d  the apacity  o  defend heir  xchange  rate,  ut  it ha c t t e b turned ut  they  did ot  have  the ill. he question  n  everyone's  ind after o n w T i m Taiwan's ecision  as whether he eople's  epublic f hina, nd  not  so d w t P R o C a much Hong Kong,  would need  to  devalue. or  many people he  answer  to F t that  uestion  ppeared o  come when,  on  October  23 or  late  n he vening f q a t i t e o October  22,  the eople's  ank of hina  announced  a  reduction  n nterest P B C i i rates.  hey reduced heir  ending ate  y 150  basis  oints  nd  their  avings T t l r b p a s rate y  a  little  re than  100  basis  oints.  his  appeared o nswer  the b mo p T t a question  or any people y  showing  that  hina  was  worried bout heir f m b C a t competitiveness. e markets  very  quickly  ried  o rice hat  n, ut  they Th t t p t i b could  not rice  t nto he uan.  The only lace t an  be  priced  s n   proxy p i i t y p i c i i a for he  yuan,  the ong Kong dollar.  o,  the ressures  egan  to  build nd  you t H S p b a can  see  in he iddle  column that  he ong Kong monetary  authorities t m t H squeezed heir  oney market  rather  ightly. on't  hink hey xpected t m t I  d t t e overnight  nterest  tes  o  go  to 00  percent. hey expected he ise  o e i ra t 3 T t r t b considerably ss han hat,  ut  there ere  a  number  of layers  ho held  onto le t t b w p w long  positions ping  to  make money in  subsequent  ays. In  the ottom ho d b panel,  ou can  see hem  play hrough o  the quity arkets,  ith  whose y t t t e m w performance ou are  familiar. y

Turning  to he  third  age  of harts,  want  to raw your  attention    the t p c I d to impact f  these evelopments n  credit  arkets. hile  equity  arkets ad o d i m W m h some sharp  losses, e  real  ear nd  adjustment  hat  ook lace n  financial th f a t t p i markets  seemed to e, s  I  heard t,   the redit  arkets. n  the irst nel, b a i in c m I f pa you  can  see  that  bsolute  preads f sian  Yankee and  stripped ady  Bonds a s o A Br over  U.S.  Treasuries cked  up  rather  onsiderably. ese  are easured  in ba c Th m hundreds  of asis  oints. he backup  was more or  less  riggered   the b p T t by pressures  n  October  23 and  thereafter, iously  ith  many contributing o obv w events. n  the iddle anel,  n  order  o  get he  scaling  ight, imply ave I m p i t t r I  s h the  basis  oint  hanges  in wo  Merrill  ynch corporate  ond  indices, e  for p c t L b on high  yield  nd  one  for nvestment  rade,  ver reasuries  ince eptember  30. a i g o T s S Clearly,  here  as  been  some widening  of preads ver reasuries.  hat is t h s o T W worth  noting s hat  he orporate  ields  ave  not oved at  all;  t s he i t t c y h m i i t Treasuries  hat  ave  moved. As shown in  the ottom  panel,  0-  and  30-year t h b 1

rates  ere  down  20  basis  oints ver his  eriod,  nd  that  as the ull  xtent w p o t p a w f e of  the ackup, he idening  of  the pread f  ou will,  oth  to unk nd b t w s i y b j a investment  rade  paper.  It as  very  hard  to hart  n  the ottom  panel ow g w c i b h odd  the  bond  market  has  felt  ver he ast  ew  days  because here  as  been  a o t l f t h tortuous  ack  and  forth  etween  those ho want  to  trade  n  fundamentals b b w o and  the  flight  uality  hat  eems  to e  taking  lace.   cannot how you last toq t s b p I s Friday's velopments  in  a  chart  ecause he  adjustments  appened  so de b t h quickly. ollowing  the elease  f he mployment data ast  riday,  ond F r o t e l F b market  and  fed  funds utures  acked  up and  then, fter  bout 0 seconds, f b a a 9 came right  ack  down as  the  market eturned  o  its  light-to-credit  ure. b r t f post

The fourth  age  displays  hree  harts  o ake a  very  simple oint. p t c t m p Each  panel  shows  the ercent  hanges  in ne  of he 3  currencies ainst  he p c o t G ag t other wo  G3 currencies.   the  first nel,  ou  can  see  that  he ark  has t In pa y t m appreciated  gainst  oth  the ollar  nd  the en  since eptember  1.  In  the a b d a y S middle  panel,  ou  can  see hat  he en  has  depreciated ainst  oth  the  dollar y t t y ag b and  the  mark.  And in  the ottom  panel,  ou  can  see hat  he ollar  s eing b y t t d i b pulled omewhat in  two directions.  at  is,  t  s onsiderably aker  against s Th i i c we the  mark  but   little  ronger  gainst  he en, he ollar  aving een  stable  or a st a t y t d h b f most  of his  eriod. t p

I  want  to o  back  to  what  I  referred   earlier,  mely, hat   hink g to na t It interest  te  ifferentials  ween  the nited  States  nd  Germany explain ra d bet U a most  of he ovement between  the  dollar  nd  the ark, lthough  arket t m a m a m participants look  eagerly  t he  question  f hether here s   flight t  of do a t o w t i a ou dollars  nto arks  and  whether  the  mark is omething f   safe aven.  I i m s o a h think t  s easonable  o ause  and  note hat  n  terms f inancial ows,  here i i r t p t i o f fl t probably as some movement out  of  dollars,  ven  how many of he ssets w gi t a that  ave  been  under ressure  re  dollar-denominated.  ,  when portfolio h p a So managers  sustained  osses  n  Bradys  and  Asian  Yankees  and  equities at  re l o th a more or  less ollar-linked,  re  as going  to  be  some marginal ovement d the w m out  of he ollar.  hat  is  a  very ifferent  estion  rom  one  about he t d T d qu f t macroeconomic consequences;  his  s  a  financial ows ssue.  hink  ed t i fl i It T Truman will e  coming back  to  the roader acroeconomic  question. b b m

Let  me pause  here o  discuss  ome of he vents f he  last  ew  days  in t s t e o t f Tokyo. The yen  has  weakened overnight;  as below 126  this  orning. itw m The  Japanese overnment  bond  yield  s p  to  1.70  percent fter cking p g i u a ba u 10  basis oints  n ust    few days.  A week ago,  with he nnounced p i j a t a bankruptcy f  Sanyo,  a  very rofound vent appened  in  Japanese inancial o p e h f history:  he  authorities  t   major  firm o  bankrupt. t s omething  our T le a g I i s colleagues  t he ank of  Japan  have  been  working  on  earnestly r 0 years a t B fo 1 and  are  very roud  of. bviously,  he iming as another atter.  t ook he p O t t w m I t t

markets  a  few days  to egin o rice t  n.  But  the umber of inancial b t p i i n f market  participants  ound  the orld  who have  been  trading  ith  Japanese ar w w counterparties    the ssumption hat he overnment  stood ehind  them  is on a t t g b very  large. y Friday f ast  eek,  some Japanese ames,  the  weaker  ones, B o l w n were finding  t ard  to  get uoted n he  forward nterest  te arket  in  New i h q i t i ra m York.  Today,  people  are alking out  Japanese nstitutions  ding o t ab i nee t liquidate vernment  bonds.  The Nikkei  was  off  34 points  arlier d  is go 4 e an now down again. e  see  a  grinding  ut  of ome of he  worst ears ne  might W o s t f o have  about he  Japanese inancial ctor.  hat  is eginning o  show up  in t f se T b t forward  rate  arkets. or  example, n  the uro  deposit  arket  as  of he nd m F i E m t e of  October,  here as  no credit emium in  the  3-month  rate  or apanese t w pr f J institutions.  s  morning, t  s  already  50  basis oints  s  compared  to ero Thi i i 2 p a z at he  end  of ctober. t O

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. 250  basis oints? p

MR. FISHER.  Excuse  me I  should ave  said 5  basis oints.    am very  sorry. 'm h 2 p I I trying  o atch p  with  everything  hat  appened  overnight. t c u t h

On that  ote,  et  e turn o  domestic pen  market perations d  try o n l m t o o an t get  my numbers right.  n the ifth ge, here  re  two  panels llustrating O f pa t a i developments n  the  federal  unds arket.  The top  panel hows  the  behavior i f m s of  the ederal  unds  rate. he  blue ines  ndicate e aily  ange f ctual f f T l i th d r o a trading,  he ed  vertical nes  epict  ne  standard  eviation  f unds ate t r li d o d o f r trading  n either  ide f he ffective  te,  he orizontal d  line  s he aily o s o t e ra t h re i t d effective te,  nd  the reen  dotted  ine  s he ommittee's  arget.  n he ra a g l i t C t I t upper  right  f he ub  panels or ach  of he hree  ull  aintenance eriods, o t s f e t t f m p you  can  see  the eriod verage ffective te.  n  the ower anel f he  chart, p a e ra I l p o t the  blue ars how the  daily  evel  f ree  eserves, d  the umbers  on  top f b s l o f r an n o each  of he ars  indicate r  daily  rojection sses. here  is ne  exception t b ou p mi T o related  o  a  labeling  roblem hat   ill ome back  to n   moment. t p t Iw c i a

The intermeeting terval folded ore or  less  s  we had  expected. n in un m a I the  first weekly eriod,  eptember  30,  the ast  ay  of he uarter, s a bi p S l d t q wa difficult  y  in he  market.  The  market  priced  p  for hat  tatement  ate, da t u t s d initially ducing   high  rate, d  we came in  a  little  ter  n he ay  and pro a an la i t d added  quite    few  reserves. hat  resulted   a  very ide  standard  eviation a T in w d in  the ederal  unds ate n  September  30. On the ast  ay  of he iddle f f r o l d t m period,  he  settlement y, he ery  tall  lue ar,  s abeled  .9; hat  umber t da t v b b i l 9 t n does  not  indicate e  size f ur  miss; t  efers  o he evel f he ar,  hich th o o i r t t l o t b w was cut  off  t he op  of he hart.  ur miss  that  ay  was  only  0.3.  This  was a t t t c O d a  day  when we supplied  uite    few  reserves  o he arket, ut iven  the q a t t m b g

skewing  up  in  the ate,  e underestimated    bit  he emand for xcess uring r w a t d e d this  eriod. ctually,  he  point    want  to  make,  which  we describe  n ur p A t I i o written  eport,  hat  he  demand for xcess eserves  as  been  growing.  We r ist t e r h target  emand for xcess eserves  f 1 billion   each  reserve  aintenance d e r o $ in m period  n a  period  verage asis,  ut  actual  emand has  been  creeping  p  on o a b b d u us.  Independent  f he  turmoil  f he ast  ew  weeks,  the ising  emand for o t o t l f r d excess eserves  s n  all ikelihood  function  f eclining erating  alances. r i i l a o d op b Bankers  appear o  be  looking or   little  re excess eserves, t  this  s t f a mo r bu i something  that  e are till  oking nto. w s lo i

In  the  final  eriod,  ou  can  see  hat  e did ave  to  deal   little  th he p y t w h a wi t effects  f he  large  olume  of rading  n  equities. e  largest lume day o t v t i Th vo was on  October  28,  and  with  a  3-day  settlement,  e ettlement  hat  rading th s oft t fell  n  October 1. That  was a  month-end, lready    slightly  mplicated o 3 a a co day  for s.  We  more or  less  ad  a  day  that  ooked ike    maintenance eriod u h l l a p settlement y  where  we had  to  add  a  sizable  mount of eserves d  the da a r an funds  market  had  a  quite ide  standard  eviation. w d

Stepping ack,   would  like o sk  the  Committee  for n  increase  n b I t a a i intermeeting eway  to  purchase ecurities   an  outright sis uring he le s on ba d t intermeeting riod etween  now and  the ecember meeting.  The temporary pe b D increase  ould  be  from  $8 billion  12  billion.  began  another equence w to$ We s of utright  oupon  purchases ast  eek. We  have  a  significant unt  to o c l w amo execute oing  forward.  We  estimate  hat  ur  holdings  ill eed  to  grow g t o w n about  $15 billion   the aintenance eriod  nding  around  the  time f he by m p e o t Committee's ext  meeting  and  that  he umulative eed  will ncrease  o p  to n t c n i t u $20  billion   the eriod mmediately  ollowing  he ecember meeting.  I in p i f t D would  like  o omplete he  portion  e are  planning  o  do  on  an  outright sis t c t w t ba in  the arket  before e get hat ate  n  the ear.  So,  by  the ime f he m w t l i y t o t December meeting,    expect o  want  to  add  around  $10 or $11  billion I t through utright erations,  incipally    coupon  securities.  wever, o op pr in Ho given  that  he reasury ssuance  f ills  eems  to  be  increasing mewhat,  I t T i o b s so also ope  to uy  some bills  little  ter is  onth or  early  n ecember. h b a la th m i D

Before  turning  o our  questions  nd  your  vote,    would  like  o alk  o t y a I t t t you  for   few  minutes bout he  performance f he  primary ealers, a a t o t d as shown on  your  next age.  I  will  ry o  go  through ome of he ackground n p t t s t b o our  primary ealer  elations. d r

Bluntly  ut,  e have  not  succeeded n  removing  the Good p w i " Housekeeping"  seal f  approval. here  are  many customers n  the arket o T i m who insist at  hey ill nly  deal ith rimary  dealers.  here  are th t w o w p T municipalities  d  other ublic  odies n his  ountry hat  ave  such  a an p b i t c t h requirement  n  their  nabling  egislation,    many other  ustomers ollow i e l and c f that  ractice formally.  o,  we have  not een  successful ere. t  the ame p in S b th A s time, t as  been  hard o  motivate  ealers  o erform.   frankly  ace i h t d t p I f something  of   moral  hazard ecause here  s o  longer   volume a b t i n a requirement.  reviously, at  as an  easy  thing or he ealers  o  measure.

What I  had  hoped  to o is rovide he ealers  ith  report  ards hat d p t d w c t they  could ake ome and  share ith  their  anagement and  really derstand t h w m un how we saw them. I  then  decided hat    did ot ant  to ead  about hose n t I n w r t i the  Wall  Street urnal. o,  we came up  with  a  formula or haring  heir Jo S f s t relative rformance ith  them,  at east  n  the irst ur riteria, hout pe w l o f fo c wit giving hem  something hey ould  take ome. The following  our harts  ive t t c h f c g you  some sense f he erformance f  the ndividual aler  irms,  hough o t p o i de f t they  will ot nable ou  to  master he  details. n e y t

The first nel  shows  primary ealer  erformance n  financing  esk pa d p i D transactions.  e  horizontal is hows  the ercent  f ur  volume in  repo Th ax s p o o operations  hat  ny  one  dealer  ctually es  with s, hat  s,  t  easures  the t a a do u t i i m propositions   accept.  he vertical is easures  pricing  ompetitiveness we T ax m c in  which  zero  represents e  stop-out  ate  n  our perations,  at  s,  he th r o o th i t lowest ate t  which  we operate. lus asis  oints  ndicate tter  ields  e r a P b p i be y w earn  and  minus  basis  oints  easure  poorer ields.  he vertical is eflects p m y T ax r all  ropositions,  t ust  he  ones  we take. n average,  e do  not ake ost p no j t O w t m propositions. r  example,  we may accept nly  $2  billion en we get  $10 Fo o wh billion   propositions.  ,  on  average ost  prices  ill all  elow  the of So m w f b stop-out.  s a  first proximation, or  performance s eflected    the  lower A ap po i r in left  orner;  trong  erformance ppears n  the pper  right  orner. owever, c s p a i u c H there  s nother wist. f   dealer  irm s oo  much of n  outlier d  too ager i a t I a f i t a an e to  price  hrough he  stop-out  ate,  hat  ay say  something bout  its  bility t t r t m a a to finance lsewhere nd  whether  there  ay be  something f   credit  isk e a m o a r associated  ith  its  ame.

So,  that  s nother lement f nterpretation t i a e o i on this  hart. c

The next  chart  llustrates  mary ealer  erformance n  Desk outright i pri d p i transactions.  e  horizontal is gain hows the ercent f olume  they Th ax a s p o v actually   with  us.

The  third  nd  fourth  harts  how the ealer  erformance n reasury a c s d p i T auctions  or ill  nd  coupon  issues  espectively.  e horizontal is f b a r Th ax measures  awards  in  their  ame as  a  percent  f otal nders  ccepted y  the n o t te a b Treasury,  nd  the ertical is s   measure  of heir  apital at  oth e and a v ax i a t c th b w the  SEC  use.

We  have  shown these harts  o  dealers  n  the  last  ew  weeks, ut  with c t i f b only  their  wn name indicated  nd  38  black ots epicting e  other  ealers. o a d d th d The charts  rovide   rather  owerful ndication   he  absolute  nd  the p a p i oft a relative rformances f  the ndividual alers  rom  where  we sit.    tried  o pe o i de f I t calibrate  message  to  the  dealers.  hen  I  showed  them  this  nformation, my W i I was able o  point  o oth  12-month  data,  hich  are  depicted  n  these harts, t t b w o c and  four-quarter  ta,  uarter  y  quarter, cause rends  ere  quite  mportant da q b be t w i for  some dealers.    told  he ealers  hat  y  goal as to  improve  median I t d t m w performance.  I  wanted  better  erformance n  their  art.    was rather  lunt p o p I b with  eleven ealers  n  saying hat  hey ere  not oing  much to  meet  our d i t t w d current  usiness  eeds.  Of  that  leven,    told our lat  ut  that  hey ere  not b n e I f f o t w meeting  our  business  eeds  currently.  owever,  I  proposed hat  e work n H t w together  ver he oming six onths to  enable hem  to  describe  o e their o t c m t t m intended usiness  trategy  or eeting  my business  eeds  and  to  make an b s f m n effort  o o so.  I  will  eet  with hem  again wo  quarters  rom  now to eview t d m t t f r fourth-quarter   first-quarter  a.   warned  them that  f  hey ook  no and dat I i t t initiative  describe  o  me how they ntended  o eet  my business  eeds  and to t i t m n could  show no  performance ver  this  eriod,  would  discuss  t ur  next o p we a o meeting  in he  spring  hether  they ished  to nnounce  the ermination t w w a t of their  ealer  elationship  th s  or  whether hey anted  me to  announce  it. d r wi u t w As I  noted, our f he  dealers  eard  that  essage.  Another  seven  heard f o t h m a message  that  hey ere  near hat  ategory.    think  hey ll  nderstood  t, d t w t c I t a u i an they  all  hought he rocess  as reasonable.  gain, he  pictures  n  these t t p w A t o charts  re  rather  tark, d  the  dealers  id  not ave  much to rgue bout n a s an d h a a i that ense. s

I  wanted  the ommittee  to e  aware  of his  rocess hat    am going C b t p t I through.   think t s easonable  ut, bviously,  am sharing  t ith ou  to I i i r b o I i w y solicit  ur  views  if  ou  have  any.  I  want  to  emphasize he ensitivity yo y t s of these ata.  I  have  assured  he ealers  hat    was  not oing o  share t d t d t I g t i publicly, d  I  informed hem  that    did ot  want  them  to  share t ublicly. an t I n i p I did  not  let  hem  take opies ith hem,  but   did  let  hem  take otes.   did ot t c w t I t n I n want  to  read bout t  n he all  Street  ournal,  nd  I  am sure any of hem a i i t W J a m t did  not  want  to ither. e

Mr.  Chairman,  we have  no foreign  xchange  operations   report  or e to f this  eriod.   need  the ommittee's  atification ur  domestic pen  market p I C r of  o o transactions.  eparately, ould  like  o  seek  a  vote o ncrease  ur S I  w t t i o intermeeting eway  from  $8  billion    $12 billion. ould  be  happy  to le to I  w answer  any  questions  n  my report  s  well  as n  my  memo  about ur  desire o a o o to  publish  he tandard  eviation  f he ederal  unds ate or ach  trading t s d o t f f r f e day.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I  must  say  that  our ndeavor o  inform he rimary y e t t p dealers  f our  likes  r  dislikes  reating  franchise lue or hem  whether ou  like  t r  not. o y o isc a va f t y i o I  think  he resumption hat  hey re  primary ealers  nd  you  are n  fact  aking  that  n  issue t p t t a d a i m a makes it uite mpossible  o  maintain  imultaneously at  here  s  no  franchise lue n  their q i t s th t i va i being  primary ealers. d

MR.  FISHER.  I  completely gree ith ou. It s   dilemma,  and  I  think  e are tuck a w y i a w s with  that  ilemma. I  personally uld  rather  ake   hard  look ith he reasury  n whether he d wo t a w t T o t primary  dealer  ystem  makes sense n  terms f nderwriting  reasury ebt ssuance. he s i o u T d i T Treasury till  els trongly,    it  as  for any years,  hat  he xisting stem s mportant.  o, s fe s as h m t t e sy i i S they  wish  to etain  t.  e  are  going o  conduct ur  operations th  someone,  and  until  e can r i W t o wi w get  to  the oint here  we do  not ublish    list  he irms e deal ith,  hich  is hat  I  would p w p a oft f w w w w be  happiest  ith,  hink e are  in  a  dilemma. It s ery xpensive or s  to aintain elations w It w i v e f u m r with  38  institutions,  of  whom  are eadbeats rom  our  perspective.   could  create some d f We a two-tier  ystem.  I  would  be  happy  to alk  o he ommittee  about  that.  t ould  involve ur s t t t C I w o ignoring    lot f irms hat  rovide o  value o  us  but hat ight  continue  o  sit  n  our ist. a o f t p n t t m t o l Unfortunately, at  oes  not oster  ery  good  performance rom  anybody. That  is he ature  f th d f v f t n o the  dilemma.  We  get oor  performance rom  everybody  or  a  franchise lue,  hich  sets  p  the p f va w u dilemma.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You mentioned  that  he  yuan  was not  an  attackable t currency,  hich  I  have  always  assumed  to e  the ase argely  ecause t  s n  essentially iquid, w b c l b i i a ill controlled,  d  blocked urrency. an you  conceive f ny  scenario  hereby  there ould  be  an an c C o a w c

MR. FISHER.  My  colleagues  nd  I  have  thought bout hat,  nd  we have  not ome up a a t a c with  a  way that  ight  be  done  directly.  think  here  re  assets  hat  ould e  sold-m I t a t c b

MR. TRUMAN. My  guess  is hat  hat  s he ay it ould  happen.  In  fact,    country t t i t w w a can  always  experience  he  problem  of omestic apital ight,  hich  there s   substantial t d c fl ofw i a amount  in  China--on he rder f 10 billion  year. nother  way that  omestic esidents n t o o $ a A d r ca attack  he urrency s hrough lassical,      may call  t  hat, ads nd  lags. here  also re ertain t c i t c if I i t le a T a c foreign  nvestment  trategies  at  ould e  used.  I  do  not hink he uan  can  be  attacked  n  a i s th c b t t y i money market  or  financial rket  sense ut--while  t  s uch more  difficult--pressure ma b i i m can certainly    brought n  yuan  asset  alues,  nd  in  some sense hat  as  been  going  on. be o v a t h

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I  have  been  out  f ontact.  hat happened  in he o c W t financial rkets n  Brazil  nd  Argentina  esterday? ma i a y

MR.  TRUMAN. Not  much happened  in  Brazil  fter  hey nnounced  their  rogram. a t a p Rates  were  down marginally  esterday; ock arkets ere  flat  nd  are  down a  little  day. y st m w a to

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Was it he  same  in  Argentina? t

MR.  TRUMAN.

Yes,  both  cases.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  inehan. M

MS. MINEHAN. Just    question.  f  ll  he rimary ealers  eacted  ell  to our a I a t p d r w y counseling, ter,  hat  would  be  the mpact  on  our  operations?  hat benefit  ould  we see  as  a Pe w i W w result  f hat? o t

MR. FISHER.  We  would get etter  rices.  e  would  earn  more for he  U.S. b p W t taxpayer.  e  would  have  more flexibility ur  operations e ore propositions   received. W in  o th m we I  very uch  hope  to  avoid he  situation  at  e had  in  April hen we had  the  large  iss  in m t th w w m forecasting  easury ax  flows  and  an  insufficient ume of ropositions  rced s  to o  back Tr t vol p fo u g into he arket  to  purchase ore securities.  ant  to  see  a  healthier  lume of ropositions t m m I  w vo p so we can  have  much more flexibility.  t  is  very mportant  o  me.  Frankly,  e can  operate  ore Tha i t w m efficiently rall  f  e get  better  nformation  rom  the ealers  nd  they xecute ur  trades  ore ove i w i f d a e o m expeditiously.  r costs hould n  some sense e  covered y  the alue e produce  as  a  trading Ou s i b b v w operation.

MS. MINEHAN. Looking  at our  first art  n  primary ealer  erformance n esk y ch o d p i D financing  ransactions, t  otted  ine  or he  median  is 1.8  basis  oints.  our desire  s o  move t tha d l f t -p Y i t that  p  to  the top-out te? u s ra

MR. FISHER.  No. In  this  ase,  hat  I  would  like  o  see  is ovement of he edian c w t m t m volume  line  o  the ight  nd  a cluster  ealer  erformance round  the ntersection   he wo t r a ofd p a i oft t medians.  Where the uction alls s-a-vis  e  stop-out  ate  s eally    matter f ow much we a f vi th r i r a o h are  doing  because e want  more propositions  an e can  use.  Forgive e for y analogy,  ut  I w th w m m b would  like  o  see  what  Pete ozelle lways  said e  wanted  for he FL, that  n  any  given t R a h t N o Sunday,  any  football am  could eat ny  other ootball am.  I  would  like his  oney market te b a f te t m operation  o  be  very ompetitive.  e  should ave  every ealer  idding  t   reasonable  rice, t c W h d b a a p and  that  ould  give s  the  greatest exibility.    if  e succeeded,  e might  move the edian w u fl So, w w m volume  line  o etween  2 and  3 percent  r  maybe all  he ay to   percent,  ith  every ne  of 0 t b o t w 4 w o 3 or  40  dealers  etting    roughly qual hare f olume.  Maybe  it  ould  be  a  2-1/2 r  3 percent g a e s o v w o

share,  nd  the ricing  ould  be  in   tighter uster   that  hart.  hat  is hat  I  would  be  looking a p c a cl on c T w for,  nd  that s hat  I old he ealers. a i w t t d

MS. MINEHAN. So,  you  would like  o  move that  ntersection  th p and  out? t i bo u MR. FISHER.  Out  more than  up  is hat  I  would  expect. w

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Rivlin.

MS. RIVLIN.  This  question  eflects   lack f nderstanding,  t  are  you creating r my o u bu any  legal  roblems or s  here? If    team  is ropped  from  the eague,  an  they ue  the p f u a d l c s commissioner?

MR. FISHER.  I  referred rlier   the  paper hat  e put  out  in  February  1992  to ea to t w establish e  current  round  rules.  hat  paper ndicated at  he  arrangements  etween  us  and th g T i th t b the ealers  ere  business  elationships   that  e could erminate  n  individual rangement f d w r and w t a ar i no  business  elationship  isted.  here  are   lot f awyers n  the ountry,  nd  anyone  who can r ex T a o l i c a find   lawyer an  sue.  But  I  think  hat  he ealers  re  on  notice.  on't  ant  to ay  that ny  of a c t t d a Id w s a the  dealers  ere  happy  with  the essage  I  was giving  hem, ut  as  businessmen hey nderstood w m t b t u it  ecause   was able o ocument it  n  black nd  white.  That  is hat  I  have  been  trying  o  do.  I b I t d i a w t felt  here  as no  way I  could ome down hard  on  them  unless   could how them  something t w c I s concrete.  s businessmen,    think  hey nderstood  hat.    have  been  taking his  egree f are o A I t u t I t d o c t minimize  the  risk  ou  are eferring . y r to

MS. RIVLIN.  You are  a  businessman,  ut  they hink f ou as  the  government. b t o y

MR.  FISHER.  I  have  been  working  very  hard or   couple f  years n very eeting  I f a o i e m have  had  with he rimary ealers  o  remind  them  that  urs  is   business  elationship  d  that  e t p d t o a r an w want  them  to  treat   as  a  valued ustomer.   gave  a  speech  about his  usiness  elationship us c I t b r to

the  Bond Market  Association  n  Phoenix  in  which  I  emphasized  that  hey hould reat  s  as  a i t s t u valued ustomer,  ot  as  a  mere  regulator. c n

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Did  they niff   that? s at MR. FISHER.  A little,   it  s  a  language hey nderstand. but i t u

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. I  think  hat,  s  a  practical  tter,  he ealers t a ma t d who decided hey  did  not  want  to ehave  according  o  Peter's sires  ould  probably ecide t b t de w d they  did  not ant  to e  primary ealers.  hey would  be  very  unlikely   bring ttention w b d T to a to themselves  y  suing s.  That  would  be  saying,  I ave  been  deemed unacceptable,  d  I  want b u " h an the  whole  world  to now about t." k i

MR.  BROADDUS. Peter,  n  the omestic ond  markets,  he  yield  pread etween  the o d b t s b regular  0-year reasury ote  and  the  inflation-indexed  d  has  diminished    little  er he 1 T n bon a ov t intermeeting riod. t  first ance,  hat  ight  normally e  expected o mply  a  drop  in pe A gl t m b t i longer-term  nflation  pectations. t  I  am wondering  whether  in he  flight   quality,  re i ex Bu t o mo funds  have  been  directed  he  regular  ominal  note han o he  inflation-indexed  d.  Would tot n t t t bon that  e  part f hat  is oing  on? b o w g

MR.  FISHER.  Yes,  I  think hat  s ight.    do  not  want  to ut oo  fine   point  n  it, t t i r I p t a o bu I  think  ost  people n he arket  understand  hat.    don't  hink  eople ave  been  making  too m i t m t I t p h much of  the  shift  n hat  pread.   agree ith  you. i t s I w

MR.  KOHN. It s  true  hat  he ndexed ond  went  down several  asis  oints, i t t i b b p particularly  the  day  of he  sharp arket  break.  So,  I hink here  as a  flight   both f he on t m t t w to o t securities.    ad  been  our  interpretation ell,  t east  or   while,  hat  f  nvestors re  going It h as  w a l f a t i i we

to  get nto omething iquid, ey  would  choose  nominal  bonds. But  as  markets ettled er  the i s l th s ov next  few days--and  hey re  still ittish  d  volatilities  still it igher han  earlier--it  uck t a sk an are a  b h t str me that ome of  that  ffect  ould  have  played ut.  The fact  hat  his pread ay be  down  10 s e w o t t s m basis oints  n  net--and    may be  reading his    little  o inely--suggests, ything, at p o I t a to f if n a th inflation  pectations ve  come down. There  is very eason o  think hat  hey ight  have.  All ex ha e r t t t m the  external  vents ere  playing  n  that  irection,  d  certainly  e one f he iscussions   the e w i d an th t o t d in press nd  in  the arket  was  that vents ere  having   disinflationary  ven  deflationary  fect a m e w a or  e ef on  the .S.  economy.

MR. MELZER. Thanks,  Alan.

Messrs. rell  nd  Truman. P a

MR.  PRELL.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. I  want  to  offer  ust    few j a comments before ielding  o  Ted  for is emarks  on  the ecent  urbulence  n y t h r r t i the  international nomy and  its  mplications  r he .S.  outlook. eco i fo t U

I  think t's  etty  bvious hat  e don't  hare he iew  that  he  United i pr o t w s t v t States  s oing  to e  sucked nto    deflationary  irlpool  y  the ifficulties i g b i a wh b d encountered  broad.

All  major  segments f rivate  pending ook trong ight  ow. o p s l s r n Consumers as  a  group  are  rich nd  happy, nd  it  eems  likely  hey ill a a s t w continue o uy  with  abandon. Manufacturers  f  capital  oods  report  eavy t b o g h inflows f  orders--not  st  or omputers nd  communications quipment, o ju f c a e but  for   wide  range f ther achinery  as  well. ommercial  property a o o m C

prices  re ising  nd  should uttress nresidential  ilding  ctivity. a r a b no bu a Meanwhile,  all ndicators  ousing  demand are  giving ff  ositive gnals. i ofh o p si As for inancing, though he  recent  pheavals ave  produced  some f al t u h widening  of isk  remia  in  the ecurities  rkets,  onditions e  still ch r p s ma c ar su that  ost  projects n  get unding n  what  evidently  re egarded s m ca f o a r a attractive  rms. te

Absent  a  sizable  hock, hen,  he conomy probably ill ontinue  o s t t e w c t power ahead--perhaps  ot  indefinitely,    for ong  enough to  exacerbate n but l inflationary  essures  ignificantly.  our  forecast,  e ecent  evelopments pr s In th r d abroad  are  a  drag n  aggregate  emand,  but ot nough  alone o  bring   halt o d n e t a soon  to  the bove-trend  rowth  we have  been  experiencing.  ne possible a g O source f  restraint    demand would  be  a  steep ecline  n he tock arket. o on d i t s m It's ite ossible  hat  he  large quity  remiums of he ast ill ot e qu p t t e p t p w n b restored; wever, e do  believe  hat  he urrent  rice-earnings  ltiples ho w t t c p mu incorporate realistic  pectations out  future  rofits.   e are  correct, un ex ab p Ifw the  market  surely  ill  eflect   t  some point,  ut hat  ight  not e  soon  and w r ita b t m b the  adjustment  ight  start om  still  gher  evels. m fr hi l

In  our orecast,  erefore,   have  assumed  that  ou  will ut   damper f th we y p a on  the conomic  boom by  raising  he unds ate hree-quarters   point  y e t f r t of  a b the  middle  of ext ear. hat  isn't ot,  ut  we expect hat  he ffects ll n y T a  l b t t e wi be  magnified y  some deflation  he tock arket  bubble.  As you  know, b oft s m we are  predicting  drop  next ear  that  ould  take hare rices  own about a y w s p d 20  percent  rom  Monday's  closing  evel.  e  make no  claim  of recision f l W p in that  orecast--we  e  dealing  ot  simply ith ath  but lso ith  mind f ar n w m a w reading. n  any  event,  e expect hat  nce  people re haken  out f heir I w t o a s o t complacency  about  the conomic  risks, e ond and  loan  markets ill lso e th b w a be  affected--with  urther  idening  of ield  preads nd  some firming  f a  f w y s a o loan  standards.

With  the esultant  nancial straint, and growth  weakens and r fi re dem growth  of utput alls low  potential   our  forecast. t  this oesn't cur o f be in Bu d oc before he  labor  arket  has  tightened rther.  n  that  egard,    few  words t m fu I r a about  Friday's bor arket  data ight  be  in  order. ccording o  that la m m A t report, e nemployment rate as  already  raversed  ome of he istance  o th u h t s t d t our  predicted  yclical w  of .6 ercent.

This  could  spell  ore labor  carcity d  greater  age g m s an w pressure.  e  would  recommend waiting  or nother  eading r wo  before W f a r o t reaching  hat  onclusion, t he  data o  sound  a  cautionary  ote. t c bu t d n

The sharp ncrease  n  average ourly arnings  n ctober  was i i h e i O anticipated    our  forecast. though  the ecent  urge n  wages  is in Al r s i attributable art o  the  effects  f he ike n  the ederal  inimum, we do in  p t o t h i f m believe  hat  here  s n  underlying  endency oward  acceleration  sociated t t i a t t as with  the fforts  usinesses  o  attract  d  retain  orkers n  a  very  tight e ofb t an w i labor arket.  Real  wage gains ave  turned p  noticeably  ver he  past m h u o t couple  of ears,  nd  the  pressure  ill emain  in  that  irection.   think, y a w r d We however,  that  he  decline  n rice  nflation  d  inflation  pectations is t i p i an ex th year  has  created    circumstance  n hich  nominal  wage increases ll e a i w wi b damped in  the  short  un--enough o  offset    pickup n edical  insurance r t a i m costs  hat  eems  to e  in  the ffing. t s b o

MS. MINEHAN. I  want  to o  back  to  Ted's omment about  whether r  not he aper g c o t p we got  on  the worst ase" cenario  as really  worst"  r  "worse."  I  noticed  hat  he aper till " c s w " o t t p s foresees  ome growth  in  1998 for orea, nd  I  must  say  I  am a  little  ncerned hat  he mpact f s K a co t t i o the  Southeast  sian  crisis   Japan  may be  more significant n he aper nticipates.    ou A on tha t p a Ify have  any  comments,  I  would like  o ear hem  because  I'm   little  ncerned hat  ur  idea f t h t a co t o o what  is he ottom  may not eally  e  the ottom. t b r b b

MR. TRUMAN. There  is lways  that  roblem, nd  that  s hy I  made my last a p a i w comment. You could  always  say  that  f  rowth  is oing o e  marked  down by  5 percentage i g g t b points, y not  mark  it own by  6  percentage  oints? hat  is t ne  level.  here  is lways  some wh d p T a o T a chance  of   cumulative rocess,  eminiscent  f   lot f conomic  history.  n the ther  and,  one a p r o a o e O o h also as  to hink bout omething  from  which  many tend o  abstract,  mely,  about hat  might h t a s t na w happen  to  policy  long he ine. here  likely  ome policy  hose feedback ould  prevent  he a t l T iss w c t cumulative  ffects. ,  what  may happen  is ifficult  say.  One point o hink bout, t east  n e So d to t t a a l i terms  of eveloping  conomies, s hat  any of hem  are  high-growth  conomies.  If hey  go  into d e i t m t e t recession, y  their  DP  declines  y  2 or  3  percent,  would  not hink f hat  s  a  big ecession sa G b we t o t a r but  for hem  it  ould  represent  very arge djustment  rom  previous  rowth  rates  f ,  7,  8,  or t w a l a f g o 6 9  percent.  he adjustment  n rowth  would  be  something lose o  double  digits.   might T i g c t We anticipate  at  orean growth  would  still   1  or  2 percent, t hat  ould  be  a  decline  rom  7 or th K be bu t w f 8 percent,    6  percentage  oint  hange  in  the rajectory   he orean  economy.  Obviously, a p c t oft K there  s o  magic  about  zero ere,  nd  I  think  hat  you are aying  s hat  n  some real  ense hese i n h a w s i t i s t economies  will  e  going  into  ome kind  of ecession. b s r

Such  a  development ould  have  further edback ffects,  pecially    Japan hich,  I c fe e es in w would  argue,  s ampered  principally    their  elay n  doing  something bout he roblems  in i h by d i a t p their  inancial stem.  That  has  meant, t east  n  part,  hat  heir  tandard  acroeconomic f sy a l i t t s m measures  may have  been  somewhat less  ffective  an  one  might  otherwise  ave  thought,  nd e th h a they  are o  some extent  unning ut  of tring.    don't  hink  hat  s rue  or ther ndustrial t r o s I t t i t f o i countries   a  group.  The  industrial  rld  seems  to ave  the apacity  o  take olicy  teps  hat as wo h c t p s t

would cushion ome of  these ffects  nd  in urn vert eedback ffects   the eveloping s e a t a f e on d economies.  Things  could  be  much worse.

One part f he  world  that  e have  left  ut  of ur  analysis  astern  urope.  There, o t w o o isE E too, ome economies  have  been  impacted y  at east  he inancial  mensions f ll his  urmoil. s b l t f di o a t t Although  our  trade ith  Eastern  urope  is rivial, tern  European  trade  ith astern  urope w E t Wes w E E is ot  so  trivial.    here  ere  dramatic  hanges  in onditions  astern urope, hat  resumably n Ift w c c inE E t p would have  some impact  on  Western  Europe.  While  it  ay be  fair  o ay  that  estern  European m t s W nations  ave  scope  to se  policy o ffset  he eneral  acroeconomic  effects  f uch  a h u t o t g m o s development,  t  s ot nreasonable  o  question  hether hey ould  be  able o  coordinate  heir i i n u t w t w t t policies   do  so.  So,   think  here  s ome risk  temming  from  potential  velopments n astern to I t i s s de i E Europe  that  e have  not  taken ccount f rithmetically.  s ne  reason hy we probably w a o a It  o i w should  have  called  ur  analysis   worse"  rather  han  "the orst" ase cenario.  bsolute ero  is o "a t w c s A z difficult    define n his  ontext. to i t c

MR.  TRUMAN. It s ore like  dding  0.2 o  0.5  in  1998 and  0.1  to .2 r .3  in i m a t 0 o 0 1999.  I hink hat  s he  order f agnitude.  There  is lways  a  question  bout  multipliers t t i t o m a a in these xercises. w, in  fact,  hen we run  these hrough,  he x  post ultipliers  nd o e  close e No w t t e m te t b to  1.0.

MS. MINEHAN. Apart  from  that, w does  this  cenario  lay ut n  terms f ho s p o i o unemployment and  downward impact  on  inflationary  essures? pr

MR. TRUMAN. That  goes  to he uestion  f lobal  eflation.  erhaps ike Prell t q o g d P M and  Don Kohn ought  to nswer  this  uestion, t y view  is hat  he  fundamental ehavior  f a q bu m t t b o the .S.  economy has  not hanged  so  much in  the ast  alf  ozen  years hat  e can  no  longer U c l h d t w analyze ffects  f his  ize hrough tandard  ggregate  emand approaches. bviously,  he e o t s t s a d O t developments n  question  ould  raise  ur  unemployment  rate nd  lower  inflation  essures ch i w o a pr mu as  one  might  argue hat  he ollapse  n atin merica  in  the arly 980s  may have  affected  ur t t c i L A e 1 o economy. At  that  ime, ur  economy was  recovering  rom  a  recession, t t  lso as a  recovery t o f bu i a w from  a  recession th,  t east  s  perceived  t he  time,  emarkably uiescent  nflation.  flation wi a l a a t r q i In was then  in   4  to  5  percent  ange,  nd  that  ate  f nflation  y have  reflected me influences a r a r o i ma so from  abroad  in erms  of ownward pressure  n  commodity prices  nd  related velopments. e t d o a de W are  looking t n  effect  n our  macro  economy that  s arginal ather  han arge n  terms f a a o i m r t l i o fundamental ehavior. b

MR. PRELL.  There  is   simple ule f  thumb. One has  to  have  a  full-fledged a r o scenario  hat  ndicates e  circumstances   which, or xample,  this  xtra  ouple f enths  f t i th in f e e c o t o GDP  restraint  ght  be  occurring.  f  e just  ad  a  quarter rcentage  oint  ore deceleration mi I w h pe p m in GDP  growth  for wo  years,  e would end  up  by  Okun's  Law with  about   quarter  ercentage t w a p point igher nemployment  rate  y the nd  of he  second  year.  The difference   inflation h u b e t in outcomes  would  be  very  small. ut  if  e blend n  stories out xchange  rate nd  import rice B w i ab e a p

MR. PRELL.  As I  noted riefly,  e  average ourly arnings  eport  or ctober  did b th h e r f O not  upset s.  We  anticipated  other  arge umber,  and  it as in  line ith ur  expectations. e u an l n w w o Th forecast  f   stable  CI increase  n  1998 reflects  e xpectation at  ages will  e  favorably o a E i th e th w b affected  y  the ery  low  rates  f onsumer  and  overall  rice nflation  at  e've  seen  in he ast b v o c p i th w t p year  and  the  apparent  ffect  f hat  rice  ehavior n  inflation  pectations. at  effect s  been e o t p b o ex Th ha

small  on  the edian  of uch  expectations,  r xample, n  the ichigan  Survey, ut  very  striking m s fo e i M b on  the ean. Seemingly, here  as  been  a  convergence f xpectations  he ower  level. e m t h o e tot l W would  anticipate  is  o  have  a  damping  effect  n  wage increases,  d  in  a  sense e are ot th t o an w n looking or he  ongoing  effect  f he inimum  wage hikes hat  ave  raised  he ate f  wage f t o t m t h t r o increases  n he ast ear.  When  we did  simulations out  a  year nd  a  half  go, he imulation i t p y ab a a t s of  a  minimum  wage increase  nvolved ome follow-through   higher ages  raised  rices  nd i s as w p a price xpectations. t  in  fact  onsumer  prices  ave  decelerated,    we see  that  s  a  favorable e Bu c h so a element  in he  near erm. t t

We  have  built    significant  celeration   ealth  nsurance  osts  nto he CI forecast. a ac ofh i c i t E We  have  reports  f ncreases   insurance  remiums beyond  those f  CALPERS o i in p o and  the ederal f employee  health  rograms.

I  guess y final  omment would  be  that  here eems  to  have  been  some increase m c t s recently  n  the necdotal  eports  f  step-ups  n  wage increases.  s ery  hard o  read his i a r o i Iti v t t information, t  I  would  say  that  here's asis  or ome concern  that  he ncreases y be bu t a  b f s t i ma larger  han hose e have  built  nto he orecast.    have  not  seen  the ctual  umbers, ut ust t t w i t f I a n b j to cite omething  that    have  heard,  he urvey f maller  usinesses   the ational  ederation  f s I t s o s b by N F o Independent usinesses  as  evidently  hown a  noticeable crease  n  the ast  ew  months  in he B h s in i l f t number of irms  reporting at  hey  actually ve  raised  ages  and  a  noticeable crease  n  the f th t ha w in i number of irms  saying hey  plan  to aise  ages. f t r w

MR. MCTEER. I ust  ave  a  few  comments that  'm ot ure ill e  all hat  elpful j h I n s w b t h and  a  question.  n the  balance f ayments  arithmetic d  the orst ase ot  appearing  ll hat O o p an w c n a t bad,   think e should ot  get oo  complacent. t eems that  e are  thinking  f he ransmission I w n t I s w o t t mechanism as  being hrough he  trade  nd  the urrent  ccounts  hen it ay be  that  he sian  flu t t a c a w m t A spreads ore through he  capital  ccount. n the  arithmetic,  ile  the et f he wo  tends o e m t a O wh n o t t t b the  same,  the ross f he apital  ccount as  gotten  uch larger  n  recent  ears han he ross n g o t c a h m i y t t g o the  current  ccount. o,  I  think  he act  hat  e have  small rading  elationships robably  ess a S t f t w t r i p l important  han  it  as before apital came so  notable  nd  so  large elative    trade. e  should t w c be a r to W be  careful  bout hat. a t

My  other omment is n  the  stock arket.  I  thought,  hen we had  the  big tock c o m w s market  decline    couple f eeks  ago, hat  here as a  silver ning  o t.    thought t ould a o w t t w li t i I i w provide t  least  art f hat  Mike Prell  as expecting  or ext ear o  that  e  would  give s a p o w w f n y s h u some relief    his orecast r tock arket  adjustments  n  1998.  But  it  eems as  if  t idn't in f fo s m i s i d make a  dent  at ll. a

MR.  PRELL.  Before  the  drop, he arket  had  moved up  further.  o,  as  of onday, I t m S M think  he verage or he  quarter  as actually gher  han  we had  predicted   the  last t a f t w hi t in Greenbook.  Now, if  he  market  stays  t hese ower  levels,  will ome out retty  uch in ine. t a t l we c p m l

The decline  rom  the ery eak  of he arket  to  the ow  that  e forecast,  ing  by  the ilshire f v p t m l w go W 5000,  is bout  25  percent.  e  have  about   percent  nder ur  belts. a W 5 u o

MR. MCTEER. In  line  ith ike Moskow's question  arlier,  ather he tock w M e I  g t s market  is oing  to  fall  ecause ou  expect igher nterest  tes  nd  lower  profits. elieve  ou g b y h i ra a I  b y have  profits ming down from  a  growth  rate f  11 percent  n  the  third  uarter  o  only  1  percent co o i q t in  the ourth  uarter.  hat  seems  rather  brupt. f q T a

MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman,  labor  arkets  have  remained  quite ight   the welfth m t in T Federal eserve  District    recent  onths,  as  employment growth  has  proceeded t   strong  ut R in m a a b moderating ace.  The  District  employment rate  ell  bout  1/2  percentage  oint  n he irst lf p un f a p i t f ha of  the  year nd  remained  at his  ow  level  hrough eptember.  With  the  notable  xception  f a t l t S e o California,  employment rates  n ost  District  ates  ow are  at  lows  not  seen  in everal un i m st n s decades.  Although  California's mployment rate  s till gh  relative    those n  other  tates, une i s hi to i s it has  been  falling arply  nd  labor arkets n  some of he ajor  metropolitan eas re ery  tight. sh a m i t m ar a v Unemployment rates  ave  fallen  o  new lows  in  San  Diego  and  the an  Francisco  ay area. h t S B

For  the istrict    a  whole,  although  hird-quarter loyment growth  was strong, e D as t emp th rate f  increase  as about  1 ercentage  oint ower han  the ery  rapid ace  in he irst lf  f o w p p l t v p t f ha o 1997. This  includes  alifornia  d  Washington  where  the lowdown follows    pickup n  growth C an s a i earlier   the ear. oderation  in  growth  rates  n he ntermountain ates  f rizona,  evada, in y M i t i st o A N and Utah  appears o  be  related   a  slowing n opulation  rowth.

Anecdotally,  have  a  little  rect  ersonal  xperience  ith t a w I di p e w this.   have  two sons.  The older  ne  graduated  rom  college  ack  in  1992,  and  it  ook im I o f b t h almost  a  year o  get   paying ob. he younger  one  graduated  his  ear,  nd  he  already  as  two t a j T t y a h jobs. hile  he  was on  one  of hem  the ther ay, omeone came up and  offered  im another, W t o d s h better  ob. j

Elsewhere,  nd  somewhat related   what  I ust  aid bout abor  arkets,  here  s a to j s a l m t i evidence f  some precautionary ventory  uilding  n  our  area,  specially  he actory  evel. o in b i e att f l The delays n  rail  eliveries  e ausing ome manufacturers  o tockpile w materials cause i d ar c s t s ra be

Despite  this  vidence f trong  emand and  tight  abor  arkets,  he eports  e are e o s d l m t r w getting  n  final  rices  re  still  nerally xed.

Finally,  ke erry  ordan,  e are  seeing vidence f ooming real  state  onditions li J J w e o b e c in the  District, ecially mmercial  real state.  hat  is specially ue ight  ere  in  the esp co e T e tr r h Washington  metropolitan ea. nd we are  beginning  o  hear omments that evelopers  re ow ar A t c d a n making some of  the ame kinds f istakes  s  were  made back  in  the  1980s.  We  have  a  lot  f s o m a o pickup  trucks  n ur istrict,  o! i o D to

At  the ational  evel,  have  a  lot f ew information  ince ur  September  meeting. n l we o n s o I  think  he eadline  f  3-1/2 ercent rowth  in eal DP  in  the  third  uarter  ndicates early at t h o p g r G q i cl th the  economic  momentum  we have  seen  for   year  is ontinuing.  ndeed,  he rowth  rate  n hat a c I t g i t quarter,   we all now,  would  have  been  even  stronger  ad  it ot een  for   slackening  n as k h n b a i inventory  ccumulation. nd it  ppears hat  he  fourth  uarter  tarting f n  a  strong  ote f a A a t t q iss of o n i the ob  report  nd  the urchasing  anagers' eports  re ny  indication.   had  a  big ncrease  n j a p m r a a We i i employment in  October.  The increase  as  well  above  the verage onthly  increase  or he irst w a m f t f three  uarters  f he  year. q o t

In  short,  s  I  see t, e conomy currently pears o  be  growing  at   rate  ell bove a i th e ap t a w a the  staff's  timate  f otential  nger-term  rowth  of -1/2 ercent,  nd  we are  projecting at es o p lo g 2 p a th such  growth  will ontinue  oughly hrough he  second  quarter  f  next ear. eyond this, e c r t t o y B th demand for  labor  ationally  pears o e  outstripping  e  sustainable pply urrently   a n ap t b th su c by factor  f aybe 2 or  3.  That  is ertainly nsistent  th  what  we hear n  our  District  out he o m c co wi i ab t difficulty   inding  mployable eople.

Against his  ackground  of uite obust  conomic  activity,  e ecent tock arket t b q r e th r s m volatility,   see  it,  s eing idely iewed  in  the arkets s  precluding  ny  Fed  policy as  I i b w v m a a tightening r he  time eing.  And what  I  think  s ore important  s hat  ecause he  Fed  is fo t b i m i t b t expected o  remain  on  the idelines r   while,  ven  very  strong conomic  reports  ike  he t s fo a e e l t third-quarter   report  nd  the ob  report  re  not etting  uch reaction   bond  markets.  They GDP a j a g m in are aving  little  fect  longer-maturity  tes.  his  insensitivity onger-term  ates  o he h ef on ra T of  l r t t gathering  omentum m in  the conomy--and  I  worry  about his--may  revent  hem  from  playing e t p t their  sual ole  s  an  automatic tabilizer  he conomy. In  that  ense,  ne  might  make the u r a s fort e s o case  that  he ecent  arket  volatility   caused   de  facto  asing f onetary olicy. t r m has a e o m p

MR. MOSKOW. Mr.  Chairman,  the conomic  conditions  n  the eventh  District  e e i S ar quite imilar  o hat  I  have  been  reporting  or everal  eetings.

As I  have  noted efore,  abor upply onstraints  em  to  be  trimming  growth  in  our b l s c se region. abor  markets emain  very  tight.  he unemployment rate  n istrict  ates s  been L r T i D st ha below 4  percent  ince ay.

Moreover, ased  on  the  unpublished  esults om  the atest npower  employment b r fr l Ma survey,  abor emand continues  o  be  quite obust.  iring lans re  the trongest r ny  first l d t r H p a s fo a quarter  ince 989,  with  hiring  ntentions  maining niformly  igh  in ll eographic  egions  f s 1 i re u h a g r o the  nation. his  survey s ot  going  to e  made public  ntil  onday, November 24,  so  this T i n b u M information  s onfidential  til  hen.

In  terms  of onsumer  spending rends,  etailers  port  hat ales  mproved  over he c t r re t s i t month of ctober  as  the  weather ot  cooler. eports ere  mixed  concerning  hether  there  as O g R w w h been  any  impact rom  the  recent  tock arket  volatility.   example,   very  large  etailer f s m For a r and one of  the ig  Three  automakers eported  hat  ales  ctually proved  in  the ast  eek of B r t s a im l w October.  Another  of he ig  Three  showed no  noticeable pact.  In  contrast,  e ast  f he ig t B im th l o t B Three  attributed ales  ecline  o  the tock arket.  So,  on  this  uestion, ports  f he ig a  s d t s m q re o t B Three  clearly  re ixed. a m

Competition n  the  auto ndustry  s escribed  s  brutal, d  at east  ne  major i i i d a an l o automaker,  eneral  Motors, ill  e  doing ore discounting   the ear erm.

Turning  to  the ational tlook,  espite    good  deal f inancial  rket  uncertainty, n ou d a o f ma the conomic  situation  s  not  changed  greatly  ince ur  last  eeting.  The  news on  inflation e ha s o m

continues  o  be  good, ut  the ong-awaited  lowing n  aggregate  emand seems  to  be  yet urther t b l s i d f out  on  the orizon. ven factoring   a  larger  rade eficit  e  to he ecent  vents n  Southeast h E in t d du t r e i Asia, ur  forecast es  above-potential  owth  this  uarter  nd  out nto 998. The most  recent o se gr q a i 1 data  suggest  hat  abor  emand continues  o  grow more rapidly  han he  working-age opulation t l d t t t p and  that  he ncrease  n  participation  es  as  at east  emporarily ded.  Thus,  the ightening t i i rat h l t en t in labor arkets  that ccurred arly  his  ear ay be  further tensified.  rhaps he  investment m o e t y m in Pe t boom has  increased  ur  productive  apacity  nough  to  avoid   buildup n  inflationary ssures, o c e a i pre but  still  e esource  tilization  bers suggest hat  he ncrease  n emand may have  exceeded th r u num t t i i d the  growth  in apacity. c

On balance,    feel  hat  he isks  ave  increased  nd  are  still    the pside. here  is I t t r h a on u T one  other ecent  vent elevant  o  our  economy that    want  to  mention.  That  is he efeat--or r e r t I t d I guess  more  accurately e  withdrawal--of  e  fast  rack  rade egislation eral  ays  ago.

MR.  GUYNN. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. Since  the ast  eeting,  he ew data nd l m t n a anecdotal  nformation  rom  our  region eem to onfirm hat  he  Southeast  s ow settled to i f s c t t i n in a pace  of conomic growth  that  s ery  similar  o hat f he ation.  hat  is  occurring  fter  ur e i v t t o t n T a o regional  conomy had  led he  nation  or everal  ears.   suspect  hat  xperience  olors  ur  view e t f s y I t e c o of  the orld, ince e have  watched  our  business  eople ork through ight  abor  arkets or w s w p w t l m f some years ow. n

Retail  ales  n  the egion ave  been  very neven, ut uch of hat  eems attributable s i r h u b m t s to  the hange  in he pening ates f chools nd  some unusual eather. e  talked  o  retailers c t o d o s a w W t about  the pcoming holiday  eason.  They now describe  heir  utlook s  one  of autious u s t o a c optimism, nd  that  s  a  retreat  om  the nguarded  optimism hat  hey ere  expressing  n  late a i fr u t t w i summer. Manufacturing ctivity s  slowed  in  the  District.  t surprisingly,  arel  ontinues a ha No app c to  be  the eakest  segment.  According o  our  survey f anufacturing  n  the outheast, ich  is w t o m i S wh to  be  released  omorrow,  production  n  October as little nged  from  September.  The  backlog t i w cha of  orders as  risen  or wo  consecutive  onths.  On the ther  and, utlook ndices  or h f t m o h o i f shipments,  ew orders,  nd  backlogs ill e  reported  s  having eclined  fter  arge  ncreases n a w b a d a l i in September.

Residential nstruction   the outheast  as  now slowed  somewhat,  but  there  s co in S h i a noticeable ift  n  commercial  construction  om  office  nd  industrial  ructures  ward etail sh i fr a st to r space.

Nationally, ee  a  continuation  he  good  growth  we have  observed n  overall I  s oft i employment and  modest  price  ovements.

On the  inflation  ont,    see  the utlook  or rices,   measured  by  the mplicit P fr I o f p as i GD deflator,  out he ame as  the  Greenbook, ut hat  s ithout ssuming  a  75 basis  oint ncrease ab t s b t i w a p i in  the unds ate nd  without   major  stock arket  correction. ile  I  feel trongly at  e f r a a m Wh s th w should ot  lose he  inflation  ins hat  ave  been  made,  I  am not uite  s  certain   the n t ga t h q a as Greenbook  that  e are  on  an  imminently nflationary h.  I  see  little  rd  evidence o ate hat w i pat ha t d t this  s he ase r  that  mmediate  and  aggressive  olicy  ctions  re ecessarily  eded  to et s i t c o i p a a n ne g u back  on  path. ndeed,  he orecasts  he  broader ndices  f nflation  ow less cceleration  an I t f oft i o i sh a th does  the PI. The CPI,  we have  to  remember,  reflects  e ffects  f he nergy rice  wings  in C th e o t e p s 1996 and  1997,  which  lowered he  CPI earlier ring hat  eriod,  eading  o  greater ojected t du t p l t pr relative  ticks  oing  forward. up g

Of  course,  ny  judgment  on  the robability   eterioration  inflation  pends  on  an a p ofd i de assessment  f  the urrent  tance f olicy.  While  the onetary  aggregates  ave  been  somewhat o c s o p m h expansionary  ver  the ast wo  years,  he  evidence or he ast ouple f onths  is hat  rowth o p t t f t p c o m t g of  the ggregates  as  declined  omewhat. Moreover,  real  nterest  tes,   we interpret  em,  do a h s i ra as th

As has  been  discussed  his  orning, he ild ard n  the conomy at his  ime  is,  n t m t w c i e t t i fact,  he olatility he  financial  rkets  worldwide.  Our own estimate, ne  before e got  the t v in  t ma do w Board  staff's  rk,  also uggests    0.2  to .3  percent  arkdown  of eal  DP  growth.  I emain wo s a 0 m r G r concerned,  s  does  Cathy  Minehan I  believe  ecause he  explored his  isk  o  the xpansion a b s t r t e when she  questioned  ed  Truman about  the econdary pillover  fects,  pecially  om  Japan. T s s ef es fr Less  well ublicized,  en  in  Japan, ntil  he ast  ouple f ays  has  been  the ressure  n  the p ev u t l c o d p o Brazilian  nd  Argentine urrency nd  equity  arkets.  I  believe  he razilian rket  actually s a c a m t B ma ha declined  ore  than he ong Kong market  over  the ast  our r  five eeks. This  point  as m t H l f o w w driven ome to  me last  eek when I  had  a  visit om  Argentina's bassador o  the  United h w fr am t States.  hould  there  e  significant blems  in razil,  he act  hat  ver  30  percent  f S b pro B t f t o o Argentina's ports  re o  Brazil  ould  put  additional  essure  n  the rgentine conomy. I  see ex a t c pr o A e the  risks  ot nly n  how much our  real  DP  growth  may be  marked  down,  but  also n  the n o i G i possibility t  he  United  States  ill ave  to tep n  and  support  he conomies  of ne  or nother ha t w h s i t e o a of  those ountries.  r.

MR.  STERN.

Just    couple f ther omments about  the egion: otel  occupancy  rates  n a o o c r H i Minneapolis re  quite igh.

As far s  the ational  conomy is oncerned,  f    assume that  he reenbook  has  the a n e c i I t G various  epercussions  hat  has  been  happening  in outheast  sia  and  elsewhere bout ight, r ofw S A a r then  it eems  to e that  e face  greater  isks  han  are ndicated  he reenbook  numbers.

The question  n  my mind is urely  hen,  not  whether,  nflation  ll scalate re i s w i wi e mo rapidly.  he fundamentals  ave  not hanged  much since he  Chairman's  ouse testimony  efore T h c t H b the  Committee  on  the udget  on  October  8,  which seemingly as made to  prepare  arkets or B w m f a possible  ightening.  nything,  nsettled rkets side,  iven  a  high  level f emand growth t Ifa u ma a g o d and  accelerating  ges,  the ituation  s  worsened  from  an  inflation  sk  tandpoint. rket wa s ha ri s Ma conditions  ay cause  us  to efer ny  action  oday,  ut  it  eems  to e that  he hallenge  or m d a t b s m t c f monetary  policy  ould e  far reater  oing nto 998 and  beyond  if  conomic  growth  tapers  ff c b g g i 1 e o and  inflation  cks p  as  expected. e  may be  running ut f oom for ontinued  eferral pi u W o o r c d in taking  n appropriately  ti-inflationary cy  tance. a an poli s

Yet, t  s ard  to  quibble  ith c h w s th m i i h w results   far,  nd  inflation   nlikely  o  rise  t he ate  t  id n  1990  and 1991. But  I  wonder, o a isu t a t r i d i had  we been  more  explicit ong ourselves,   ot  the ublic,  bout ur  objectives,  ether e am ifn p a o wh w could  have  locked n  CPI  inflation     percent  r ess  hen the conomy was expanding i at2 o l w e strongly.  n  my opinion,  t ill e  very  difficult  act pportunistically    lock n ower I i w b to o and i l inflation     weaker  economy because f ressures  o ocus onetary  policy  n  the eal  ide, ina o p t f m o r s even  if  nflation  essures ntinue  o  mount.

Looking  ahead  at he ational  conomy,  I  find yself ainly  focused n  what  we t n e m m o know now that  s ifferent  om  what  we knew at  the ast  eeting.  At  that  ime,  he ikelihood i d fr l m t t l of the  emergence  of nflationary  essures  eemed sufficiently at hat    monetary  policy i pr s gre t a tightening emed both  likely  nd  imminent.

As I  look  at he reenbook,   find yself   bit  ore  optimistic an he  Greenbook t G I m a m th t staff  bout he omestic conomy and a  bit  ore pessimistic  out he nternational uation. a t d e m ab t i sit My  optimism  about  the omestic conomy relates stly o roductivity.  e Greenbook d e mo t p Th assumes  that  t  least    substantial  action  he ecent  ood  news on  productivity   emporary a a fr oft r g ist and  that  t  ill evert  o rend uite  orcefully    1998  because f he lowing f rowth  and i w r t t q f in o t s o g because  of ery  tight  abor  arkets.   increasingly  ink  t  s ossible  hat  he onfluence f ight v l m I th i i p t t c o t labor  arkets, igh  investment, d  technological  ange  have  come together  ive  us  at east m h an ch tog l a  sustained  purt  n roductivity  creases. ,  I  am less  ure han he reenbook seems  to  be s i p in So s t t G that  e will eed  to aise  nterest  tes  n he ear erm. w n r i ra i t n t

Incidentally, agine  myself aking a  speech  a  couple f ears rom  now that ould I  im m o y f w talk  bout  what  we did n  the ssumption hat  he reenbook lays t ut  absolutely ght.  t  s a o a t t G i o ri I i a hard  speech  to ake. It ays: e raised  nterest  tes,  tanked he  stock arket, e cut he m s w i ra we t m w t growth  rate  o  less  han alf  hat  we ourselves  hought  he otential  owth  rate  as,  we raised t t h w t t p gr w unemployment,  and  yes  by  then e are dmitting  hat  e overshot  ecause e are  beginning  o w a t w b w t lower  the nterest  te  gain. e  did his  ecause e were  worried bout nflation, ch  even i ra a W t b w a i whi in  the reenbook  forecast s quite odest.  Then we have  to  explain  hat  lthough  e were  on G wa m t a w the  forefront  rguing hat  he PI  was overstated d  should e  corrected,    s eally ofa t t C an b it i r misleading  o  leave hat  orrection  hen we look  at nflation.  ,  I  would  find his    very t t c inw i So t a hard  speech o  make,  but  maybe we will ot ave  to.

On the ther and,  as  I  said,  y pessimism bout he  rest  f he orld  is   little  eater o h m a t o t w a gr than  the reenbook's. his  is ased  on  no  real nowledge, ust    feeling  hat  here  s   great G T b k j a t t i a potential r nowballing  eakness  around  the orld  and  that  ur  immune systems n he  United fo s w w o i t States  ay not  be  quite s  good  as  we thought. e  might  get  that  tock arket  correction  t  by m a W s m no raising  nterest  tes  ut imply y  the ontagion  rom  abroad.

On the  issue f he  overall  olicy  tance,   ave  become persuaded hat,  f  nything, o t p s Ih t i a the  present  ederal  unds ate  s   little    the ow  side.   say  that  or hree  easons. ne is hat f f r i a on l I f t r O t in  the taff recast e  unemployment rate  s ow and  inflation   eating  p.  It s eating  p at s o h i l ish u i h u a very  slow  rate  hat  s ard o bserve,  ut t  s eating  p.  The  direction   lear.    believe t i h t o b i i h u isc I monetary  policy  hould tay head  of he  game in ases ike  his. econdly, his  s he  first s s a t c l t S t i t opportunity at    have  had  to  listen    go-around f he eserve  Bank presidents,  t  I hink th I toa o t R bu t most  of ou  were  supporting  hat  onclusion.  ow, I  know enough  about he  law  of verages o y t c N t a t realize  hat  hat  the ational  tatistics  icate ll e  reflected   balance n  what  Reserve t w n s ind wi b on i Bank presidents y, ut  a  lot f ou  were  providing  necdotal  vidence hat  s ot ecessarily sa b o y a e t i n n apparent  n  the  aggregate  tatistics  his  oint.    think here  re  indications   hat  vidence hat i s at  t p I t a int e t some overheating  ay be  on  the ay.  Thirdly,  want  to efer  o ome calculations  at  he  staff m w I r t s th t has  done  on  the aylor ule.

Having  said hat,  et  e turn o iming.  here  I  find   real  uandary ecause  from  the t l m t t T a q b standpoint   domestic anagement alone,    think  hat  he roper ourse ould  be  to aise  he of m I t t p c w r t funds  rate  romptly y--I on't  now the mount--3/4  ercentage  oint r  whatever nd  that p b d k a p p o a would  be  that.  ut  then he nternational ue  reeps n.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let's  ove forward  with on Kohn. m D

MR. KOHN. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. At  your  last  eeting,  any m m Committee  members were  concerned hat inancial  nditions  ere  too t f co w accommodative  to  prevent  trength   aggregate  emand from  raising s in d resource  tilization m  already  levated  evels, d  hence  imparting--or u fro e l an perhaps ccentuating--an  ward  trend  o  inflation    1998 and  1999. a up t in Indeed,  here as a  sense hat  ightening uld  be  needed  soon, erhaps t t w t t wo p a this  eeting, f  he xpansion n  economic  activity  d  not emonstrate  igns m i t e i di d s of  slowing o  a  more sustainable ce. t pa

In  fact, e nformation  ecoming  available nce he eeting  has th i b si t m shown economic  growth  continuing  o xceed  the rowth  of otential  d t e g p an utilization es  ising.  s a  consequence,    number of arket rat r A a m commentators  have  suggested  hat,   the bsence f inancial rket t in a o f ma turmoil,  he  Committee  would  have  been  highly ikely  o  tighten  his t l t att meeting.  In  my remarks,    will  egin y  examining ome of he  arguments I b b s t behind  this  roposition,  fore urning  o ossible  mplications  r olicy  f p be t t p i fo p o the  turmoil  tself. i

Strong  growth  and  rising  tilization es  ould  weigh  on  the ide f u rat w s o policy irming. ot  only  has  the nemployment rate  allen, d  to  the f N u f an lowest evel  n  several  ecades,  ut  manufacturing  apacity  tilization l i d b c u has risen o ts  ighest  evel  n  2-3/4 ears. oreover,  with  final  emand t i h l i y M d exceptionally  bust,  rospects  re  good  that  he xpansion f utput ill ro p a t e o o w continue o  exceed  the rowth  of otential,  indeed t  oes  for   while n t g p as i d a i the  staff recast.  owever uncertain  he ommittee  might  be  about  the fo H t C NAIRU or  the evel f otential tput,  he  chance  that  nflation  ll l o p ou t i wi increase  oes  up  with  the evel  f esource  tilization.  om this g l o r u Fr perspective,    he  Committee  were concerned bout  the tance  f olicy ift a s o p before,  ther hings  qual  it  ught o e  more so  when the nemployment o t e o t b u rate alls  nd  capacity  tilization es, pecially  nce he ovements in f a u ris es si t m both  variables re  larger  han nticipated.   the  Chairman  has  pointed we t a As out,   track  or conomic  growth  that  ontinues  o  erode  slack  n  available a f e c t i resources  s,  y  definition,   sustainable.  as concern  about  a  similar i b ot Itw set f ircumstances  hat  ed  to  the olicy  ightening  ast  arch,  and  a o c t l p t ofl M forecast  hat  esource  tilization ld  continue  o ise ould  be  the t r u wou t r w strongest  rgument  for   near-term  ightening  olicy,  ven  before arly a a t ofp e e signs f  cost nd  price  ressures  egan  to  emerge. o a p b

But, f ourse,  ther hings  ave  not een  equal,  nd  not  only  in o c o t h b a worldwide  financial rkets. n the  economic  side,  nflation  ntinues  o ma O i co t decline  y  many measures, enerally  alling ort  f xpectations. e b g f sh o e On reason or his  as  been  an  uptick  n  productivity  owth, hich  is olding f t h i gr w h down unit  abor osts.  hese  developments ave  contributed   a  marking l c T h to down of  the  staff recast r uture  nflation,   they rovide ome offset o fo f i and p s in  several  espects  o he  signal  or igher  ates  oming  from  robust r t t f h r c increases   output.  irst,  licy  eed  not e  as  tight  s  it  therwise  ight in F po n b a o m be  because  lower nflation  ans the ommittee  is ot  as  far bove  price i me C n a stability--or  interim  nflation  jective--as reviously  ight  have any i ob itp m thought,  oth ow and  likely  rospectively. b n p

Second,  improved  price  nd  productivity  rformance as  boosted a pe h estimates  f he  growth  of he conomy's  potential d  shaded  down notions o t t e an of  the ange f  unemployment rates  hat  ight  be  associated th  rising r o t m wi inflation.   a  consequence,  t east  n he reenbook,  the urprisingly As a l i t G s strong  xpansion f eal utput nd  the ecline  n  the nemployment rate  o e o r o a d i u s far his  ear ave  not esulted   as  large  n  output  ap as  might  have  been t y h r in a g expected rom  previous  stimates  f otential tput. oreover, ontinuing f e o p ou M c surprises   the  output-inflation  us  suggest  hat  igh  levels  f ncertainty in nex t h o u about  underlying  elationships sist d  may indicate  dded  caution efore r er an a b

Third,  he ecent  nflation  rformance as  probably ed  through o t r i pe h f t lower  inflation  pectations.  t oes  appear hat  nflation  pectations ve ex I d t i ex ha been  edging ower--at  east  udging  rom  the ehavior f ominal  Treasury l l j f b o n interest  tes  elative    rates  n  inflation-protected  rities.  creases n ra r to o secu De i inflation  pectations,    revalent  mong households nd  businesses   well ex if p a a as as  among bond  investors,  uld themselves  end  to old  down any  incipient wo t h increase  n nflation, east  or   time.  Moreover, eclining  nflation i i at l f a d i expectations ve  raised  eal hort-term tes  s  the ommittee has  held he ha r s ra a C t nominal  funds ate  nchanged. r u

Thus,  recent  omestic acroeconomic  developments y  themselves-d m b encompassing  the  news  on  prices  nd  productivity    well s  on resource a as a utilization--would    suggest  hat  he  case  for   rise  n he ominal  federal not t t a i t n funds  rate  ad  gotten  verwhelmingly tronger,  en  in  the bsence f h o s ev a o market  turmoil.

In  the taff recast,  e  current  evel f he ominal  funds  rate  as too s o th l o t n w low  to ontain  nflation    the eptember  Greenbook,  and  it emains  so  in c i in S r the  projections r he urrent  eeting. n important  eason or his  s hat fo t c m A r f t i t financial nditions,  oadly efined,  o  not  appear estrictive oving co br d d r or  m very  much in  that  irection,  en  after  ecent  arket  movements.

First  f ll,  f  e disaggregate e  staff's  recast  abor roductivity  to apital o a i w th fo ofl p in c deepening,  hanges  in  labor  uality,  d  total  actor  roductivity, will  ind hat  otal  actor c q an f p we f t t f productivity--the  al esidual at  ll f s  have  been  taught  o  interpret    an  embodiment  of usu r th a o u t as technological in--appears    have  risen  n  1997.

But  even  if  otal e t r to i y a t

factor  roductivity  abilizes, n he  labor roductivity  mbers that  re n  the  Greenbook,  as p st the t p nu a i best    can  judge,  re robably uch too ow.  Just sing he  internal ta hat  re ot  exactly  uilt I a p m l u t da t a n b into he  Greenbook  forecast t re  incorporated   the oard  staff's  aluation  roductivity t bu a in B ev ofp associated  ith  capital epening,  he  residual tually es  down significantly 998 and w de t ac go in  1 1999. And if  ne  were  merely  to ssume  that  otal  actor  roductivity  mains  at he  1997 level, o a t f p re t then  instead  f etting  roductivity  creases  f  1.6 ercent  n  1997,  1.2  percent  n  1998,  and  0.9 o g p in o p i i percent  n  1999,  productivity  uld  rise  rom  1.6  percent  n  1997  to  2.0 ercent  n  1998 and  2.3 i wo f i p i percent  n  1999. i

Of  course,  his  s mportant  ecause e can  have  an  increase  n  compensation er t i i b w i p hour, hich indeed   suspect  he  numbers  are howing, ithout nit  abor osts oving up  to  a w I t s w u l c m point here  they  are ressing  n  profit  argins  or  affecting e  price evel.    know we had  a w p o m th l I significant  crease  n  average ourly arnings  n  October,  ut  a  good part  f hat  as the esult in i h e i b o t w r of  overtime nd  of ix shifts,  ich  I  gather  rings  he ublished  .5  percent  onthly  figure a m wh b t p 0 m down to  0.3  percent  n  an  adjusted  asis.  nd we probably re  still  cking  p some spillover o b A a pi u from  the ise  n  the inimum  wage.

MR.  MEYER. Let  me offer  t  least    slightly  fferent  rspective.   the bsence f a a di pe In a o developments  in  Southeast  sia  and  the elated rmoil  n  world  financial rkets,    believe A r tu i ma I a 1/4  percentage  oint  ncrease  n he unds  rate  ould  have  been ustified ay. n  my judgment, p i i t f w j tod I this  ove would have  been  consistent  th  the  concerns oiced t he ast  eeting,  oncerns hat m wi v a t l m c t were reinforced   the  stronger-than-expected  wth  of DP  in  the  third  uarter,  e ecline  n by gro G q th d i the  unemployment rate  n  October,  nd  the pward revision   the  GDP  forecast r he ourth i a u to fo t f quarter.  uch  a  move would have  insured  he rocyclical  vement  in hort-term  nterest  tes S t p mo s i ra that   elieve  s o  important  o  achieving  ur  macroeconomic  objective. Ib i s t o

Let  me comment a  little   my views  on  productivity.  rankly  o not  see  anything on I  f d amiss  in he  staff recast  f   sharp lowing n  productivity  owth  next ear. DP  growth t fo o a s i gr y G slows  in hat orecast om  3.8  percent  o  2.2  percent.  f  e get he lowing n  GDP  growth t f fr t I w t s i anticipated    the  staff,  en ctual  roductivity  owth  should e  quite harply  elow  trend by th a p gr b s b productivity  owth.  The staff timate  f hat  rend ay be  a  little  gh,  ut   think  t  s gr es o t t m hi b I i i defensible.  would  not  want  to o  higher han t s. I g t i i

The second  point   would  make is hat    do  not  believe  he nticipated  duction  n I t I t a re i productivity  owth  would  be  an  important  actor  ontributing   igher  nflation.  e reason s gr f c toh i Th i

My  comments on a  set f ore balanced isks  otwithstanding,  o  believe  here  re o m r n I  d t a real  nflationary  ncerns bout  the nderlying  omentum i co a u m of  the conomy.

I  recognize  hat  n  action  ike  his  arries gnificant k.  t ould roduce  a  very t a l t c si ris I c p adverse arket  reaction.  e  could e  blamed  for hat, d  that ossibility iously  s  an m W b t an p obv i argument  for elaying  ny  move.

To be  sure,  he robability    that  utcome  may be  less po ha r f me t p of o than  50  percent--maybe  t  s ell elow  50  percent--but on't  hink t's  gligible    the urrent i i w b I  d t i ne in c environment  and  the onsequences f hat  ind  of  outcome  would be  very  undesirable.  me, c o t k To that  ould  be  the orst ase cenario, e  one  we really  eed  to  avoid.

It eems to e that  he b m a a ri i n s m t recent,  t east lative,  rket  calm  might  give  us  a  brief  indow  to ct.  I  believe  e need  to a l re ma w a w take dvantage f  it oday. a o t

MR. STERN. I, oo, upport  our  recommendation, r.  Chairman.

Let  me close ith   longer-term  hought xpressed  n  the orm  of   few  questions. w a t e i f a What are  the OMC's  intentions?  o we like eeing  nflation  low  2  percent? oes the ublic F D s i be D p know it?  I  think,   I  have  said efore,  hat  e ought o  be  more explicit  out ur  longer-term as b t w t ab o objective.   that  vent,  t  ould  be  much less ikely at  ur  actions  ould  be  misinterpreted In e i w l th o w as being  anti-jobs   anti-growth.   elieve  he ast  ive  ears f elatively  w  and  stable  nflation or Ib t l f y o r lo i have  demonstrated  o  businesses  nd  consumers  the esirability elative  ice tability. t a d ofr pr s It comes  back  to  a  comment that  erry ordan ade about ow "Main Street"  ould  perhaps e J J m h w b more supportive  f ur  moving than e might  think.    also elieve  hat  ong-term  nterest  tes o o w I b t l i ra likely  ould  be  lower ecause f   reduced  inflation  sk  remium.
