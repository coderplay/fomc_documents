Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on March 13, 2012

the CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good morning, and let me turn to Brian Sack for presentation.

gains in risky asset prices over the economic European problems would be avoided due to the aggressive liquidity MR. SACK. 1   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Investors continued to become more optimistic about the economic outlook and less concerned about the risks associated with the European situation, leading to sizable intermeeting period.  This optimism was driven in part by the incoming data, which were somewhat stronger than investors had expected.  In addition, investors grew increasingly confident that a disorderly outcome from the bank and sovereign debt policies of the ECB and the completion of the debt exchange in Greece.

more than 4 percent, as shown in your first exhibit.  Other risky assets also performed strongly, In response to these developments, equity prices increased notably since the last FOMC meeting, with the S&amp;P 500 index advancing the upper-left panel of with yield spreads on corporate bonds and some structured credit products narrowing.

assets, the 10-year Treasury yield In fact, yield has held relatively steady since last fall, even though the S&amp;P index yields reflects that policy to remain accommodative for a long period and see Despite this shift in sentiment toward riskier was little changed over the intermeeting period, as can be seen in the chart. the 10-year has risen about 15 percent over that period.  The low level of investors expect monetary some chance that the FOMC could take additional policy actions.

forward guidance about the federal funds rate in FOMC statement.  Many investors had been expecting a change to this federal funds target rate, with the highest over the intermeeting period. Over the current intermeeting period, the most important development in this regard was the strengthening of the the January guidance, but the extension to 'at least through late 2014' went beyond those expectations.  In response, as shown to the right, primary dealers pushed back the expected timing of the first increase in the probability now placed on it occurring in the second half of 2014.  Consistent with this shift, market-implied expectations for the federal funds rate beyond mid-2014 shifted down slightly policy guidance is not an tied to the evolution of economic conditions.  To a sense of how this conditionality is viewed, the dealer survey asked for the and inflation rate that would prompt the first rule, with the FOMC expected to wait for lower Market participants generally understand that the absolute commitment, but instead is get combinations of the unemployment rate increase in the federal funds target rate.

This shift suggests that the change in the forward Committee's policy reaction function, with the FOMC now expected to wait for a lower level of the unemployment rate for September survey.

It has since moved an earlier liftoff, although it remains very low by Even though the meaningful effect on the rates.  As shown to the right, the implied volatility of short-term interest rates three years ahead-the horizon roughly of the FOMC statement-moved down on the announcement, as investors saw higher chances that short-term interest rates higher, presumably because the incoming data have raised the probability that economic conditions would warrant historical standards.

The prospect that the late 2014 is clearly helping to hold down Treasury sheet policies implemented by the FOMC are premium very low.  As shown in the bottom-left panel, the 10-year term premium measured by the Kim-Wright model stands at minus 125 basis points below its average level since the even in the balance sheet actions.  These patterns suggest that there is yields could move up meaningfully at some point, particularly as a less active policy instrument or anticipate Perhaps reflecting such risk, the Analysis by the Board staff suggests that the FOMC's balance sheet actions have kept this term premium about 60 basis points lower than it would otherwise be, explaining about half of the deviation from its longer-run average.  Of course, that estimate implies that the term premium would still be unusually low absence of the FOMC's some risk that investors come to see the balance sheet as a return of more-normal interest rate uncertainty. premium on options that provide protection against a rise in interest rates has been increasing in recent months.

greater optimism about the growth outlook. The panel to the right focuses on the inflation prospects priced into the Treasury market.  As can be seen, the five-year breakeven inflation rate has moved higher, driven by increases in energy prices and However, the five-year, five-year-forward measure edged down, as longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.

actions by the ECB and related developments in asset prices have been driven in a perception that the risks related to the European situation have been contributed to this perception, the most Your next exhibit turns to recent financial markets.  As noted earlier, gains in risky part by reduced.  While several factors have likely important development has been the three-year liquidity operations (the LTROs) offered by the ECB.

LTRO offered on February 29 €800 operations offered by the ECB €1.1 trillion, with about 90 percent of that funding having a maturity of three As shown in the upper-left panel, the three-year was again met with substantial demand.  This operation, in combination with the first LTRO back in December, boosted excess liquidity in the euro area to about billion.  At this point, the total amount of funding stands at years.

These liquidity operations helped improve funding conditions for European banks, as the the substantial borrowing needs that they face over the first half of this Reflecting this improvement, the spread of three-month euro-denominated LIBOR over the OIS rate, shown to the right, has narrowed dramatically since the introduction of the term credit markets in larger size, issuing more debt over the past two months than they had over the also been notable in dollar-denominated funding markets.  As European financial institutions have to longer maturities.  Similar year's levels.  Reflecting these positive a peak of $110 billion to its current level of Improvements have shown in the chart, the dollar-denominated LIBOR-OIS spread is now well off its peak, and anecdotal evidence indicates that some been able to extend their unsecured funding in dollars improvements have been realized in the FX swap market, with the implied cost of dollar funding down sharply from last developments, the total outstanding balance for the dollar liquidity swap lines with foreign central banks has declined from $65 billion.

on bank funding conditions, the LTROs have helped allowed banks to hold larger amounts of Italian holdings of European debt following the first LTRO. In addition to its effects bring down the sovereign debt spreads for peripheral European countries, in part because the availability of this funding has that debt than they otherwise would have maintained.  The effect on sovereign yields has been more powerful than we had anticipated, with two-year Spanish and spreads, shown in the middle-left panel, now having returned to levels observed last summer.  As shown to the right, data for January show that Spanish and Italian banks did in fact increase their which investors accepted a significant reduction in the principal authorities last Friday exercised collective action clauses on those securitiesThe improvement in European sovereign debt markets occurred despite the realization of a default event on Greek debt.  Greek authorities executed a sizable debt exchange under value of their debt holdings.  To achieve sufficient participation in this exchange, the Greek

At this point, market participants appear confident that the settlement net clauses that they had development led occurred, triggering CDS contracts written on Greek sovereign debt.  The contracts will be settled following an auction process that will take place on March process will proceed without any significant problems, with about $3 billion of notional CDS to be settled.

This sector also faces a range of questions about firms' business year, they given the Despite the passing of these key events, a number of important risks surround the European situation going forward, as Steve Kamin will discuss.  These ongoing risks may be contributing to the cautious attitude that investors have regarding the U.S. financial sector. prospects and the ultimate effects of regulatory reform efforts.  These concerns appear to be reflected in the CDS spreads for major U.S. financial firms, shown in the bottom-left panel.  Although these spreads have improved since late last remain well above the levels observed in the middle of 2011.  This week, market participants are intently focused on the CCAR results that will be released, information that the results will provide about the strength of firms' balance sheets and the implications that might be drawn about their capital distribution plans.

The improvement in risk sentiment among investors, and the associated reduction in safe-haven asset demands, put modest downward pressure on the broad dollar index, as shown in the bottom-right panel.  One currency that has bucked this trend is the Japanese intermeeting period.  This movement in part reflected the recent policy decision by the Bank of Japan to increase the 1 percent inflation goal.  Market participants have also focused to a greater the erosion in Japan's trade balance, which has moved into deficit, perhaps contributing to the weakness of the

However, as I noted in my a minor modification to its purchase schedule to operate more As summarized in the upper-left panel, the Desk of the purchases and sales associated with the maturity operations have last briefing, our purchases of long-term bonds had seen a trend toward lower coverage ratios and worse prices relative to market benchmarks.

Some recent market commentary has argued that the Desk's sales of Treasury securities have year.  Reinforcing this pattern, the seasonal increase in Treasury been more substantial than expected.

However, only a small portion of this upward pressure has 11 or also be contributing to the rise in shorter-term Overnight interest rates have also come under some upward pressure.  Given the increase in supply, dealers have accumulated an unusually large stock of Treasury securities with maturities less than three collateral in the repo market, this pattern may have put upward pressure on the Treasury fed through to the federal funds rate, with that rate most recently trading at 12 basis points.  Of course, it is possible that factors other than supply, such as a reversal of safe-haven flows, may yields.

The Desk's purchases have gross issuance of TBA-eligible securities since the Other Desk operations have been focused on the payments on SOMA holdings of agency debt and MBS into MBS.  The middle-right panel shows the distribution of coupons that the Desk has purchased as distribution of principal paydowns that led to those purchases.  Not surprisingly, the portfolio continues to evolve toward lower-coupon securities, reflecting the decision to concentrate purchases constituted about 25 percent of the reinvestments began in October.

new asset purchase program concentrated in recent widening from low levels may reflect diminished These purchases have helped put downward pressure on the MBS option-adjusted spread to Treasuries, shown in the bottom-left panel.  Another factor contributing to the narrowing of the MBS basis in recent months has been the increased expectations that the FOMC would implement a MBS.  Some of the very expectations for such a program in light of the improved sentiment about the economy.

As shown to the right, the Desk's primary dealer survey indicates that the probability of 50 percent.  This reading remains substantial.  Market participants see very little chance of such a policy taking place at the

In particular, market participants have expansion in the size of the maturity

Brian, in your discussion of exhibit 1, you said that survey participants understand that our forward guidance is not an absolute commitment.  Complete absolute commitment suggests a polar case of represents a commitment; at the other extreme is something that's merely a forecast.  And it seems commitment?

My best guess is that market participants regard it as somewhat of a you mean by having made the statement that there's a slightly higher threshold to But I'm not sure it's regarded as purely a I said, as raising the threshold for deviating, at least a touch.

It may be seen, as think we've tried to communicate clearly that it's a forecast, merely a getting through to them somehow?  They view this as likely to inhibit our MR. LACKER.  I forecast.  So we're not future action?

MR. SACK.  Well, that's my best interpretation of the reading.  It's hard, exactly, to determine just how much higher that threshold is.  And they path.  You can see that because the futures well before late 2014, and the implied volatility of that shown in zero, so they

for a long time, and every one of your reports is outstanding.  I know this is way and we talked about what market expectations appear to be, given the presentation go about draining when we want in terms of the presentations made by the New York Desk staff, and the Term Deposit Facility.  I have a question about good, particularly the sophisticated folks you sense they expect us to do once we get to this position that we've rather than just keep adding on-we get to that point in the economy-what would expectation? MR. FISHER.  First, I want to thank Brian for his work.  You've been under enormous pressure premature, you made of further actions we might take.  My question has to do with-again, very prematurely-what market expectations are for how we might to drain.  And I've heard, at least that the focus would be on reverse repos that, but do you have a sense of what markets are looking for?  Most investors don't just look at one scenario; they look way down the road if they're that analyze us.  What do articulated?  Assuming, and it may be too big an assumption, that we decide we might want to start draining you say is their

FOMC minutesMR. SACK.  I think market expectations on this question have been shaped mainly by the June 2011 exit principles that were in the the ether. MR. FISHER.  Still out there in

-which stated that temporary draining tools may be used, essentially, right clear-for example, how the tools will I rate is lifted. MR. SACK. before beginning to increase the target federal funds rate.  So I think market participants anticipate that tools will be used, but they'll be used in that sequence stated in those exit principles.  Now, that leaves a lot of questions that aren't be used, just how much draining will be done, and so on.  So at this point, it's hard to judge; think they anticipate that tools will be used in some size, but that the System will still have a lot of reserves, even at the time that the target funds

I'd like us to have a fulsome discussion of I think of Professor Harold Hill in Music Man you just think through the tune, tune.  And of course, if you remember that movie, it ends up well.  The River Band marches into the room and plays Minuet in G.  It's not perfectly tuned, but it executing an exercise. MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, at some point this.  I don't want to be cheeky, but The ; it's the 'Think System.'  No need to practice playing the instrument-if you will play the City Boys' works.  We've never done this before.  We have a substantially sized balance sheet.  And I hope we can have-the timing is not right now-a very fulsome discussion of this because this is going to be quite go through time, in terms of looking at the effect of the discussions and the a view income statement according to the alternative scenarios we have that I have not seen it.  I I do have one suggestion, as we outcomes here on our balance sheet and our income statement.  Most of the articulations I've seen are on the baseline scenario.  It might be helpful now to provide for on the balance sheet and have been laid out by the staff.  I don't believe that's been done-at least

March 13, 2012

helpful, just with respect to what the sensitivities are going forward. you have all of the information or most of the information.  Again, I hope that we all can But I am concerned that we can do a great deal of going to test the system.  I know you've been how it responds.  I want to express my concern that, having not going to have to think through very carefully, using the expertise of the think that would be very And then eventually, think through aloud how this might actually happen-working with you all, because march into that room and at least play a decent tune, and it works out beautifully, and we end up with Marian, because she was the star. academic work here.

your question about the balance sheet in reference to CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Was income and capital losses?

are two points.  One is in terms of how we execute a draining we're not there.  The second point is understanding better, under MR. FISHER.  There strategy when we are ready, and alternative scenarios, what the impact is on our balance sheet and income statement of those scenarios obtaining, because right now, I believe, we base everything on the baseline scenario.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, that's not correct.  We've done lots of alternative scenarios with much higher interest rates.

shared it with the group? Yes, I think so. MR. FISHER.  Have we CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.

MR. SACK.  Yes, it was in an FOMC memo.  We actually update those projections every round for our own internal purposes.

you could share those, I would be grateful. MR. FISHER.  If

March 13, 2012

your I think it is important to realize that we face a considerable amount of uncertainty as we drain and what the right strategy should be.  And that markets act with our ability to pay interest used these tools in many regulatory and functioning of money I agree that we face many areas of uncertainty, and I think in some sense, those going to require us to learn along the way and to figure this out.  That's not to we shouldn't do as much advance planning as possible, but some of this is going to be in terms of how markets react, and we'll have to make adjustments. MR. SACK.  Could I make a few comments about the reserve draining part of question? about how markets will behave uncertainty comes because we've never observed how on reserves, except for when we've been pinned against the zero bound.  So we don't know the strength of that magnet for other short-term interest rates, and we've never large size before.  And not only that-I would add to the list that there are reform efforts under way that could substantially affect the structure markets.  So uncertainties are say that inherently unpredictable

I recall correctly, we were starting to test a little bit the reverse capability.  I was just making the simple point you obviously realize, but we're going to have to do a little bit more testing because right yet we're going to have to exercise it at some point. MR. FISHER.  And if repos, fleshing out our muscle, developing that that now, it's mostly theoretical, and couple of things.  First, we have three reserves, including the excess reserves, which, in itself.  And then, third, of course, we have asset sales, which will got a set of different tools that are complementary, and we can CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let me observe a distinct approaches to exiting.  We have the various tools for draining time deposits and the reverse repos.  We have the interest rate on theory, should work all by always work.  So we know we've use them in different combinations.

March 13, 2012

widely used around the Bank of Japan, the ECB, and others, of course, use tools like this quite successfully. I don't want to about whether we can drain, even if there is some bumpiness at some The other observation is, while we haven't done this in the United States-and, obviously, there are institutional differences and so on-these are very world.  The So, again, there may be institutional factors we have to take into account, but overstate the uncertainty point.

one of the reasons I was curious as to what the market seems to as well. MR. FISHER.  That was be expecting us to do, too, because we have to deal with that factor

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sure.

'guidance' is too strong a word-at least MR. FISHER.  And perhaps provide-maybe some orientation for fleshing out those expectations.

The signaling problem is very difficult.  I note that exit, which we intended just to reassureCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes. when we put out last summer the principles of a framework. MR. FISHER.  Provide

-the general view is that we were basically ready to exit at careful about how we communicate.  President Bullard. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. that point.  And so we have to be very you, Mr. Chairman.  Brian, as usual, a crisp and excellent Would Prompt First Rate Hike.'  I'm looking at this lower-left corner here, that the market, I guess, thinks that we would raise rates if headline inflation was and unemployment was 6½ percent.  I'm not sure how to interpret that. MR. BULLARD.  Thank presentation here.  I have a couple of questions on exhibit 1, panel 3, 'Macroeconomic Conditions That which says 1 percent

I said in my remarks, the slope of reflecting the type of tradeoff you would have in a Taylor rule.  And MR. SACK.  I think you interpreted it correctly.  As this line could be seen as

March 13, 2012

you would get if you (1999) rule to this.  So I think that just reflects the tradeoff that the FOMC got relatively low if inflation were running at that low actually, in terms of magnitude, the slope is not that different from what apply the Taylor would wait until the unemployment rate level.

It just strikes me as a bit of a mismatch between, maybe, I think the Committee would actually do in that circumstance, we have talked a lot about disinflation pressures or deflationary pressures.  When we've in the past, that's made everybody nervous, including me.  And so I MR. BULLARD.  All right. market expectations and what because gotten close to 1 percent don't know if it's a mismatch or not.

variables. MR. SACK.  Well, to state the obvious, this is a very oversimplified version of the reaction function, which was noted in the written comments.  So, clearly, market participants see a number of other factors affecting the timing, not just these two

On exhibit 1, panel 6, 'Breakeven Inflation Rates,' five-year gone up.  You cited energy prices in part.  I think that over a five-year time horizon, you can cite energy prices over a five-year time horizon as driving those inflation MR. BULLARD.  Okay. rates have like us, they would see through energy price movements that are perceived to be transitory.  So I'm not sure expectations.

Well, if you just mechanically measure the effects on headline CPI from the some MR. SACK. rise in futures prices, and don't assume a full reversal of those energy prices, then you get effect.

MR. BULLARD.  So you'd say, to the extent that energy price increases are very persistent or permanent, that would feed through.

MR. SACK.  Right-and have some persistence.  Correct.

currently, your staff estimate is that the LSAPs what our balance sheet is going to look like the next several years, with exit at, say, late 2014 for the funds rate, how do you see the path LSAPs over the next couple of years?  Or specifically, what do you think the LSAPs will be on the 10-year Treasury yield, say, at the end of 2014? MR. WILLIAMS.  Yes, I have a question on exhibit 1, panel 5-on the term premium on the 10-year Treasury.  Brian, I think you said that are pushing down the term premium on the 10-year Treasury by 60 basis points.  So my question, then, is, given our baseline scenario for over for this effect of the effect of the

WASCHER. 2   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'll be referring to the one in the packet labeled 'Forecast Summary.'  In putting together our forecast this round, we've had to grapple with some unusual tensions in the current macroeconomic situation as portrayed by the available data-notably, that the information on the labor by the information on spending.  Those tensions were only underscored by data.  The indicators of spending received since the January Tealbook have something of a mixed bag, with the news on housing markets and business a little stronger than we weaker on net.

Meanwhile, in the household survey, the unemployment rate was unchanged at 8.3 percent, holding last not materially stronger than we had expected in the March Tealbook, the tone of the reports for January forecast we provided you in January.  In addition, manufacturing January came in well above our expectations.

However, this moderately unexpected weakness in consumer spending.  Apart from motor vehicles, real personal consumption expenditures looked to be coming in well below our expectations, leading us to mark down our projection for real PCE growth this quarter to an annual rate of just 1¼ percent.  I would note, however, that this morning's sales report looks to be stronger than we were expecting to revise the PCE forecast up somewhat.

But given the still relatively downbeat consumer sentiment figures and the likelihood that rising gasoline prices will restrain household spending in coming months, we kept our adjustment pretty small.  In particular, our Tealbook forecast moving up from an annual rate of 1¾ percent in the first quarter to 2¼ percent in the second, leaving point higher than in the January Tealbook.

One way to illustrate this risk is with our factor model, which we highlighted in a box in the Tealbook.  The forecast of the model is shown in the bottom-left panel of the exhibit, and I've updated it to include information from Friday's merchandise trade you can see, relative to at the time of the January Tealbook, the first-quarter prediction factor model has changed little, mainly because it places a signal from production and employment data, and, as a This factor model extracts in a purely statistical fashion information about the state of the business cycle from a large and diverse set of economic indicators, most of them at higher frequency than the quarterly GDP data.  As the predictions made of GDP growth from the large weight on the incoming spending data.  Going forward, however, the model takes substantially more result, the model's prediction for GDP growth in the second quarter has revised up to 4 percent.

Along with the somewhat brighter tone of the and a stronger projection for economic Turning to the medium-term projection, as illustrated in the upper-left panel, we marked up our second half of this incoming labor market data, these upward revisions incorporate the positive effects of a lower foreign exchange value of the dollar growth in our trading partners, which Steve will talk about shortly.  In addition, we revised up our forecast for the stock market.  The increase in oil prices since the last projection provides a partial offset.

As in recent Tealbooks, we continue to see significant headwinds facing the economy, including ongoing worries about the European situation, a slow pace availability and in the housing market, and a substantial drag from year.  In our projection, these factors combine to hold real GDP about 2½ percent in 2012 and 2¾ percent in 2013, not much above the assumed rate of growth in potential output.

Fallick highlighted in his briefing for the Board yesterday, the persistent As Bruce downtrend in the unemployment rate since last summer prompted us to confront another tension that has been building for some time-how to explain the sizable

real GDP.  The basic puzzle is illustrated in a very simple way by the chart changes in the unemployment rate over the past 20 years.  Clearly, this one, but the error in 2011 looks to be especially large. decline in the unemployment rate since late 2010 in the context of relatively modest growth in in the lower-right panel, which plots four-quarter against four-quarter percent changes in real GDP relationship isn't a tight recession and recovery periods.  In particular, in the depths of the financial would have given the declines in output.  This interpretation of the data is an year relative to the change in real We can think of a number of potential explanations for this puzzle.  But the one that we find most compelling relates to the dynamics of employment and productivity during the crisis and deep recession, firms may have been so alarmed by ongoing and prospective declines in demand that they cut payrolls by considerably more than they ordinarily consistent with the observation on the chart for 2009, which shows that there was unusually large rise in the unemployment rate that GDP.

years into their cyclical and structural components, we may have assigned too much permanence to the large productivity gains observed in gains in those earlier years was decline in the unemployment rate reversing part of their earlier workforce levels. This interpretation also suggests that, in parsing the changes in labor productivity over the past few previously 2009.  Indeed, based on the substantial deceleration in productivity that occurred in 2011, it now appears that a smaller fraction of the sustainable.  Accordingly, our current view of the since late 2010 is that firms have been reductions in order to bring productivity back to more sustainable our supply-side projection, one implication is that the year. From the perspective of level of structural productivity-and hence potential output-was lower in recent years than we had previously assumed.  The specific adjustments we made resulted in an output gap that is ½ percentage point narrower than in the January projection, thereby bringing it roughly into alignment with our estimate of the unemployment gap by the end of last

I noted earlier, there are other potential explanations as well, that real GDP growth last year will eventually be lines up reasonably well with the improvement shown by clues about the direction of future mismeasurement, although I would we are telling is the right one, our ability to calibrate the size at the end of last year.  Indeed, the continued decline in Of course, as including the possibility that the decline in unemployment is overstating the improvement in the labor market or revised up.  However, we have no real basis for discounting the drop in the unemployment rate, as it other labor market indicators.  And, at present, the information on gross domestic income, to which we have looked in the past for GDP revisions, does not suggest any substantial add that GDI has not always been a reliable guide.  Finally, I would caution that even if the qualitative story and timing of these dynamics is far from perfect, and we cannot be certain that we have the alignment right unemployment this quarter may suggest that the 'catch-up' in hiring persisted into this year.

The biggest news here, of course, has been the run-up in gasoline prices in recent But we've also received incoming data on core prices that were a little above above 2 percent over the first half of this year, more than Turning to prices, the two middle panels of the exhibit summarize our projection for headline rise in crude oil prices and the accompanying weeks. our expectations.

However, the upward revisions to PCE inflation and the narrower GDP gap in the liftoff from the effective Of course, other policy rules imply both earlier and later liftoff dates.

In the end, I conclude that, even though prospects for the region had improved, the European crisis remains the key driver of the foreign economic outlook.

Accordingly, we are now a euro-area recession that is shorter and shallower than in the January confidence have moved back up since edging up 1 percent next year, a dismal-but not horrific-performance. We take all of these risks very seriously.  Nevertheless, we still judge outlook for Europe's projecting forecast.  This revision also reflects better data than we had anticipated earlier.

All told, our projection over the higher than in the January well as the stronger recent announcement that it growth target from 8 percent to 7½ percent.  Since the 8 percent was established in 2005, China's growth has averaged a much higher been predicting a slowdown to a steady years, even before China's announcement.

We U.S. economy to spikes in oil prices.  Jim Hamilton has done equivalent sense of the sensitivity of the European economy to strong spikes coming from geopolitical events?

We have indeed done some analysis on that.  And I should say that there that make it difficult to be very certain United States' economy is more oil-dependent than is efficiency of oil use.  It's also true that the United States has lower specific prices in Europe than in the United States.  On the other hand, the United States I guess the analysis that likely applies to Europe, too. MR. KAMIN. are some different crosscurrents in terms of the effects about these effects.  On the one hand, the Europe's in terms of taxes on oil use, so a given increment to oil prices results in a smaller percentage increase in retail gasoline has less import dependence than Europe.  Europe imports just about all of its oil, while in the U.S., it's not a full 100 percent.  So these factors offset each other. we've done to date suggests that the U.S. economy is probably more vulnerable to an oil price shock than the advanced foreign economies, in general.  And that We'll probably need to do more analysis on that.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions?  President Bullard.

March 13, 2012

you, Mr. Chairman.  On the forecast summary, the bottom-right Changes in Real GDP and Unemployment since 1990'-this is a statement of I'm going to do some ocular regression here.  One thing that has struck me about goes very high during recessions and drifts down are not all recession years in this picture.  So one hypothesis that you might have is from a few data points that are really the you throw those five points out, you'd probably get a horizontal that there's not much of a relationship for the expansion periods.  So I would when labor market relationships are disturbed a lot, and things break you're growing at 2 percent or 3 percent or 4 percent.  What do you think of that? MR. BULLARD.  Thank panel, 'Q4/Q4 Okun's law. the data is that unemployment obviously slowly during expansions.  And you can see that in this picture to some degree because the two dots that are far up in the left part of this panel, plus probably the three black dots that labeled, are likely just that a lot of the fit of this regression is coming recession data points.  And if line that would say see recessions as a time down, and then they just slowly recover during the expansion periods.  But it doesn't matter too much whether Probably not much.

is certainly true.  Over the last three 1990s, the jobless recovery after the 2001 with earlier recessions, where you unemployment come down much more quickly.  So there is a question of whether there's regime change in this Okun's law relationship since, say, the late 1980s or the MR. WASCHER.  I think your observation that, obviously, unemployment goes up a lot during recessions and has come down more slowly recessions, we saw the jobless recovery in the early recession, and then again this time as well.  And that contrasts saw been some sort of 1990s.  And that's something we're thinking about and working on.

I'd note is that for each of those recessions, we can point to may have resulted in that kind of pattern.  For example, in the 2001 At this point, the other thing idiosyncratic factors that

for firms putting that high-tech equipment in place.  And so the gains that went along with it came later, and that contributed to a big boost in period.  It's not as obvious in the early 1990s, you think about whether there's a regime change or not, I think the most an extraordinary event.  And even if there is a regime change, the story about firms becoming so frightened about the prospects that they really slashed during the recession is probably still there. period, running up to that, there was this big high-tech boom, and it looked as though there were some adjustment costs productivity productivity and a slower rise in employment that but there are stories of something similar, when firms reorganized their management and organizational systems to eliminate some middle management.  And in this period, obviouslyregardless of what recent period, clearly, is we're telling employment quite sharply good observations that you make. would say that this is a work in progress, and we're still thinking about how we should be So, again, we're thinking about these issues.  Those are I modeling our Okun's law relationship.

It seems as though it goes the other way, because we've pretty strong GDP recoveries but surprisingly slow declines in Is that fair?  But in this case, we're getting a weak GDP growth and a sharper CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. seen in recent recessions unemployment. decline in unemployment.

I may not you'll interpret it correctly and in a sensible way.  You gotten stronger employment than we thought but continued with an GDP data come out, an upward revision in both income and unit labor costs.  We continue to get the pretty year.  I guess there will be another revision of you point out. economy is evolving do your view about the forecast into a somewhat more positive framework?  Is it get final revisions of GDP to convince you that maybe growth was created every month? understand where the staff's tipping point is to begin to take a stronger path on right now, you seem to be inching it up, but with some So at what point, and how do you think about taking it on board more? MR. PLOSSER.  Yes, the same theme but going in a little different direction. ask this question quite right, so maybe posed the issue about, well, we've weak growth-the issue we've been talking about.  So over the last several months-actually, most of the fall-we kept having revisions up in employment data.  They come out initial number, and there's been this string of upward revisions.  When the we see strong employment numbers into the first of the GDP coming up later this month for the fourth quarter.  I understand the risks that What I'm trying to ask is, at what point in your thinking about how the you begin to shift going to take until we underestimated?  How much longer would you need of 250,000 jobs being I'm trying to board in your forecast, because reluctance.

MR. WASCHER.  Right.  I think we see the tensions as fairly uncertain.  What we haven't seen that we'd spending side, the incoming spending data.  The big GDP revisions we'll when they do the annual up getting revised up more or not.  But much just because we haven't seen the strength in consumer spending, in particular, demand, in general, that

I think that's right.  Again, as I noted, we're really uncertain if our doing some catch-up hiring to make up for the big job cuts earlier. on, and I would think we're weighing that as a possible risk.  That itself an alternative simulation, which I think could be going on and that we just haven't picked up yet.  But from the perspective of MR. WASCHER. story is right in terms of firms That could still be going will generate some income gains and some additional consumption, but we'd like to see more support from the spending data in terms of our baseline forecast.  We have, obviously, put in an upside-risk forecast in the Tealbook as something that's our baseline forecast, we've basically been reluctant to move up a lot because of the lack of supporting information on the spending side.

Just to build on what Bill said, when we put the forecast to try to make the story could have gone further to try to better align what we saw on the were implicitly this summer when benchmark, we could easily find ourselves having higher output in 2011 would have had to revise down potential GDP even more.  So we were trying, I think, you're describing. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. together and we were deciding how much to revise down potential output hang together more, we employment side with the spending side, but we didn't, in part because we putting weight on the idea that we could get data revisions.  But, say, come the BEA does its annual than we saw.  So we definitely did not dismiss that possibility.  We're putting some sort of probability on that event.  We would not be shocked to find out that GDP did grow more strongly in 2011 than the published data now show.  If we had dismissed that entirely, we probably to do that filtering exercise that

Yes. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.

So, again, as I mentioned, the uncertainty about Europe, the problems slow improvement in credit markets, the big fiscal restraint that going to come on next year-that suggests to us that a moderate pace of MR. WASCHER. in the housing market, only looks as though it's recovery is our best baseline forecast.

you.  President Kocherlakota. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank which I In some sense, what you're trying to do is to figure out how much is characterizing things.  My question is, your inflation forecast relative to actual your revisions for potential output?  As I look at page 34 of staff's forecast, unemployment doesn't look than what the staff forecast.  So, to make my question sharp, to what of inflation enter into your thinking about what potential output is? MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, I wanted to follow up on this line of questioning, think is quite interesting. supply, how much is demand.  That's a very loose way of to what extent do you think about the performance of inflation when you're thinking about the Tealbook A, which tracks the evolution of the that bad.  On real GDP, the economy has underperformed relative to what the staff forecast, and inflation has been higher extent does the behavior

use is so flat. MR. WASCHER.  It does enter in.  I think the problem is that taking much signal from inflation is difficult because the Phillips curve that we

It's very flat, isn't it?  Yes. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.

It's hard to know.  There are other things that are affecting inflation as I think it's just hard to know how much signal to take from that.  So we do look at it; it is MR. WASCHER. well. part of our system in terms of estimating potential output.

March 13, 2012

the box 'Framework for Board Staff Inflation Projections.'  What's the beta MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Bill, how flat is it?  You've probably told me this before.  On page 30, you have in that regression?

The beta in the regression that was actually used to do the simulations MR. WASCHER. is 0.065.

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Okay.

think that's a little bit hard to interpret.  It depends on the lag MR. WASCHER.  But I structure.  In a model that has longer lags of inflation, it's something closer to 0.2.

another point, I think, worth mentioning on page 34, most weight on now I would describe as saying, look, longer-run are very well anchored.  If you go back to 2010, we allowed much more we went through the course of 2010, we didn't see that happen.  We go just stayed remarkably flat no matter what.  And so we've implicitly you look at that picture, I think that's a major effect on our thinking.  Plus, also incoming data at the time and that sort of stuff.  But at that time, we were that we would end up at 1 percent, as opposed to, once we were in 2011 and today, that it's just remarkable how well anchored expectations are and that we will tend to-I 2 percent as the economy comes out of the slump. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  There's which shows the evolution of the change in our forecast over time.  I think it's fair to say that if you went back to the forecasts that were made in 2010, the weights we were putting on different models have evolved since then.  And so the model that we are putting the is the one that's described in the box, which inflation expectations scope to the idea that longer-run inflation expectations would get dragged down in the course of this deep recession.  As into 2011, and expectations shifted our weight.  If there were thinking thinking won't call it levitate up-just gravitate back to We really upped our weight on that view of the world.

I'd like evolution you just described, you still are forecasting inflation to return to 1½ pretty soon and stay there a size of the gap trumps the stability of expectations still.

because of the high level of the gap.  So that's MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Right, it's holding down compensation and marginal costs and so on and so forth, and that's keeping inflation subdued.  But as that fades, you go back to 2 percent.

of thinking about the forecast, if you thought that there was less slack than we or alternatively, if you thought the unemployment rate was going to you had our you had a different model, you'd have another, different inflation forecast.

It doesn't seem like an unreasonable forecast to me because if is about 2 percent over labor costs rising at 1 percent a year. pressures were to abate, you could see inflation somewhat below 2 percent for a while.

MR. PLOSSER.  Just a quick clarification.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.

do you then construct your headline forecast?  And, two, in the Phillips curve model that regarding the shocks to oil and commodities that may enter into this as special are zero-mean shocks, or do they have a mean that's different than In principle, if your inflation forecast was 2 percent and that was your target, and you a zero-mean-distribution variable, you may have the wrong wondering how those two things interact and you construct your headline PCE forecast. MR. PLOSSER.  Your assumptions about the behavior of oil prices and commodity prices-you're forecasting core and not headline, in some sense.  I have two questions.  One is, how you have here, factors, do you assume they zero? treated the inflation movements as mean for the distribution of those shocks.  So I'm then, ultimately, how

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are we ready to start our go-round?  Why don't we start with the Vice Chairman?

certainly agree that the outlook has growth side, I think I would cite three things.  First, the employmentthat we've taken the worst case at least temporarily off a real risk that they were going to spiral down and have a really massive seem to have taken that off the table, at least and supportive VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you.  I improved.  On the confidence nexus is now evolving in a more positive way.  Second, as Steve Kamin mentioned, regarding the European situation, it seems the table.  That was the situation where the banks and sovereigns were interrelated in a very bad way, and there was credit crunch on Europe.  The LTROs of the ECB for now.  And third, financial conditions have eased, and I view that as significant of economic growth.

of GDP growth in Q4 and Q1 looks to be around 2½ percent.  On gains that we're getting, as the staff has made clear, the rise in hours worked is growth, not because GDP growth is very strong.  So if we forward momentum on the demand side, then the labor going to abate on its own accord. But having said all that, I wouldn't get very excited about it.  U.S. growth is still pretty disappointing.  The average employment mainly due to very weak productivity return to trend productivity without faster market improvement that we're seeing is

I would mention is that growth may be being boosted temporarily by weather.  The population-weighted heating degree days were The second thing unseasonably mild minus 14 percent in January and minus 14 percent in February compared with the long-term

There's a lot of dispersion around that, so I wouldn't want to take this too literally, but it seems that the boosting effects offset the depressing effects. probably lifting

I would note is that the impact of higher gasoline prices that we've talked personal income growth lies ahead of us.  It hasn't really happened yet, gone up, up to now that's been offset by lower gas prices, lower electricity rates, and the mild winter weather.  So in terms of the amount yet from the gasoline prices.  I think the Iran oil sanctions do create the risk of a channels:  one, an increase in precautionary potential for supply disruptions.

generate employment opportunities in construction The idea here is that we're actually going to see a structural increase going forward, compared with where we were in the last cycle, and a higher in the housing boom who were employed during the boom period aren't going to be able to find jobs. Finally, I want to touch on one other topic that's come up over time in this venue:  The question is, did the housing boom essentially that will never exist again? in unemployment NAIRU, because people going to get reabsorbed back into the labor market and aren't the construction industry in some detail and asked ourselves the is different in terms of difficulties of construction you a couple of data rate, and we found that the job-finding rate for people So we actually looked at question, are there any signs that this industry workers finding employment?  And the bottom line:  We found that construction workers have fared no worse, and often better, than other occupations.  So let me just give points.  First, we looked at the job-finding

March 13, 2012

was very similar to those for other occupations until late 2010.  Since actually been a greater improvement in construction than in other occupations into Is there more exit from construction workers who are just leaving the it was actually less than other food preparation, transportation, and production, which are the kinds of can't find employment. in the construction area then, there's which construction workers move if they can't find work in construction.  Second, we looked at exit from the labor force. labor force because they're discouraged?  And we found that occupations, such as occupations that construction workers move into if they looks at actually happening to those workers.  We found was unemployed in construction, you look at the you find that 48.8 percent are employed overall, and for construction, currently employed.  So it's about the same.  The bottom line is construction workers are somehow going to get jobs again.  At least based on climbed because these really very little support for that in the Thank you. And then finally, we looked at the displaced worker survey, which basically people who have lost their jobs and at what's that in construction, a slightly higher proportion than average but a lower proportion had actually dropped out of the labor force altogether.  If displaced worker survey, 46.9 percent of the people are that there doesn't seem to be any evidence that unemployable, that they're stuck, that they're never our analysis, the idea that the structural unemployment rate has somehow construction workers aren't going to get jobs-there's data currently.

Focusing on financial and labor market conditions, one might conclude that the

However, my enthusiasm is financial pillars, particularly the outlook for Europe.  Peripheral European countries seem to be consistently missing deficit projections, rising unemployment in many European countries threatens both economic improvement in financial fundamentals is primarily changes in the fundamentals of these economies.

Labor market conditions have also improved.  Firms seem more confident that the domestic economy is on the mend, which is reflected in the improved payroll employment numbers over the past three months.  Again, however, there are reasons to be cautious.  While residential investment seems to be improving, construction employment declined in February.

Government employment in February declined by only 6,000 jobs, but future cuts remain quite likely employment.  Furthermore, the employment-to-population ratio for those aged 25 to 34 in February was 74.7, still more than 4 percentage points lower than it was four these employment figures can turn around quickly if demand doesn't follow suit soon.  Just witness the beginning of recovery, real final been growing at only a 1.7 percent rate, not much different than what I expect for this are reasons to be optimistic.

I always do, on what I'm hearing from operators in the field; and, very good report, and also bearing in mind, before he leaves the room, Governor and yours that we must beware of 'false dawns.' MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'm going to, first, make a comment about my District; second, report, as third, make a comment on inflation, bearing in mind the two previous interlocutors, who I thought gave a Tarullo's warning

Still, we're being coming into our District.  It could be that unusual seasonal factors asked our staff to look at this very hard again.  But our conduct-the manufacturing survey, the retail survey, and the service-sector Beige Book soundings for February are pointing to a strengthening labor I might add that our Manufacturing Outlook Survey has the highest correlation of all least from the my numbers are accounted for about 20 percent of the nation's job growth in January.  We'll see what Against that background, in the fact that we and point out that payroll employment rose at a robust rate of 6.7 percent You have to take the BLS data-and it takes about a month after the labor report, as and we period we've seen since 45-year history of this series. earlier-mostly schoolteachers, by the way-which is the one sector that still is struggling. unemployment rate is at a 32-month low of 7.3 percent.

So at standpoint of an unusual District, we're lucky, but it's broad based.  And if right, we happens in February.

That comprehensive, and numbers in the 11 sectors that they report, the best January and February in two years.  Eleven out of the 11 retail sectors that are followed had increases that ranged from 14 gasoline sales, which those surprise me-down to 0.7 percent for department stores, which does seems to be the area that's weakest.

The big food distributors have actually managed to push through a price increase of 3 to 4 percent.  But this is done mainly noticed recently-having learned from Bush 41 that one should know the prices of things themselves-in looking at what is now considered to be a half-gallon of orange juice by the major price.  This is done through what they call weighting in the business.  It certainly is bifurcated math at work in retail.  The higher-income stores sales.

Now that, by the way, feeds in to our you look, for example, at ethane costs, they're down for the petrochemical producers, so we're seeing a boom in natural-gas-produced comparative advantage as a country relative to Europe.

With regard to gasoline prices, which I mentioned or threatened to come back to, I think it's important to realize that, given the seasonality factor that was applied using the Department of the impact.  I think we should just be prepared from a presentational standpoint to see a pretty big effect evident in the

I would add also, with regard to the the operators of that the European banks have Bank, for example, which any shipper anywhere in the world throughout lending to anybody among the French banks.  You market happens to be Mexico.  They're going to stay there.  But when it comes to their been pulling back, and they're getting closer to their customer base.  I So that's the extent of my impact of Europe, we hear about it when we talk to people in the field-that is, business; it's still amorphous.  One thing that's pretty clear is drawn back.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And then, lastly, I think we should probably drill further down in terms of outside the financial contagion trade of And of course, you have exports to Europe, which are 13 percent or so of our exports roughly five-sixths of that goes to the core to spend some more time on those data.  I don't wish to discuss it now, but an amorphous concern.  You hear less ill defined.  And I don't risk, but we can't quite put our fingers on exactly

Lockhart. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President upbeat statements on current conditions and expectations.  Most reports Lending activities by banks, while still soft, are growing, and especially MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In the Sixth District, grassroots intelligence suggests more upside potential than is evident in the accumulating data, which themselves have been, on balance, positive and encouraging.  In our most recent cycle of contacts, we heard quite on consumer spending were positive, certainly stronger than the January data indicated.  Sales of home appliances, furniture, and autos were described as especially strong.  Reports by firms of rising order books were consistent with improving measured manufacturing activity in the Southeast.  We heard reports of an uptick in corporate interest and business fixed investment projects, and more of this activity seems to be capital expansion aimed at growth opportunities as opposed to replacement.

So even though performance improving, we heard that this may not translate into new hiring in the near term for many economic growth projection and the Board staff's are now essentially the more confident of measures of inflation rising We see less influence of economic slack as a restraint on the from our pre-meeting business increases coming soon if the upside potential can be characterized as a Turning to the national outlook and the comparison of my forecast to that of the Tealbook, Atlanta's same after the modest upward revision in this meeting's Tealbook.  We differ from the Tealbook outlook as regarding inflation.  We in Atlanta are to the Committee's target. underlying price trend.  My outlook projects headline and core inflation near our 2 percent objective over the near and medium terms.  In support of this view, it's worth noting that we heard mention of potential bottlenecks in a number of industries contacts.  We heard growing expectations of price to economic activity materializes.  One of my directors said that prices coiled spring.  The idea is that businesses that have heretofore been suffering margin squeeze will react quickly to raise prices if the recovery accelerates and demand picks up noticeably.

That said, most do not feel they have much pricing power in the current environment.

More-upbeat consumer sentiment and a markets also help.  However, as the Tealbook describes quite well, the to be translating into robust GDP growth over the next few Vice Chairman Dudley and President complacency and the trap of lower expectations. little better, are nowhere near satisfactory.  Our policy hole Tealbook's rather conservative analysis now puts the output gap at 5 percent 33 months after the trough of the Great Recession.  The outlook is seriously inconsistent with our mandate, in my opinion.  GDP growth at output gap, and the pickup in growth that we are projecting still 3 percent at the end of 2014.  The Tealbook analysis works hard to provide a fair balanced approach to estimating the output the gap is zero.  Uncertainty also means it could be larger.  The Tealbook's potential output analysis is supported by the lack of inflation projections above our long-run objective; I share that view of projected inflation.  Putting all of this together, it seems like a pretty heavy burden to convincingly demonstrate that the output gap today is much smaller than 5 percentage points, and that it will be acceptably small by late 2014.

My contacts tell me that only now, in 2012, does a sustainable orders are growing, and they are finally confident expansion path, but they data invites some optimism, my projection for the economy is still considerably less were all forecasting much stronger growth for encouraged that my contacts suggest that economic expect the trajectory to be lower. While the incoming data about the trajectory recovery, they expected things to get better quickly usually bounces back after a recession.  As this recovery has progressed, they learned not to take the recovery process for expansion seem to be taking hold.  Their enough to resume some hiring.  Still, some have commented that despite the general improvement in business conditions, their customers are still cautious.  Overall, my business contacts have become more confident that the economy is on a stable don't anticipate vigorous growth and they remain cautious.  So while the strengthening of incoming robust than it was last year at this time, when we this year.  On a more hopeful note, I am growth is on firmer footing this time around, even if they greater resilience in the economy.  Indeed, gains of the last few months have lowered my unemployment rate projection by year and next, but again, compared with our projections last For some time, I have also been concerned that the who might reenter the labor force as the economy recovers.  To The interesting result was that, a pickup in labor force The labor market is hinting at the potential for the employment almost ½ percentage point this spring, unemployment still remains high. unemployment rate could decline more slowly than I had projected, in light of the larger numbers of people out of the labor force assess this concern, my staff conducted some analysis, including labor force participation and its trend in a standard vector autoregression forecasting model. based on past recovery patterns, better GDP growth would likely foster

Unlike growth projections, when compared with March of last year, I'm expecting slightly I'm projecting 1.8 percent for this year, recent jump in oil and gasoline prices, so far I've spike that we saw in energy prices in 2008. prices have been near flat, and household ample supply of natural gas are actually down 1.2 percent over the last six and motor fuel have almost equal weights in the from gasoline prices.

For example, we need another couple growth like we've seen in the last few months-and those have been very recover the employment are a variety of factors holding back the economy, and clearly housing is a big part and economic activity Of course, we have three of the hardest-hit states in terms of the are also recession.

My staff has examined the correlation between home prices on a state-by-state level. housing crash.  It's not surprising that the states with the largest declines in house prices the ones that were hit hardest by the employment and the biggest increases in unemployment, and such results are consistent with academic studies that find clear links at the state level and at the local level between bust and the severity of the recession.  But what's interesting is that what held during the recession actually hasn't correlation between house price declines and

economic recovery do not half years since the recovery across all the states points to obstacles to economic Some of these obstacles are clearly related to are only indirectly related, including tight economic uncertainty.  This indicates that economic growth is likely to be factors, not only by troubled local housing markets.  So in terms of where households cannot refinance or are otherwise constrained by their balance sheets, policy could fuel well general recovery across the country. year, for example, job growth was about the same in those states that had large house price declines and those that did not.  More generally, recent indicators of show unusual dispersion across states.  In fact, today, more than two and a recovery began, the unemployment rate is higher in every single state than it was before the recession.  The meager pace of growth that are largely nationwide in nature. housing and household balance sheets, but others credit and pervasive restricted by national monetary policy, this evidence addresses one concern-that monetary policy has no traction in areas but lots of traction elsewhere.  If that were true, then stimulative monetary regional imbalances by overheating some local markets.  But instead, given the common headwinds and widespread output shortfalls across the country, monetary policy appears suited to try to promote view that we are still in the midst of a fragile forecast for real GDP growth remains at 2.4 percent for this year and risks to this forecast lie predominantly to the downside. ones that emanate from beyond our shores-they've already been no shortage of global threats to growth.

However, oil prices are likely to level out or even edge down a bit next year, expect PCE inflation to fall to about 1½ percent next year. Let me potential output, like many macro exercises, is always an uncertain exercise, and estimates evolve based on new information.  So I thought it would be useful to look back and to see to what extent our estimates of potential output have provides a perspective on the extent to which we think the shocks to the economy have been to supply or demand.  Our own calculations at the San Francisco Fed, constructed from a bottom-up production function accounting similar to that in the Tealbook, suggest that there have been significant downward supply-side attribute about half of the current shortfall of real revision of aggregate supply and about half to a shortfall in aggregate demand.  Now, just to be clear, our estimate of the shortfall is consistent with a that also point to high levels of slack remaining, which should restrain the price pressures forward.  Unquestionably, the recent jump in crude oil prices is temporarily inflation and will continue to do so in coming months.  So I foresee PCE price inflation around 2 percent this and given the high degree of slack, I

For manufacturing firms, growth in the service contacts many an aside, I Dudley's report on the data fascinating, but I'm not sure that if a lack of employment growth, there'd be a differential effect on different data MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Recent data and reports from the Fifth Federal Reserve District business activities picked up pace despite some headwinds, and revenue sector continued in February, although slightly less broadly than in previous months.  According to our surveys, job growth is also broadening in both manufacturing and services.  Our have increasingly reported adding net new workers in recent weeks, particularly in the IT sector but also for other professional jobs and skilled manufacturing positions.  I'm not sure how of these were formerly construction workers.  We'll have to ask in a future survey.  As found Vice Chairman skills was restraining occupations in terms of their unemployment experience.  So I need to think about these some more.

So, on balance, in the Fifth District we're seeing signs of a broadening array of sectors, and I'd characterize the reports as similar in Lockhart reported for the Sixth District. Construction of new residential housing showed signs of improvement.  The mild weather the overall levels of standards.  Contacts also leasing, particularly improvement across tenor to what President we've seen in the Fifth District is also apparent in the national data, I thinklast six months.

Despite that, the to around 1½ percent, as we discussed year and next.  Both the and the market-based measures of inflation expectations seem to me more aligned with 2 been for energy prices staff noted in their special box.  So I suspect that core inflation is more The staff was wise to raise the projection for core inflation over the forecast horizon, although, personally, I think they should have following the string of firm readings in the first half of 2011, the monthly numbers have been steadily increasing since September, and in fact, the latest reading an annual rate, in line with the three-month and the staff persists in forecasting a decline in core inflation earlier.  Personally, I'd be surprised if we actually get such a decline this surveypercent inflation than with rates below that.  Moreover, we know that overall inflation will move higher this spring, if only because of the gasoline prices that we've already seen at the pump and that are in train.  And the broad pattern over the last couple of decades has to bleed into core, as the likely to rise than fall in coming quarters, in which case we may find it challenging to keep inflation expectations anchored near 2 percent.

Longer term, however, signs of a strengthening economy increasingly positive.

And while activity in the housing market remains at very low levels, rebounding household formation should help with the recovery of this important sector. sluggish than in the Tealbook, I have revised up my medium-term forecast and project a brighter outlook for growth than the Tealbook, coupled with substantially more improvement in the unemployment rate over

Minnesota provides a great illustration of how hard it is to gaps.  In some ways, slack seems small in Minnesota.  The unemployment rate forecasting that it will be below 5 percent by year.  Vacancies in the fourth quarter of 2011 in Minnesota were as large as in the I think my home state of measure output has fallen to 5.6 percent, and my staff is currently the end of the fourth quarter of 2007.  Just as a sidebar, while President Williams is right that all states are

March 13, 2012

elevated unemployment relative to 2007, there is a wide range of experiences about unemployment being back down below its 2007 level end of the year.  To go on, in Minnesota, we've heard persistent reports of 3 percent wage reports of 4 percent wage increases.  All these signs would point to But at the same time, one could also argue that slack is large, experiencing across that elevation.  North Dakota would be quite different from Nevada, and in Minnesota, as I've just talked about, we're thinking by the increases and occasional relatively little slack in this state. because inflation-adjusted per capita income in Minnesota remains below its 2007 level.

I would say that recent-to use President in the right direction.  I So, what evidence leads 5.3 percent that's in the Tealbook?  First, average weekly hours, as measured by the current establishment survey, are essentially back to 2007 levels.  Second, the fraction of people who have been unemployed for less than six months is down to 4.7 percent, which is actually below the average level from the past 40 annual rate in the second half of last Committee's target inflation rate of 2 percent in the second half know, a relatively noisy indicator, but it's still an indicator. returned to near-normal presumably costs to increasing that capacity that existing capacity. 2 percent target.  Indeed, my own outlook, like President George's, is that our accommodative

I'm less than she is that inflation will stabilize at that level, because that depends on policy choices to make that happen. policy will lead average sanguine choices, and we would have to make also suggest that the relevant discrepancy could be large.  From an Okun's law than six months.  If output gap to the fraction of those people who have been unemployed conclusion that it was near zero or even positive. These data suggest that the output gap could be less negative than is estimated in the Tealbook.  They perspective, the Tealbook's measure of the output gap is well calibrated to the fraction of people who are unemployed, including those who have been unemployed for more we instead calibrated the for less than six months, we would reach the

accommodation and are able to generate an increase in aggregate demand. firms could meet that new demand.  The first approach would out of the labor force.  And this approach would have little inflationary pressures.  The firms for their workers or to look for recently workers.  This approach would drive up wages and lead to inflationary pressures, effect on the long-term unemployment rate.  To the extent that true output gap is in The problem is that even relatively small upward effects on policy.  Suppose, that the output gap is better approximated by minus 4 percent, as opposed to the getting, as reported by President Williams-the minus 4 percent number. So we could think about this issue intuitively as follows.  Suppose we continue with our extraordinary level of Crudely, there are two ways that be to turn to hiring workers who have been unemployed for more than six months or who are currently second approach would be to compete with other unemployed but it would have relatively little firms meet new demand by using this second strategy, I would say that the fact lower than the Tealbook's estimate. adjustments to the Tealbook estimate of the output gap can have big for example, Tealbook estimate of minus 5.3 percent.  That's the same as the estimate that the San Francisco Fed apparently is

I think this is a very important 5 or 10 years from now to pursue the dual mandate and not don't see us as having a way to commit future FOMCs to follow what would be unduly It follows that I don't see nominal income targeting as being Once we realize that commitment isn't possible, I would say that the graphs in et al. memo imply that the Taylor (1999) rule provides a reasonable approximation to extreme assumption of treating FRB/US as literally good approximation. So, at this point, I've mentioned Taylor we should be using that as some kind of benchmark may seem to miss the message of the very thoughtful memo we providing more point.  I just don't see how we are supposed to force future policymakers to do what is in our interest as opposed to theirs.  Indeed, such a commitment is really a violation on the part of those future policymakers of the consensus framework statement that we issued at the last meeting. That statement requires policymakers tolerate high rates of inflation just to keep some promises made by their predecessors operating today.  I easy policy from their perspective. a viable strategy. the Tealbook B, which I liked quite a bit-I like the comparisons they offer-and the results of the Erceg what we should be doing, even if we take the true, as opposed to only itself providing a

(1999) rule to use in the absence of commitment.  I see reasons for suspecting So, to sum up, I don't think commitment is possible, and given that, I think Taylor seems like a reasonable that the Tealbook estimate of the output gap is too negative.  Using a Taylor rule with an output gap of, say, minus 4 percent, it would be hard to see a justification for increasing our level of

YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with the view expressed around the table that we're seeing range of the establishment and household surveys, and job gains appear to be widespread across industries.  Unemployment insurance claims are down, the hourly workweek has returned to precrisis levels, and households are telling pollsters that the employment situation is rosier.  For example, the highest proportion of consumers in the history of the Michigan survey spontaneously consumers expect declines in the jobless rate than at any time since 2004. Employment Index-another measure of workers' perceptions of the labor 7 points in February to its highest level since September 2008.  And now that layoffs have abated, chief financial officers polled in a long-running survey by that employee morale, Notwithstanding these improvements in the employment picture, before labor market conditions could be described as normal.  For example, the quit rate, a reflection of workers' willingness and ability to change jobs, while up from the trough reached in January 2010, is still nowhere near its pre-recession level.  The pace of hiring has improved, but only slightly, and the duration of unemployment spells remains exceptionally long.

For example, even at first quarter of 2012, about 35 percent of firms listed it among their top But 35 percent remains a far cry from the 62 percent that ranked their inability to of Lehman. One indicator of the degree of labor market slack is the frequency with which firms report that their ability to attract and retain qualified workers is among their top business concerns.  Of course, many of our Reserve Bank directors and other business contacts routinely cite such concerns because certain skills are chronically in short supply. the end of 2009, with unemployment hovering near 10 percent, around 25 percent of firms ranked attracting and retaining workers among their top three business concerns.  That fraction has picked up.

about general credit amazing stories about housing. MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'll start by talking briefly conditions, and then I'll move on to some pretty but not spectacular.  Unused commitments for C&amp;I loans are and represent potential additional funding that is roughly equal to current balances down from their highs, they are still pretty healthy with pre-crisis levels.  Most of the growth is in loans to larger companies, and small flat, and construction loan portfolios remain in I've been saying for banks lowering standards to get volume because all have been burned C&amp;I loan growth is steady also growing outstanding.  However, it's important to remember that C&amp;I represents only about one-fourth of bank core loan portfolios.  And even though every banker talks about the level of competition, while spreads on new loans have come compared business lending is pretty flat.  Commercial real estate loans continue to decline gradually, as loans for existing structures are relatively liquidation mode.  Although total consumer credit is increasing, it must be doing so in nonbank portfolios, as balances on bank books declined in January and February.  As a while now, with the exception of mortgages, I don't believe credit availability will hinder the recovery at all, nor do I believe that we have to worry about lending running too hot-demand is just too weak-or about by credit problems this cycle, and they will be slow to forget.

of my comments on housing and, in particular, on the overhang calls, community bankers had of these anecdotes, I noted that nationally, the that some markets calls this time, I heard the same kinds of stories about tight supply from GSEs announced a pilot block purchases of OREO properties.  In fact, a $40 million package of residential real estate to a single has I had to confirm its reasonableness with President Lockhart Sure enough, Latin American buyers and rental conversions have this is happening in Phoenix, with Canadians playing the role of the Latin I'd like to focus the rest of inventory that's holding down house prices.  In my last round of some pretty surprising stories about excess inventory of lots and houses that had been marked down substantially in some markets.  In support inventory of existing homes came down to six months of sales, which meant were down in the two-to-three-month range, a level that usually indicates a seller's market. When I made my regional and national mortgage lenders, leading me to believe that the inventory overhang we've been so worried about might have finally disappeared in a lot of markets, and that the prospects of even tighter supply are on the horizon.  A few weeks ago, the program soliciting investor interest in blocks of single-family homes located in several markets where supply is the largest.  And in a sign that such sales might be successful, at least one large bank told me of strong interest from investors for the bank had just closed the sale of investor.  Indeed, even in the Miami condo market, a poster child for overbuilding, inventory reportedly come down from 24,000 units to 2,300 units, a level in line with historical norms.  I found this report so unbelievable that before I dared repeat it. soaked up the excess inventory.  And according to an article in the Wall Street Journal morning, the same thing Americans.

March 13, 2012

say the buyers are making bids on numerous properties before recovery, we might see a sharper a cork-out-of-the-bottle effect, as frictions in supply and demand make price with existing inventory.  Several of the biggest loan servicers told me that their mortgage lenders across the country are repeatedly reporting borrowers with preapproved credit who cannot find homes to buy.  The lenders they're successful.  So I'm beginning to think it's possible that when prices do turn around-and I'm not sure when that might happen-rather than a gradual turnaround, sort of adjustments somewhat jerky in individual markets and as local markets recover at different rates.

I think that.  First, prices seem to have really overshot the mark, if you look existing to construct a similar home.  And the absolute prices seem really low If prices in Las Vegas fall the 10 percent that they're projected to fall this Here's why at measures of affordability, the cost of rental versus ownership, and the price of an home relative to the cost now.  Consider this: year, the median home price will be under $100,000.

homeowners not under water, but don't need to sell, may worth.  And builders inventory until prices recover to a level that covers construction costs. Third, it's going to be difficult to coax out additional supply.  Underwater may not be in a position to sell, and those who are hold out for higher prices that meet their expectation of what their house is won't provide additional for bargains and focus on the house they really want.

you, Mr. Chairman.  Like many of you, I'm going to address you have already discussed, couple of months.  So side, we've had three consecutive months of good net job creation numbers.  First-time unemployment claims are down.  We've had a rate during that period.  As Narayana noted, employment is up, though the experience of a couple of at least raises the question as to whether this is still a harbinger of future permanent MR. TARULLO.  Thank principally the labor market, both for its intrinsic importance and because of the window it provides on economic trends more generally.  And again, as many of there has been a mixed picture, although mixed on the upside, over the last just to rehearse quickly the mix, on the favorable pretty 0.4 percentage point decline in the unemployment average hours worked seem to be normalizing to pre-crisis levels-and even somewhat higher, actually, in manufacturing.  Temporary years ago hiring.

side, the first point is the one that, I think, John made earlier-that way to go before even pre-crisis job levels are reached.  As several of you economic growth picks up quite a bit, it's hard to see how the recent job It is the case that both job openings and quits are up, but that ways to go.  And while government employment losses have been declining recently, the municipal level.

March 13, 2012

years after two or three months of good numbers, the case is far from a clear one.  And I think indicates some broader questions about labor markets.  Again, a number of you would first note that this is not just an artifact of the recent crisis. The two recent recessions-as, I think, Bill Wascher noted-were atypical in any circumstances, but they're probably referred to one of the big questions that is looming out suggested that the recent developments are the obverse of the cleared as we see the opposite phenomenon, It also means that potential output has probably been overstated gap. of this probably have referred to those.  I There's been some question for at least a decade now as to whether the operation of U.S. labor markets has been changing in some ways.  Dynamism seems to have declined well before the financial crisis. their own patterns-actually, unemployment did not rise quickly during those recessions, but it then came down even more slowly thereafter.  The crisis and the ensuing recession that we've just experienced are, we hope, anomalous under masking some longer-term trends as well.  The Okun's law dilemma that the staff has and addressed in the current Tealbook is obviously there.  The staff has now phenomenon that we saw in 2009, when unemployment increases outstripped even the substantial levels that Okun's law would have predicted given what was happening with GDP.  If the staff is right, then the accounts are now being and job creation henceforth would return closer to the historical relationship that one would expect from Okun's law. somewhat, which in turn calls into question the size of the current output as the economy continues to recover?  I'm afraid that the answer to this fact that the participation rate has declined faster since A second important ongoing question is, what will happen to the labor participation rate of the civilian workforce question is bad news one way or the other, though how it is bad news matters for our policies. The question is prompted in part by the the recession began than would have been predicted based on the secular downward trend and

March 13, 2012

given the extension of UI programs.  This development improvement in the unemployment rate, although not so much the If participation returns to trend-that is, if workers are drawn back into the as conditions improve-then the drop in the unemployment rate will be slowed.  If, never entered it, presumably because of some younger people getting demographic changes, particularly accounts for some of the recent improvement. labor market on the other hand, the participation rate does not return to the somewhat slower pre-recession downward trend, then the productive potential of the economy will have been harmed since more people will have dropped out of the labor force or combination of discouragement, atrophied skills, increased difficulties of a first job, and the availability of disability and early retirement programs.

themselves noted, their provisional solution to the Okun's law example, that the volatility of GDP data turns for an even longer time.  But I think it's a major role in the kind of structural damage that's experienced.  And Bill Dudley's account of the research on construction workers an inadequate amount of stimulus to get things moving and thus to stop some of the phenomena that I mentioned a few moments ago.  If circumstances would only worsen the To what degree is the structural As staff members conundrum may not be correct if it turns out, for out to require less shoving of the known square facts into a round theoretical hole.  And the participation rate question may be hard to answer increasingly likely that there has been some medium-term structural damage to the labor market and thus to growth potential-not as dramatic, perhaps, as the Tealbook's alternative scenario of a 'Lost Decade,' but with some of the same underlying dynamic.  Now, it's important to note that mismatch does not look to be playing being underscores that point.  If there is indeed a structural problem, it is one borne of a very slow cyclical recovery in which there was more quickly that's the case, then removing accommodation under these problem.  And this is going to be the policy judgment for us:

And again, to date there's not really slack is still there, and that we Finally, on wage pressures, it is absolutely the case that unit labor costs are up, although, as Narayana said, that is a noisy data series.  I keep asking, pressing, torturing the staff to see if there are indications of wage pressures-labor market income pressures more generally-or if we can very much evidence of that, so that, again, suggests to me that the still do have a ways to go.

I think, to conclude, we may have to untether ourselves for a while from more models because there is something going on longer term in the labor I said, being masked or amplified by the recent unusual going to be hard to separate those things, so we're probably going to have to feel for a while.

labor market has also to persist for quite a economy primarily characterized by a growth seems poor.  Wage income rose MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, was encouraged to see GDP growth move up above 3 percent in the fourth quarter, and the news from the looked more positive.  That said, over all of 2011, GDP rose just 1½ percent, a pace that would be mediocre anytime and is especially so during what is supposed to be a recovery.  If the pace of activity doesn't pick up, the high level of the unemployment rate is likely long time.  To me, it seems that we're still dealing with an lack of aggregate demand, and the prognosis for faster

The BLS provides a employment based on the household survey, which is corrected to approximate the in the payroll survey and which is corrected for the change in the population The progress in the labor market, as others have noted, has also including not just payrolls and the unemployment rate, but a variety of other indicators, such as temporary hiring, jobless claims, and diffusion indexes, are all pointing toward a stronger and more sustainable improvement in the labor market.  Public-sector job losses seem to be stopping, and they were a major negative over the last alternative measures of labor input.  I thought it somewhat different pictures.  On the one hand, we can compare the payroll survey with comparable series for same categories as

you probably are aware, household significantly more than payroll employment-2.7 million jobs by this metric the last two months by this metric. with 1.2 million over the last six months in the establishment survey.  So there household survey.  The staff tells me to ignore this-it's entirely you want to look at the half-empty side, it could suggest further than some other indicators have suggested. controls.  Between December and January, interestingly, as employment rose over the last six months and 1.4 million, incredibly, over That's compared is a stronger trend in the noise-which it may be.  On the other hand, it could be indicative of somewhat stronger underlying conditions.  Or, I suppose, if that the payroll growth is not sufficient to sustain the unemployment rate.  The unemployment rate has progressed that I find useful and that has been used a lot in the hours, but total hours worked, because that and part-time work and the like.  As I higher than anything we saw in the more recent recession, but on an hourspeak-to-trough decline in 1981-82 was 5.8 percent.  Here, in this decline in labor input.  It took one year for the years since the that you get from the unemployment what Another measure of labor input literature is aggregate hours worked-not weekly combines not just the number of jobs, but also workweeks indicated in an earlier meeting, by this metric, this recession was far worse than the 1981-82 recession.  From an unemployment metric, the peak unemployment rate in 1981-82 of 10.8 percent was worked basis, the worst episode, it was 9.4 percent-a remarkably larger labor hours decline in 1981-82 to return back to the peak.  We've been two trough and we're still 4.1 percent below the peak, and that doesn't include, of course, any trend. So the hours metric, at least, does suggest the same point rate, which is that there's been improvement, certainly, but we're still pretty far below would be considered a normal situation in the labor market.

commented on what we can call the Okun's law puzzle, the GDP growth and the decline in unemployment.  As has pointed out, this has even been picked up by the press, with some pretty good research in a President Williams noted the factor model summary that showed that the news very positive from an is a very important puzzle and an interesting and we have essentially returned to the going to go. Almost everyone has contradiction between the slow rate of been couple of cases. flow since the last meeting for the first half of 2012 was actually quite negative in terms of revisions when he looked at it from a spending and demand side, but it was employment and production side.  So there really contradiction there.  Of course, the problem is that if we don't see further economic growth, and if in fact it is the case that the staff's analysis is correct Okun's law line, it's possible that the recent burst of employment growth will slow going forward.  And then in that case, we would see that very little unemployment improvement except for that related to the expiration of the extraordinary unemployment benefits.  So it's not clear which way that's

For example, looking at consumer spending, last time of the underlying determinants of consumer spending and noted that measured income and wealth have been quite flat. since our last meeting, but even so, real disposable income about 1 percent in the second half of last whole.  Wages have better indicators of factors, very slow.  And indeed, the ECI shows that nominal wages and salaries, excluding

And wealth-to-income ratios are about where they were you put this all together, notwithstanding some positive signs, yet seen really clear evidence that demand is I think we still have a this recent improvement will peter out.  President Plosser, I think, asked see more-definitive evidence that only 1.6 percent variable-weight, rather than a fixed-weight, indicator.  So that suggests that gains we're seeing in average hourly related to the underlying early in the recovery.  So if including retail sales this morning, we just haven't going to pick up and be consistent with faster GDP growth, and therefore nonnegligible risk that when the tipping point was.  My tipping point will be when we consumer spending and other components of final demand are strengthening above the trend level.  I think that would be an important milestone.

I won't talk about the other components of final the so-called fiscal cliff on January 1, 2013. uncertainty as the lame-duck Congress wrestles with some kind of solution to the good thing because it may force longer-term fiscal consolidation, I put that as a risk that we should I demand.  I've noted in various testimonies recently That's going to lead either to a very sharp tightening in fiscal policy or, at a minimum, a period of considerable problem.  Now, it may be a which would be, obviously, of benefit in the longer term, but be looking at.

I'm encouraged.  Sentiment seems better, but there are important uncertainties remaining, including, notably, differences in of Okun's law, the basic

March 13, 2012

going forward, and uncertainties about fiscal policy.  So I think we need a clearer confidence that we have finally turned the proverbial corner. more quickly fix on these things before we have yet.  In the most recent three-month reading that so far, the gas commodity price I've taken a look at some various commodity price indexes.  Let me report briefly on There's a very substantial contrast between and what happened at the beginning of 2011.  In a 24 percent increase in the second half of 2010.  So there was a large This time, about 3 percent since the beginning of the year, and it remains gas and not part of a broad-based I would tend to attribute a lot of that to risk premiums, expected economic growth or monetary we're going to have close to a 2 percent Just a word on inflation.  A lot has been said about this.  As was noted, the increases in oil prices had not shown up in the official statistics of PCE inflation, core was still higher than headline, which meant, obviously, prices hadn't shown up.  So instead, in order to assess the importance of increases, the CRB spot price index, which is a daily index that includes 22 non-energy commoditiesmetals and agricultural commodities primarily. what's happened recently in commodity prices the beginning of 2011, this CRB non-energy index rose about 12 percent until the peak in April, and that came on top of and sustained increase in commodity prices, even outside of energy prices, last year. that index has risen only 14 percent below the peak of last April.  I take this as an indication that in this case, the oil price moves are a little bit more unique, in some sense.  They're commodity price increase, and therefore supply concerns, and geopolitical risks rather than to policy.  So I think that bodes well for inflation going forward, but obviously, to continue to monitor those commodity price developments.  Inflation expectations remain well anchored, and-as was discussed earlier-the term structure of inflation expectations does show some near-term increase, but beyond the near term, we appear to be very expectation as based on financial market indicators.  Questions?

March 13, 2012

I'm reminded that I, in my own comments, put a lot of weight on the staff's estimate of the some very interesting and provocative the Board staff has distinctions between the unemployment rate of those unemployed your gap analysis. MR. EVANS.  Mr. Chairman, after that very careful discussion about the labor market data, output gap.  President Kocherlakota presented observations on different measures of the unemployment rate.  I wonder if any thoughts about those longer than six months and under six months, and what that might portend for it is whether short-term unemployment you focused on and the In our own analysis, because we don't find much difference between the effects on gap as MR. WASCHER.  I think one way to think about or longer-term unemployment have different effects on inflation.  When we look at the evidence on that, we don't find much difference in the effects on inflation between longer-term unemployment and short-term unemployment.  President Kocherlakota's story, if just under six months, would be consistent with an increase in structural unemployment NAIRU. inflation of those different groups, we tend to focus more on the published unemployment our measure of slack than on, say, the short-term unemployment gap.

you look at the MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I think it would be fair to say, though, that if historical evidence, it's hard to find periods where we've seen such sharp differences in the behavior of those two series.

Tarullo's point, I think, is well taken-that we could be seeing some yet in the I would not rule that out. MR. WASCHER.  I agree with that.  The long-term unemployment rate is really high right now, and Governor sort of labor market damage resulting from that.  We don't see much evidence of that data, but

MR. EVANS.  So in terms of movement in and out of short-term versus long-term unemployment, do you see unusual behavior there?  Are they truly out of line?

March 13, 2012

that long-term come down a bunch, and they're at really low MR. WASCHER.  Well, I think they're out of line in the sense unemployment is still really high.  Layoffs have levels at this point, but we're not seeing the hiring yet that one would need to see to bring down unemployment across the duration.

guess the question is whether or not entry and exit rates into those pools differ.  It could be that they would more quickly adjust in the short term. MR. EVANS.  I would necessarily you're referring to, and one might were a structural problem, that the exit rate would be depressed.  That groups.  That was true in the intense phase of the groups and not for others. MR. KILEY.  We tracked the data on exit rates that imagine, if people who were unemployed for a long time were having trouble exiting from unemployment and there exit rate is depressed, and it's depressed for all recession, and it's still true.  We haven't seen a recovery for some

KOCHERLAKOTA.  I'll just say one word about that.  I think those important observations to keep in mind, and it's useful to bring them forward.  That said, one thing that's hard to get a from long-term unemployment are to monetary policy, as opposed to exit unemployment, because have in the one

Mr. Chairman, you spoke about other components of spending if decline in the unemployment rate.

pretty close to where we were in 2006 and extrapolate out from this as the norm we're returning to, and those who think that we expect growth this table-those who view the trend line that lies 2007 and suffered a one-time downward level shock of some sort and that we ought to only at trend rates from here.

Implicit in my statement, which was the notion that if in fact economic growth stays at 2 percent, we will going forward other than that attributable to the with my model and we'll have to look at that. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That's a an ad hoc statement, was not see much improvement in unemployment end of extraordinary unemployment insurance benefits.  If that turns out to be empirically wrong-that is, if we continue to have slow growth and declining unemployment-then obviously, there's something wrong gotten now to item 3, 'Current Monetary Policy.'

Alternative B updates the Committee's views regarding the only a temporary strains in global financial markets appear to have eased somewhat, they may to see significant downside risks to the economic financial problems in Europe.  Thus, Committee members may view the economy as progressing along a trajectory that is broadly similar to the one seen in January, with downside risks to that trajectory still predominating, and so they could choose a statement like that under about economic conditions to reflect the incoming data, but does not alter the 'at least through late 2014' wording in the forward guidance or the language balance sheet.

considerations might lead it to keep the 'late 2014' guidance.  At the time of date of liftoff may continue to see 'at least through late 2014' as of the past two springs, some policymakers change guidance.  Because the Committee moved the forward guidance date particularly appropriate if the changes in the date out of concern that such a clearer link to changes in the Committee's Committee can provide greater clarity postmeeting statement, the SEP, or by other means. Even if the Committee sees a more-than-modest improvement in the outlook, several the January meeting, a number of members thought that the appropriate was well into 2015 or in 2016, and even with a somewhat brighter outlook for growth, these members appropriate.  And, with the 'false dawns' may be skeptical of the extent of the improvement in the outlook and so prefer to wait for additional information on economic activity and inflation before making a in the forward out to 'late 2014' only seven weeks ago, it may be reluctant to fine-tune that date so soon.  Keeping the current language might seem Committee wants to avoid frequent changes would be confusing to the public and could undermine confidence in the Committee unless supported by economic outlook.  Indeed, some members may prefer to wait to change the liftoff date in the forward guidance until the regarding that link in the the economy has been expanding 'moderately,' but about the labor market to say that conditions 'have improved and that the unemployment rate has 'declined notably in recent months' The statement also upgrades the 'subdued in recent recent increase in the prices of crude oil and gasoline.

We talked a lot here in coming up with its own guide to formulating good But I do think it's important in the current situation that such simple LSAPs and the zero lower bound. LSAP program may suggest a higher funds rate path than a I say 'may' here because I agree with the Ed Nelson and John Roberts that an LSAP adjustment is not as straightforward as, Indeed, I would like to see further greater clarity in how to best adjust a simple rule for LSAPs.  Second, and I think much more important, these simple policy rules ignore Gauti Eggertsson and Mike Woodford, Dave Reifschneider rules and how they should be gains of the optimal regarding the about simple policy rules, and the Tealbook talked about simple rules interest rate forecast.  And prescriptions from simple rules can be a useful monetary policy.  I particularly like the outcome-based and the Taylor 1999 rules as examples of simple rules. rules, taken on their own, ignore two important issues:  the LSAPs provide significant monetary stimulus, which can substitute for some conventional monetary accommodation.  So the simple funds rate rule would recommend otherwise. fine memo by and is likely smaller than, the simple correction usually made. work along these lines, and it may provide the effects of the zero lower bound.  Research by and myself, and many others have looked at monetary policy modified in the context of the zero lower bound.  And the results show consistently that it's optimal to deviate from the usual simple policy rule and keep the funds rate lower than otherwise for a longer period of time.  Such deviations capture some of the commitment policy or the nominal GDP targeting policy described in the other memo.

simple rules in the Tealbook, I'm comfortable with a guidance.  That said, the hurdle for making changes to the from meeting to meeting should not be high.  So I'm taking a different position than that the projected policy liftoff This is largely why, relative to the late 2014 liftoff in our current policy liftoff date Bill outlined in his presentation.  We have conveyed to the public

Core inflation seems quite close to going to hover estimate of the time period at which it's most likely said at the last meeting, it was in the latter half of characterize where I am the recommendation of President that at every meeting, with interest rate setting.  In particular, it's useful to really think policy-setting displayed away from the zero In thinking about the statement, I want to buttress Williams.  I think it's useful to compare forward guidance language, and how we think about setting about this well-documented characteristic that our bound, which is interest rate smoothing.  This is the idea that our interest rate changes tend to be

March 13, 2012

the next meeting cutting them, or cutting rates and an obvious advantage to us in that if we given interest rate change conveys much more information yield curve.  The yield curve moves more, because a given interest rate change In contrast, you meeting ignoring the current setting for the funds rate and, with a blank on our optimal rate-deciding anew, as if we had no history before us of get fed funds rate changes that were more frequent and is something we've done for a long time-it's been well documented. make is that this represents a form of commitment in the sense that we If we've cut interest rates, we're not at the next meeting.  We're going to wait a few meetings to see a trend and in a sequence in the same direction, they tend to be persistent, and they're seldom reversed.  So we strive to avoid raising rates and then at then at the next meeting raising them.  Now, this has behave that way over time, then any relevant to the conveys much more information about future settings of the short-term rate. could picture us at every sheet of paper, deciding what we've said.  And we'd likely variable, but they would carry much less information about future funds rate changes.  So this property of interest rates Now, the point I want to set interest rates taking into account what we did before. going to reverse them then reverse them if we're going to do that.

I was considering my decision at this meeting. I was thinking, all right, in the usual interest rate setting, if you dissent against a cut in the you might not want to dissent in favor of raising rates again to undo previous meeting.  And a good rationale for that would be cut interest rates, they have the effect that's consistent with this.  So that suggests really not a commitment.  I think the Chairman has been really clear that it's not a Now, I started thinking about this because And funds rate, the next meeting the cut that the Committee voted at the to maintain the commitment of the Committee to smoothing interest rates so that in the future, when we do something about this meeting, but first, let's think about forward guidance.  We've been clear that it's

March 13, 2012

Vice Chairman, and I'm your views are compatible with what the Chairman has said commitment, but instead representing a forecast.  But if we go go holding up changes in forward guidance, not bringing going to be, going to make it look like a commitment.  It's going to potentially confuse an inertia to the forward guidance language that makes it more I don't think this is a curiosity. If we keep it frozen at one date, compared with the fluctuate on a six- or eight-week basis, it's going to look like a promise now and then, and that'll be a mistake.  I say this, and as you know, I going to have to wrestle with, having gone down this path.  And putting forward guidance communication we change only commitment.  Now, I heard something slightly different from the interested in understanding whether about this not representing a smoothing forward guidance, if we forward the date because we just increased it at the last meeting, over time there's meeting to meeting, a little gap opening up between what we really think and what's in the statement, and that's the public.  It's going to give commitment-like and less like truly our forecast at that meeting. I think that this is relevant to policy-setting. extent to which forecasts that we change only every argued against actually including this forward guidance at the last meeting, and this is one of the pitfalls that I think we're it in the SEP, of course, would have made it a every two meetings rather than one meeting-and so, to some extent, would obviate some of this issue.

I vote at this meeting, I don't see a value for smoothing forward guidance.  So I think economic conditions are going to with going to dissent on that.  I have a couple of editing suggestions for the statement. As for how to my mind, the logical way for me to vote is whether warrant exceptionally low interest rates through the date in the statement, and I don't agree that.  So I'm I'll just read them.

This is the last sentence in paragraph 2.  Why don't we just say '2 percent'?  Or we then at the next meeting, delete the circumlocution.  And then there's a paragraph 3.  The statement says 'help ensure that inflation, say 'is at Internet to find At the last meeting, we officially adopted an inflation objective of 2 percent, and yet in our most consistent with its We're talking about, ' . . . the Committee anticipates that subsequently inflation will run at or below . . .

Yes, and so that might outweigh my meeting. January, represents something of a make commitments.

For now, we should determine whether our forecast of improvement in the economic MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

As I mentioned in the last go-round, recent declines in the unemployment rate and strengthening employment indicate that

March 13, 2012

year might, in fact, be too pessimistic.  Taking both of those factors into the end of the consideration leads me to believe that it will be appropriate to start policy tightening well before late 2014.

guidance language we adopted at our last meeting appears with an opportunity to introduce more state-contingent language in the and I'll elaborate more on that in that meeting.  But for the moment, let me I'd strongly prefer moving away from calendar dates in our communication and clarify the conditional nature of our policy decisions.  My views on this are great deal of work on that-so has Andy Levin and others-and they've been influential Schmitt-Grohé and Martin Uribe, I've been studying this literature on simple, robust rules because I both about the parameters of a particular model which of the many existing macro models provide good approximations to the in measuring many of the variables that we Some key points that I take away from this literature are that simple, robust rules host of models, and that adhering to these types of rules rather than the generally generate generally work well respond fairly aggressively to In my view, the forward increasingly misguided.  However, the discussion on policy communications we'll have later in the meeting provides us policy statement, indicate that toward ways that informed by the literature on simple and robust rules, as President Williams has stressed.  He's done a in my thinking.  I would also mention the work of Stephanie working within the confines of macromodels such as those developed by President Evans and his coauthors.  In particular, believe there exists substantial model uncertainty and about economy.  There also exists substantial uncertainty react to-in particular, as has been discussed today, various measures of slack or resource utilization. generally work well in a rules generated from a particular model's optimized behavior does not significant welfare losses.  The rules that deviations of inflation from target and less aggressively to measures of real activity.  They're

March 13, 2012

gaps altogether.  Indeed, it appears that actual FOMC behavior has consistent with the prescriptions of many of these robust rules.  Yet our aid the public in better guides policy, I'm in favor of providing more fairly general way, about the variables that are our primary also fairly inertial, as we've been pointing out.  Further, the measurement problems associated with gap-type variables point to an attenuation in the desired response to gaps and, in some cases, to avoiding the use of been broadly communications do not articulate this systematic behavior.  To understanding the systematic framework that information, although probably in a determinants of policy, and I'll elaborate on this later.

robustness.  Another important lesson robust rules is that rules optimized for a particular model may produce we face, we staff's memo on simple rules seems to have overlooked this important message.  For you look at figure 5 in that memo, you can see that the simple rules produce interest FRB/US and eye, they are very reasonable.  However, when models or the models under FRB/US is notably different from a policymaker who believes he's in a I'm skeptical of relying too heavily on the sorules that we get from the FRB/US model when we see the Tealbook each the exercise presented in the memo that indicates the improvements An important emphasis in this literature concerns that's learned from these highly undesirable outcomes in another model.  Given the tremendous uncertainty should strive to operate in a manner that works well across many theoretical depictions of reality. The Board example, if rate paths and paths for unemployment and inflation that are fairly similar across SIGMA.  Although not exactly optimal, to my one looks at the interest rate paths that are optimal for these two commitment, they seem to be very different.  Thus, what an optimizing policymaker does in a world that resembles world of SIGMA.  I would conjecture that optimized rules for one model do not perform very well in the other model.  This is one of the reasons called optimal policy meeting.  Consequently,

March 13, 2012

costs to relying on simple rules.  Instead, I remain disposed toward using simple, robust guiding policies. from following optimal policies or commitment policies does not persuade me that there are huge rules for way with these rules, but as he noted, when we get to the zero lower going to be much and why we're changing at the zero lower going to act in normal times.  And so as a behaving with simple a from it.  And I'll talk more about As President Williams pointed out, I think it's important that we talk about conducting policy in a systematic bound, things change.  And that's important for us to understand.  But it's easier from my perspective to communicate how bound when we've been able to articulate how we're communication device, this becomes very important-for us to talk about rules in one framework, and then when we feel as though it's important to deviate, we have way of talking about that deviation when you move away communications later on.

the language in alternative C is most consistent with my views paragraph 1.  I argued last time that with the enhancement of the SEP, calendar date from forward guidance, because I'm systematic policy is a better form of forward guidance than trying to use these commitment strategies.  I members of the Committee are prepared to dates, even though the staff forecast suggests we need to change them is one of the problems, I think, with the calendar date language.  One could I believe moving the date around from one meeting to the next Of the policy alternatives, of the economy-that is, we should take the opportunity to remove the uncomfortable with forward guidance.  I think that actually specifying our rules continue to believe that the language is undesirable, and it's led to more confusion than clarity. While, unfortunately, I don't believe most of the eliminate these calendar yet again, this consider shifting the date, but would tend to undermine the credibility of the Committee and our intended policy.  I believe we

March 13, 2012

rules to the public.  With that in mind, I prefer the general direction-but I also believe that C offers a better and should drop this altogether, and would strongly prefer that we move to more state-contingent guidance that describes our policy direction of alternative C-the general more accurate description of the economy.

alternative B, I suspect that that's going to be preferred, so let me make a actually align with President Lacker's comments previously.  I would describe housing as having rather than 'improved somewhat.'  I found Governor Duke's comments about paragraph 2, I would do similar to what President Lacker that we were committed to our statutory mandate, not a dual That's just redundant at this point.  I would also, on the next sentence that has to do gradually toward levels that the I agree with President also agree with President Lacker that the last sentence seems contorted.  We should just 2 percent objective.' With respect to couple of suggestions.  They would prefer to substitute paragraph 1 from C, although I 'stabilized' housing quite encouraging.  In suggested.  I would remove the first sentence of paragraph 2.  I think it adds nothing.  Our consensus statement made clear mandate. with employment-'the unemployment rate will decline Committee judges to be consistent with its mandate'-leave 'dual' out. Lacker-things have improved in Europe, so I would tend to omit the word 'significant.'  And finally, I say, 'The Committee anticipates that inflation will converge toward its Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

So at this juncture is that the risks, so to speak, around the path to policy are tilted to an rather than later tightening.  And in the minds of the public and market participants, the the Committee is providing for liftoff in I were to be consistent with my forecast, I would date just one meeting after adopting 'late 2014.'  By focusing the concerned we are conveying much more certainty in forecast precision than I very much, like others, look forward to the upcoming discussion of Others have not won't, either.

Anticipating the upcoming discussion on policy communication, I, like others, am concerned that the date device will become increasingly problematic were the Committee to adopt the practice of moving it back and forth or to and fro with the evolution of the economic outlook.  Both the Tealbook and my updated forecast for this meeting have the start date of tightening considerably earlier in 2014.  So if lean to support an earlier public on a date, I'm is warranted.  So communications options.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I see the opinions will not be altered with just a few months or quarters of better data.  Indeed, just to get the modest pickup in GDP

I noted earlier, these forecasts leave us falling far short going to have to see much better data.  As on our mandate.

I were preparing for the Leadership Conference that we have in Chicago a couple of times a year, and on the topic central bank for the United States, the Federal enormous assets:  One, we print money, one way or another, to achieve our dual I listen to Fed's independence, I don't always get the point that I think about it.  Paul Volcker in 1979 used the On the merits of the I believe these were the correct actions in 1979 and 1982.  They allows the Fed to do meritorious actions even when they are deeply unpopular.  And here's Now, earlier last week, Charlie Plosser, Esther George, and Senior we were talking about, it got me thinking.  As the Reserve has two mandate objectives; and, two, we're an independent central bank.  Sometimes when arguments around this table related to the the speaker seems to have in mind.  Here's how Fed's independence to make tough decisions for the U.S. economy that were clearly unpopularallow the federal funds rate to rise to 18 percent for a time, restrict credit, and break the back of runaway inflation while letting unemployment rise above 10 percent. analysis for the U.S. economy, were exceedingly brave actions.  For me, independence of monetary policy the right thing and take the thing:  These unpopular actions can go in either direction-for less accommodation or for more accommodation.  Fed independence is not just a synonym for higher interest rates.

Suppose you go out and review the policy conclusions based and, two, do a reasonable job in good grounding, I don't know what world they're telling us about.  These analyses routinely accommodation can improve our economy and reduce our dual good memos.  I can't ignore these lessons.  If others I'd like to see evidence based on empirically credible general-equilibrium models with embedded.  I'd like to see it-haven't seen it myself. Now, every credible macroeconomic analysis and Williams, Reifschneider, et al. are different people.  Let me on models that have, one, general-equilibrium underpinnings their empirical characterization of the macroeconomy.  After all, if they don't have a empirical state that further monetary mandate misses.  The Board staff memos and Tealbook B policy analyses are examples that are very clear on this.  I thought those were very disagree, those alternative policies accommodation than recommended in B, and without any consensus on stronger forward guidance-let's just wait for the alternative A.  After all, President Kocherlakota and others good point that commitment is very hard to do for a central banker who cares about going to take it If we can't commit to it with a low interest we should do larger-scale asset would make it very difficult to unwind very quickly.

These are empirical models. MR. BULLARD.  Why isn't there a simulation that says, okay, 3 percent inflation or better?  I don't see one.

for the Committee's I suggest removing the 'late 2014' date and replacing it with the last sentence of alternative B, but we move in the language from policy content.  I think this would improve the I also agree with President Lacker's suggestions for the statement, I think better reflect the Committee intent and the current situation.  So, as a reminder, he Okay.  I counsel patience at this meeting.  I think we should adopt a wait-and-see stance. I do think the 'late 2014' language causes problems for this Committee because of the unwillingness to change the date with changes in the forecast.  This tends to create inconsistency between market expectations and the statement over time.  This is unhealthy credibility. paragraph 3 in alternative C.  So we just take alternative C or similar language.  This would remove the need to be moving the date around at each meeting, but otherwise would not change the credibility of the Committee. which

March 13, 2012

'2 percent' instead of a bunch of words.  Get rid of the 'dual' and just say I'd be open to what people think about 'significant.'  The tensions in Europe I'd be interested to hear what others have to say about whether we should out or not.  I think if we leave it in there, you're saying that nothing has gone away completely.  I'd be open to how others I would lean toward taking 'significant' out as a way to signal that the said, just say 'mandate.'  And have been reduced, but take 'significant' improved.  That's always a delicate thing for the Committee here to accurately reflect changes in the situation without saying the tail risks have want to do that, but Committee understands that the situation in Europe has changed somewhat.

Taking all of those into I would recommend changing are a couple.

The first was the way-on the broader advantage of Minnesota; account, the only things sector remains depressed' is a little bit harsh. just say, 'Indicators of to when housing prices will stabilize.'

As to Lacker's comments, I think we should, at the very end of that sentence-I wouldn't as to our long-term strategy, why not update it and that 'subsequently inflation will run at or below the long-term target of 2 percent' or 'our 2 percent'?  With regard to the 'at least through late 2014,' I was President Williams's I were to argue that point now, the difficult part I I wouldn't fiddle with that at this moment.  Let's defer that to the As to the point of 'significant downside risks,' have 'eased somewhat.' appropriate. President change the beginning of the sentence because we do have a statutory mandate, we do foster both-since we did make a formal statement say stated long-term target of against it in the beginning.  We'll talk about that in the next session.  As to suggestion, I don't think 'until' does it.  If have is with 'at least.'  So second discussion.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Pianalto.

I don't think now is the time to make that adjustment.  I don't think the changes adjust the forward to wait for more information on the pace of the recovery and inflation each MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  In broad terms, my outlook is largely unchanged from our last meeting, so I don't think a change to the current policy stance is warranted.  While some combination of further improvement in the pace of recovery and a pickup in underlying inflation could warrant pulling forward the expected date of policy firming, in the outlook since our last meeting have been material, and before we guidance, I would prefer trends.  I would also prefer to avoid making a practice of moving that date guidance at meeting, because to do so would imply more certainty about the outlook than we really have. Today, with considerable risks still surrounding the recovery, it's hard to rule out the possibility

March 13, 2012

My final reason for holding off on adjusting I don't see having a fresh SEP as a necessary condition for changing the forward to making an adjustment without a new SEP should be fairly high.  In of a significant slowing in the pace of the recovery. the forward guidance is that it would be difficult to explain the change without a new SEP. While guidance, I think the bar my view, the outlook hasn't changed enough since our last meeting to meet that bar.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President George.

The continued decline in initial claims and the last two been particularly encouraging.  Inflation, both headline and core, has growth outlook is likely to keep inflation firm.  Moreover, I note that quarters earlier than they did in January.  In addition, recent research by MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative first half of this growth forecast over the employment reports have picked up, and the stronger both the Tealbook baseline and the constrained optimal policy simulation now have the first tightening of policy two my own staff and other empirical evidence suggest the output gap may be smaller than the Tealbook estimate of 5 percent.

rather than later.  In particular, I think it warrants consideration of 'late 2014' language in the statement.  Clearly, with a high unemployment housing sector, policy will need to remain conditions, inflation near our target, and a return to crisis.  In that regard, beginning to remove Taken together, this information leads me to believe that we should begin removing some accommodation sooner moving forward the rate and only modest improvement thus far in the accommodative for some time.  However, the degree of that accommodation should recognize a persistent recovery, improved economic more-stable financial markets relative to the

unintended consequences that our policies also signal to the market that monetary policy really is accommodation also would help reduce the risk of over the long term might encourage distortions or mispriced risk.  By bringing forward the date specification in the statement, we can conditional, while continuing to provide important information about the likely path for policy in conjunction with our SEP.

I find reasons.  There's evidence they've led to good dual and accountability, because they really provide a good starting point for I like the fact that these rules have the characteristics that would a wide cross section of models and a wide set of eventualities. us with a way to evaluate policy that is less dependent on the particular framework.

One of the things options like A relative to options like B, it would be helpful to have two additional pieces of information from the staff.  So by way of backdrop, like other members of President Plosser has articulated, making of policy.  I'm simple rules attractive for a number of mandate performance in the past.  I think they're a good benchmark to have when we're trying to enhance transparency when we talk to the public about what we are doing.  Perhaps most important, and as President Plosser has already mentioned, lead to good performance across In this way, they provide correctness of any

So once we've done that, we have a path of The second step is to translate these paths of term premium reductions into a path of short-term interest rate reductions that is judged to have an equivalent economic here the staff is currently using a rather simple method of just multiplying that term premium reduction by 4 to get to the short-term interest rate reduction.  That's motivated by, I would say, largely empirical considerations. elegant and interesting memo.  And using their model, we found a different, more theoretically grounded, but still-simple way to do that translation.  And I think it would be useful for the Committee to see both of these kinds of translations-the one they're currently using that comes out in Nelson and Roberts's

We can apply any standard monetary I expect short-term interest rate reductions interest policy rule to decide whether A is better than B, given conditions now and given what for conditions.

One would be the term premium reductions would be the map of the implied short-term interest way of doing that second calculation, which they'd be happy to share with Now, as I talk through this, it should be clear:  I'm using an alternative A.  That's because LSAP adjustment is the I know how to use existing policy rules to evaluate potential augmentations to the But if I'm going to use LSAP adjustment when I think about increasing accommodation as well.  So if I evaluate an alternative like C, it seems I have to also use LSAP-adjusted rule.

In this go-round, I've a rules-based analysis of the size of the balance sheet requires us to LSAP-adjust an even further weakening of the case for To wrap up here, in the economic go-round, I Taylor argued that those rules.  Once we do that, I think we have providing additional accommodation.  In fact, it pushes us closer toward alternatives like C. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

In my view, the appropriate path for constrained optimal control policy than to the paths implied by the outcome-based rule or Taylor's 1999 rule.

We employment and inflation objectives if we respond too slowly to incoming information.  But there are also risks associated with pulling back accommodation too quickly stronger labor market data.  For we became overly optimistic about the economy's toward exit a bit prematurely.  Consequently, I'm concerned by hopeful signs toward policy firming could end up driving inflation further below our objective and retard what is already a long-delayed return to maximum employment.

We have time-tested tools for fighting back if inflation threatens to move persistently above target.

Thus, given the the zero lower bound, I prefer to err on the side of would want to see much clearer evidence of a durable and robust recovery, pressures, before I'd advocate moving up the projected date of tightening.

And so then when I think about increments, I think in terms of quarters. And so far, our short history of moving this date is six quarters at a time.  I confess that considered swapping 'through late 2014' for move.  But while preferences on how we change this guidance may while we debate our preferred behavior.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Governor Duke, the approach you suggest of waiting to change the going to engage in a sequence in the same direction, would you view that as variance with our Wouldn't that imply that sometimes our expectation would be second quarter, but accumulated to move off of 'late 2014'?  Is that consistent with the MR. forward guidance language until we're more confident that we're of moves, or all of the next moves are going to be likely to imply that, at times, we have guidance in the statement that's at expectation? not enough evidence has approach you're advocating?

MS. DUKE.  I'm not entirely sure.

I would just add that I would be reluctant to make any changes, I think we need to think a few a time now.

Thank by certainly in the policy parts of this statement, precisely because meetings at communications and, potentially, policy? table again, I think we'd want to have thought through where going with additional policy measures, and we haven't done so.  On the other hand, if things continue to strengthen and there's no thought of further accommodation, but instead more people begin to talk about tightening, again, we haven't talked through how that would actually proceed okay?

That's why, even though John's good one at some point, I wouldn't do it now.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With respect to the first two paragraphs, I wouldn't change much here except maybe the 'strains in global financial markets' that some continue to pose significant downside risks.  That is, the magnitude of the risk is still pretty near term, abated somewhat.  And I wonder whether a slight, but only a slight, compromise might be to say, 'Strains significant downside

RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As round, the forecast seems to me to be swimming in an ocean of uncertainty economy is functioning in the wake of the financial crisis.  I'm hovering between seeing signs from the labor market, which might signal that a more corner, and seeing income and spending robust recovery.  This position makes me believe that if we maintain our highly accommodative stance too long in the inflation objectives.  If, instead, the increasingly strong employment data lead us to pull back on accommodation, we well below our objective

We know what to do if inflation threatens available and would be deployed if we see that we are overshooting our tightened, we would have a much more our policy options are more limited and I err on the side of continued accommodation and support B.

I better modal economic growth outlook and less tail risk from Europe, extension program is ongoing.  So it doesn't seem like the right time to engage easing measures.  That said, though, I think we should keep the B language changes very minimalist.  In terms of changing the date guidance, moving would be very strongly opposed to that.  First, it would be move to 'late 2014.' meetings, and then we moved it a lot.  To make small adjustments now would you VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

That would lead to higher term premiums would actually lead to a evidence that this is where we want to go for the useful a word about the broad issue.  I favor alternative B, without a change guidance, for a couple of reasons.  First, I don't think it's clear that there's been a very conditions remains is going.  I would raise the related point that if we were to change the their changes, we would like to overall change in views is.  So that's one problem.  A I hope the second round will help clarify, we need to understand better Lacker has been at the forefront here of raising example, that we do on the zero lower for CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  Thank you discussion.  Let me just say to the rate large, discrete change since our last meeting.  Yes, things are more positive, but we still don't have evidence that the recovery is self-sustaining, and the absolute level of quite unsatisfactory.  So I think there's a case, just on the fundamentals here, to take more time to see where the economy date, we don't know what date to change it to at this point.  We don't have the guidance of an SEP.  And while we've heard some people express views about know what the mode is and where the second problem is that, as what this guidance actually means-President this question.  And I think we need to do a better job, perhaps in today's discussion and in subsequent discussions, of explaining what it means.  Now, it could be, for want to include some element of commitment along the lines of the memo bound, where making up for the zero lower bound entails promising to hold rates lower

March 13, 2012

an outcome we would come to.  I'm not saying we will, but my concern is longer.  Maybe that's that we haven't had the discussion yet.

intentionally set up an extra go-round today to really try to get a deeper goal here is to make progress before the next two meetingsand have a press conference, and that are a more subtle determination, a more considered So it's not clear to me that the outlook has changed radically, and I'm not quite sure how we would go about deciding on where to adjust the date if we were adjusting it today.  But more important, we have very understanding of how we should be going forward in terms of our communication.  There are some very important issues.  The both of which happen to be meetings that are two days therefore much more conducive to making determination, and one that we can explain to the public.  Again, for all those reasons, I think it would be premature to make that change today.

I appreciate what President is trying to do with the 'until,' but that's a little too subtle for me, I'm afraid.  And I critical words unchanged.  There were some questions I think these are worth discussing in a more considered The word 'dual' emphasizes the Putting in the '2 percent' for inflation is very should discuss it.  But the symmetry would suggest in that case, NAIRU in the earlier 'anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline gradually toward the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.'  Well, what are those With respect to language, let me make a few comments here. Williams think for today, I would prefer to keep the about 'dual mandate' and '2 percent.' way.  The particular issue, of course, is the following:  Our policy statement tried very hard to maintain the symmetry of employment and inflation objectives. twoness of those objectives.  Now, I don't think, actually, that striking 'dual' would make a big difference, but it's something we ought to discuss. attractive, and I think we looking at what we did in our statement, that we put in the estimate of the sentence where we say levels that

March 13, 2012

So one could put numbers in both sides.  I think, again, that's a question to be discussed. The other things that were raised were about language, and I'm happy to talk about them.  In particular, what do we have? levels? These are critical issues that we need to come back to. mostly

Strike the word 'significant.' VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

It was two things.  One was about the 'strains in global We tried, in the language here-'while having eased somewhat'-to capture 'having eased somewhat' and get rid of the Tarullo suggested:  'Strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks.'  I'm really fine with any of wonder if anyone has any particular preferences.  President Lockhart. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. financial markets.' the point that Governor Tarullo made about the sense that currently they're not quite as bad, and maybe the probabilities are less, but the risk that they pose is still large if it occurs.  So I would make two proposals.  One would be to get rid of the word 'significant'; then you would just be making that adjustment to the sentence.  And the other might be the thing that Governor have eased, though they those things, and I

LOCKHART. I realize I can get caught up technically in whether we're, strictly about strains in global financial markets that exist today, but I just want to concern I was trying to convey in the economy round, and it wasn't about Europe.  It conflict, which then would produce strains in picture and if we going to have an effect on either financial markets or the real risk looms out there. MR. speaking, talking share the was about the Israeli-Iranian potential for a financial markets that we could not very easily, in anticipation, predict.  And I think we're making a mistake if we suggest that that problem isn't part of the potential downplay it as something that's not economy.  So I'd like to keep the word 'significant' in-not, strictly speaking, because it's about financial markets today, but because that

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.

March 13, 2012

Another alternative would be to say, 'Strains in VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes. global financial markets still pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.'  So it would be implicit that things have improved a little bit.

Rather than say 'continue to pose,' I'd just say 'still CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  How is it changed from the previous language?

So I like keeping changing the 'strains.' MS. DUKE.  I like Governor Tarullo's suggestion, and I'm thinking . . . markets, while having eased somewhat' them happening.  But the risk if they do happen is 'significant' and

I'm perfectly fine to go to Governor Tarullo's suggestion, existing language doesn't do exactly what you said. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. but I'm not sure why the would be fine, but I like keeping 'significant,' and I like 'eased MS. DUKE.  Either one somewhat.'

It was the 'somewhat,' Mr. Chairman.  In addition to an aversion to meant to move a little MR. TARULLO. using participles unnecessarily, it was the deletion of 'somewhat' that was bit in the direction of those who thought the probabilities had changed.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I see.  All right.  President Fisher.

March 13, 2012

I think Governor given us a good answer, and I would advocate for that. MR. FISHER.  Having advocated for removing the word 'significant,' Tarullo has we do that?

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Is it okay if

MS. DUKE.  Yes.

I got specific language, was about the housing sector. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  So, 'Strains in global financial markets have eased, though they continue to pose significant downside risks.'

But what I had suggested was, 'Indicators of conditions in the housing amid uncertainty as to will stabilize.'  To say that 'the housing sector remains depressed' is too harsh you guys are going MR.

That's one even other things, like potentially, for example, a common forecast or a variety of things one If we make progress on something related to the statement or to the SEP, could even come to you in April or June with a specific proposal.  If it's that takes a longer lead time, obviously, we won't be able to do that that quickly.  But unchanged, even if the outlook changes, you don't have to make adjustments to the statement. But we didn't succeed in a few to that improvement.  So today, I different ways all, there are some alternative-language paragraphs given in this Those are only there for detail.

And one of the things that those memorandums noted is that according you think that we have credibility to make you we should just be following a robust rule.

What I'm saying here is that, while the communication issue is the preeminent one, the discussion has raised some questions about exactly what we mean by 'optimal,' and I think any that, I will stop and begin a go-round.  And I'll start with Governor Yellen.

I view today's discussion as a further step in Indeed, I see clarifying the linkages between the economic at the present juncture.

This means there's a strategy to the public. and transparency in our policy communications.  Those two characteristics are complementary.  I think we can be proud of the progress the Committee has made on both fronts under the Chairman's leadership.  For instance, the issuance of

Providing a large volume of information attorneys at our table would attest that a classic strategy in corporate litigation is to overwhelm your opponents with at the trial. to have been quite But clarity and transparency may be effective in promoting transparency, but practically useless or even counterproductive in terms of enhancing the clarity of communication.  In fact, the probably truckloads of documents, thereby minimizing their chances of finding a handful of key memos in time to bolster their case postmeeting statements, publish detailed assessments in the SEP.  And the Chairman highlights that information at full transcript of our discussions an appropriate lag, and we may find further ways to enhance transparency.  But at this were the senior management team of corporation, with the public as our shareholders and the Congress as our board of goals of maximum employment and a firm in a mature industry, such a strategic plan might be fairly firm in a fast-moving a more elaborate plan, incorporating not only a With regard to FOMC communications, I believe that our degree of transparency now exceeds that of any other central bank.  We issue minutes three weeks later, and provide summary information about participants' individual economic and policy regular press conferences.  The FOMC is unique in releasing a after stage, our focus, first and foremost, should be on enhancing the clarity of our communications. Consider a corporate analogy.  Suppose that our Committee a large directors.  In effect, our commitment would be to serve the interests of our shareholders, not by maximizing profit or market share but by promoting the price stability.  To maintain shareholders' confidence, every enterprise needs to present a compelling strategic plan.  For brief and simple-in effect, continue with business as usual.  In contrast, a and innovative sector typically requires benchmark strategy but also some discussion of likely responses and key contingencies.  But one

perfect, but I think we can extract two key lessons here.  First, course of is as clearly as possible.  Second, our policy statements.  In contrast, the SEP facilitates any sort of substitute for the Committee's collective communicating those decisions as clearly as possible in our postmeeting In effect, we need to strive for clarity as well as transparency. Of course, no analogy is we need to have a clear strategy and explain it to the public.  Given that financial conditions at the zero bound are particularly tied to the public's expectations regarding the future monetary policy, our effectiveness in promoting maximum employment and price stability crucially dependent on conveying our policy strategy judgments are conveyed through our postmeeting transparency by providing information about our individual economic and policy assessments. But the SEP cannot be viewed as decisionmaking or for statements.

first question, I think it would be very beneficial to clarify our policy contours of the economic outlook over the next several years, not to prevail at the time that policy firming commences.  At recent FOMC consistent proponent of conveying such information in the form of I think that approaches like those presented in the appendix, part B, of the circumnavigating some notable concerns with to aggregate demand shocks, such as a reassessment of the strength of economic growth.

An approach along these lines could be particularly useful in elucidating our response consumer spending, a shift in the fiscal outlook, or the prospects for foreign

Consequently, framing our forward guidance could prove quite helpful in Such shocks would typically warrant a corresponding shift in the anticipated timing of policy liftoff, as expressed by the calendar date in our forward guidance.  But they would not necessarily be associated with any at the time of liftoff. tradeoff between our dual objectives and hence might well call for a projections of unemployment and inflation at liftoff as well as the calendar under such circumstances, this way of conveying the Committee's collective judgment about the most effective way to balance the dual objectives.

However, I prefer to meld that second sentence of paragraph 3.2, which underscores our modal ceiling. firming would not necessarily be triggered by a temporary surge in inflation or a I consider it sensible to regarding the conditions the Committee may judge as calling for the firming.  Paragraphs 3.2 and 3.4 convey that flexibility by the 'near or somewhat below' 7 percent and by pointing to 'the pace of improvement in labor market conditions' and the More specifically, I like the general formulation of paragraph 3.4, which leaves open the possibility that the Committee's next policy move could be in either direction-that is, the onset of policy formulation together with the inflation outlook while avoiding any implication that our 2 percent inflation goal is a Indeed, to underscore this key point, language could be inserted into paragraph 3.2 to explicitly state that policy modest, but more persistent, overshoot above its longer-run goal. preserve some flexibility initiation of policy characterization of unemployment as other relevant factors such as contours of the inflation outlook.

I would personally be recognize that case, I already noted, transparency is no substitute for providing greater clarity about the collective Turning to the second question, the SEP has generally been focused on characterizing the distribution of participants' assessments of the outlook for each economic variable at forecast horizon.  A step toward further transparency time and across variables. the range of participants' judgments about the economic conditions that will be associated with the onset of policy firming.  Nonetheless, it seems without publishing the full matrix of participants' projections, identified by name.  After all, even if that matrix were watchers from participants' speeches and other public comfortable with moving to full transparency for our SEP assessments, but I others around the table may prefer to stick with the current formulation of the SEP.

In contrast, after FOMC, including two stints on the communications I have deep-rooted skepticism about the workability of producing an FOMC Finally, on the third question, I think that the consideration of alternative scenarios could be a very roughly a decade of service on the subcommittee, consensus forecast.  Moreover, even if such an approach were judged to be feasible, it's not clear

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Plosser.

me start by thanking the staff for you don't realize it already, is a journey that seems to go on make it understandable.  As I alluded to in my for doing so puts too much onus on the statement. improving the in terms of MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let putting together this excellent document for organizing our discussion.  I found it very helpful, and I think our communication, if and on and on.  But it's an important one, and it's important that we strive to clarify our monetary policy framework for the public, and to previous remarks, I'm in favor of providing more information to the public.  I think, however, that using the statement as the primary vehicle I believe an effort at improving communications will be served not only by statement language, but also by providing other, more-detailed information communication.

factors that most directly influence policy, as implied by the sorts I and the Committees in the past seem to have favored-for example, ought to talk about our variables as describing the broad arguments of I said.  Unfortunately, we are a ways yet from agreeing on a (1999), Taylor (1993), a first-difference But the arguments always seem to be the same.  Thus, while Regarding the statement, my preference would be that the discussion of data be general and refer primarily to the key of robust rules that variables like inflation, inflation expectations, resource utilization, and such measures.  Those actually tend to be the arguments of many of these robust rules, and so we policies in terms of those.  One can think of these our reaction function, as mathematical expression for that, whether it be Taylor rule, or an outcomes-based rule. these terms are important and informative to the public, they ultimately will not remove the

March 13, 2012

we interpret some of these measures.  For resource utilization-as we know from discussions around can completely squash that, nor do I think we good thing at this point in our evolution toward more judgment or subtle differences among us in how example, the appropriate measures of this table for some time, participants have different views about which measures are appropriate and what their magnitude is.  I don't think we should.  In fact, I view that discussion as a systematic behavior.

we often refer to the general factors in the statement-inflation, inflation I think we fall short is, we fail to draw tight as effectively as we could between the evolution of these measures and the descriptions changes in the behavior of key factors in our reaction function.  If we a meeting, then we should be able to explain why in terms of factors.  After all, that's how the robust rule is telling you to behave.  If your communication when you deviate. manner consistently-and I emphasize could greatly enhance the market and the public's understanding of our more approach, thus improving communications and the transparency and policy. Currently, expectations, and resource utilization.  But where linkages of our policy actions.  For example, I believe we should seek to explicitly link the actions in our policy statement to the choose to ease or tighten policy at the changes in these key we can't do so, then it seems to me it's incumbent on us to explain why.  And indeed, that's part of the value of these robust rules-it improves Describing our policy actions in the statement in this 'consistently'-we systematic policy predictability of monetary

President Williams alluded to in his remarks earlier today, when you get to the I think it's very dangerous for us to design policies and frameworks in the As I alluded to earlier, and as there are times when crises or other issues intervene from a normal operating procedure, from these simple rules.  And President Williams talked about what happens lower bound.  But

March 13, 2012

we have a benchmark that we're deviating from.  I think it's midst of grappling with departures from our policies.  I would prefer us, in terms of moving forward, to think about simple policy rules in a normal operating framework.  And then when it comes time, whether it be the zero bound or some other circumstance where we'd need to deviate from that for some reason, dangerous to design policies and frameworks that are importantly operative only in extreme cases.

seen by looking at the scatterplot of inflation and unemployment in the provided to the Committee in its package at our you recall, there are participants whose conditions in terms of inflation and generally prefer something closer to 3.3. One can view the thresholds that are contained in some of the examples in the memo in that light, but I'm very much against providing thresholds.  Particular thresholds are tied to particular views of the Phillips curve, for which there's no consensus on this Committee.  The lack of consensus can be SEP projections at the time of liftoff, which was last meeting.  As unemployment rates at the time of liftoff might have been very similar, but their views of when that liftoff occurred differed substantially.  Thus, in terms of the prototype language provided in the appendix of the staff's communication memo, I That's not my preferred language, but it's closer because it doesn't have the triggers, obviously.

opportunity to make progress in looking at alternative C in the from this time.  President Bullard recommended the last sentence of paragraph 3, which reads, 'The Committee . . . anticipates that this exceptionally federal funds rate will be appropriate only as long as inflation is projected to medium term, longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well I'm a little word 'insufficient,' but the point is, it's explaining a reaction function. I also think there's an statement language alternative C, low range for the remain subdued over the anchored, and progress toward maximum employment remains insufficient.' uncomfortable with the

March 13, 2012

explaining the terms of our reaction function, and I think that's the direction we need to go. I mentioned earlier on simple rules a big help.  So I would encourage the staff and the Committee to continue to explore robust I think it will be informative for the It's In general, though, even this paragraph can be improved, and the links can become tighter relative to our actions.  So in that regard, the memos that were rules-what their implications are and how they perform. Committee.

communicate the way we carry out monetary policy, though, central banks.  It need not be as of economic growth, unemployment, and well as the I've said for some time, for I believe the value of the SEP assessments of appropriate policy is going to accrue watch how those variables change over time-not what they say at a point very important part of our transparency.  As understanding about the systematic way we conduct policy and the In order to more effectively we need to consider relying on more than just the FOMC statement, which by its nature has to be terse.  In that regard, I think we should consider producing something that looks more like a monetary policy report along the lines of those produced at other long or as detailed, and our current SEP provides a platform for moving in that direction.  A key feature of the report would be to provide forecasts inflation, and convey a measure of uncertainty surrounding those forecasts.  In turn, these variables could be linked to the behavior of inflation or resource utilization that various members of the Committee find useful.  The appropriate path of monetary policy and the uncertainty associated with that path should be directly discussed in terms of the evolution of the key variables.  Doing so would help convey the state-contingent nature of policy, as inherent inertia that's built into systematic or robust policy rules. example, that to the public as they in time, but how they evolve.  And I think that's a the public gains a higher

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  Vice Chairman.

I see it, the conditions and in the economic outlook.  The second economy and federal funds rate path forecasts; and, two, the lack of discrimination create difficulty for people translating what the SEP to what it implies for what the Committee is actually deciding.  We saw that at the before the end of 2013, way to get around ambitious. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As communication strategy right now is suffering from two shortcomings.  First, the statement and the SEP currently provide very little basis for understanding what the date-currently late 2014-is based on.  And it doesn't provide much basis for understanding how that date might change in response to changes in economic problem is that, I think, the SEP is a mess in two important respects.  One, it's not a consistent set of real between voters and nonvoters really does means back last meeting, when there were six people that, in the SEP, had takeoff and people had trouble reconciling that with the 'late 2014' date.  And the that, of course, is to clarify the difference between voters and nonvoters.  I think our goal should be to fix both of these problems, so we should be date rests on, was putting language in the statement that identified There are many more important unemployment rate and inflation, including how fast the economy is in the probability distribution is around the forecast, and the permanent Now, I originally thought the best way forward on the first problem, in terms of understanding what the thresholds for the unemployment rate and inflation.  But my thinking has evolved.  I'm not as inclined to go in that direction, for several reasons.  First, I think we found that it's hard for the statement to communicate any nuance about the choices. parameters than just the growing, what the skew

March 13, 2012

I have concluded is that the date has actually worked expected.  Even though I think that it would be nice to know what the fairly successful at achieving some of our objectives. knocking on my door, be a better way to or transitory nature of the shocks affecting the economy.  So it's hard in a statement to really capture that nuance.  The second thing better than I would have date rests on, the date has actually been Market participants don't seem particularly troubled-I don't have people saying, 'Where are the damn thresholds?'  And, third, I think there might communicate how the date is linked to our projections.

I would propose as the solution to these problems, recognizing is just my take on things.  The first thing in would exclude the Chairman.  And it should be arrayed by voters and nonvoters.  I have no could live either way.  The only advantage anonymous is, even if people can figure out who the people are, you still maintain I would argue for is that the that emerges from the SEP-in center of the distribution of these SEP forecasts.  So the vote is not on what Committee stands.  What I think it allows you to accomplish is, you with where the center of the distribution was, but you could actually vote going to happen two or So let me describe what that I'm open-minded about other solutions.  This terms of fixing the SEP-I think there should be a matrix.  The matrix should have 16 forecasts. I view on whether it's anonymous or not anonymous.  I of being plausible deniability, if that's important to you.  The second thing FOMC would vote on what it views as the consensus forecast other words, the forecasts people personally favor, but represents what people think represents the center of the distribution of where the could disagree affirmatively that that center of the distribution was in fact accurate.  And then the third thing is, I think we really do need to do some work on showing the uncertainty around the forecast.  We are pretending or implying an accuracy about our judgment about what's

March 13, 2012

work in terms of showing three years out that's pretty laughable, frankly.  So we need to do some uncertainty.

out of this combination?  Well, first of all, the SEP forecasts now you actually have a consistent set of Second, market participants can distinguish between voters and nonvoters.  And I But it allows people to make that distinction, which is meaningful. forecast, so the SEP then becomes a tool to use to of the distribution of the Committee is.  You exclude the Chairman communicate about what that consensus view is during the it are a variety of views and there can be quite a bit of disagreement within the you run up to the meeting would have to change.  You'd have to get the Tealbook you'd have to have a chance for people to get the SEP in, and there'd have is of the distribution of But I think all of those things are achievable if we want to do it. What do I think you get link the real variables to the federal funds rate forecast, so forecasts. don't think this disenfranchises nonvoters.  Nonvoters still get to express their views and still communicate in the meeting. Third, the Committee votes on a consensus extract where the center because his forecast is more important than anyone else's forecast.  And it also gives the Chairman a little bit of flexibility to press conference.  Market participants get both the projected liftoff date and the real economic variables that accompany it in the consensus forecast.  But the SEP process still exists, and shows that there Committee, so you don't lose that.  Now, obviously, in doing this, the logistics of the timing in terms of how out a little bit earlier, to be a chance for the staff to make some views on, well, what the center the SEP forecasts.

found that the questions were I'm I'm sympathetic with where President Plosser is.  I just think it's difficult Now let me turn to the questions that were asked, because I a little bit more episodic, so I wanted to first present a more holistic view.  The first question was, should the statements be used to link the economic outlook and its decision variables? not opposed to this, but

March 13, 2012

When I look at the 'expects' seems too strong.  This is a pretty broad range of forecasts that are actually likely.  In 3.2, the 'will become appropriate' seems too strong to me.  I like the 3.4 language betteranticipates.'  Alternative 3.3 is fine in terms of what it says, but it really doesn't all about how you link the real-side variables back to the date.  And 3.4, I problem that I mentioned before of putting so percent? lower unemployment rate than 7 percent, but we don't really tell you tradeoffs is, so it's very incomplete. for the statement to carry the water that we want it to carry in that respect. four alternatives-3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4-I don't like 3.1 because not what we expect to happen; this is something that we think could happen or is likely to happen.  But there's language 'currently communicate much at think, is the best of the lot, but it suffers from the much weight on just two key parameter values.  And, for example, what happens if the inflation rate is 1 percent?  What unemployment rate would be acceptable if inflation was 1 Presumably, a somewhat what the combination of answers to all of the questions-2.a., 2.b., 2.c.-are I said, I'd like to use the SEP, though, to actually develop our forecast. On the second set of questions, my yes in terms of fixing the SEP.  And as a center of the Committee's distribution with respect to

to develop some right now, we're implying precision embarrassing for us.  If you've run this out 10 years, you can imagine people Fed thought this was going to happen two years out.'  Imagine if we'd done a big fan chart that at least gives us a chance of incorporating some of the bad And regarding the third question, I think the big thing we need to do is way of showing uncertainty around our forecast, because that's going to be saying, 'Well, the this in 2007, for example-where we ended up in 2009-that would have been embarrassing.  So I'd like to have outcomes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard.

March 13, 2012

you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me begin by apologizing for my I not follow President Evans in the future.  Let me also say, I'd request that President Evans No, I do apologize.  That was wrong of me, and I don't want to have MR. BULLARD.  Thank impolitic comments to President Evans in the previous round.  I'd like to request, Mr. Chairman, that not follow me.  [Laughter] the camaraderie around here break down.

MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Jim.

'Should the Committee's postmeeting statements be used to provide a very traditional answer to this question, which is no, and I'm The answer is that we should not attempt to we already have.  I'll give two versions of this answer:  a simple version the years-is that the Committee needs to preserve flexibility and, for this reason, The need to preserve flexibility has long been a tenet of the are of a nature that in response to a small set of variables strikes me as imprudent, and I MR. BULLARD. information about the links between the Committee's economic outlook and its policy decisions?'  I'm going to give going to reword the question like this:  To what extent should the Committee write down or otherwise fully commit to its monetary policy rule? commit any further than and a models-based version.  The simple version-and one that has been used, I think, in Committee for should not commit in an overly detailed way to possible courses of future action.  And the key words there are 'overly detailed.' Committee's policymaking and, I think, has stood the test of time.  The fact is that many unexpected shocks will hit the U.S. economy in the future, as they have in the past, and Vice Chairman Dudley was just mentioning 2008-09.  Many of these shocks would be very difficult to contemplate ahead of time.  Therefore, suggesting that we commit to taking certain actions only advise against it.  So that's the simple version.

March 13, 2012

and that commitment to that rule gist of my However, I do not think that this commitments in actual control exercises are in relatively simple Svensson, an optimal control model led to a Taylor-type policy rule as the characterization of the That is certainly interesting, and indeed, I do think that exercises of this type and more complex, the policy rules suggested by control exercise also become quite complex.  It becomes, in fact, impractical to think it makes sense to listen to the wisdom of previous Committees action.  That is indeed true in some models, circumstances, this is exercise.  I would regard that literature as in its infancy and not ready for us to coincidence-that is, that the models as they exist today.  The models are and financial stability that have been so important Now, from the point of view of macroeconomic models, it's true that well-constructed optimal control exercises will suggest an optimal policy rule, would provide a fully optimal monetary policy in some model environments, and the comments here is that that's going to be very model-specific. fact should push the Committee toward attempting to make unlikely policymaking.  Most of the contemplated optimal models.  In one famous example from the 1990s due to Lars exercise in a very simple optimal policy. should inform the Committee on how best to proceed.  Unfortunately, simple models do not match reality well, and as models become more the optimal delineate all the responses called for by the optimal policy rule in all the possible states of the world.  For this reason, I and not attempt to go further down this impractical path.  Some may have the intuition, coming from parts of the optimal control literature, that simple rules can approximate complex rules and, therefore, we should commit to simple courses of and some around the table have done research in this area.  Under certain the robust rules adopt it in actual policymaking.  The reality is that such a happy simple rule will approximate the complex rule that we don't know-is quite unlikely if we face up to the true deficiencies in the macroeconomic particularly weak on aspects of financial crises

The models are also very weak in the sense that there is little or no concept of behavior, and globalization-could be ways, with differing implications for optimal policy calculations. in recent bubble phenomena, such as a housing bubble or a land price bubble, in most models.

that I do not think promises by this years in the future are credible.  President Kocherlakota talked about this can and does see that the incentives of the Committee at the when the promise begins to bite will be to deviate from the promised policy.  In well, the Committee will years earlier.  I talked with a banker of our current policy.  He was no macroeconomist, but he as 'cheap' since it will be easy to renege on the promise in the and the macro-policy games Some have the view that we can be extra-resolute in making our promises and that the credibility problem, but to me, the issue is that the incentives of the Committee in the In addition to these arguments, I want to reiterate Committee several earlier today.

we've already heard comments along this line, good place for this.  There's just too much uncertainty about what's sure we're conveying very much information, I've already alternative C.  I think that would be a fine way to do it.  Then think, as originally until the next meeting.  But as is a sequence of a long period of time.  So really, you're asking people to support policies tenuous to talk at one year and then person Y votes the next year, given the nature of the Turning to specific questions, on 1.b.-should we look at trying to characterize the outlook over the medium run?-I don't think, and that the policy statement is a going to happen in the medium run.  And I'm not so it would be increased verbiage without much message.  As for the calendar date, argued today that it's confusing and should be removed.  President Plosser summarized how that might be done with language from we wouldn't have to change the date or think about changing the date or have financial market speculation about changing that date.  On the participants versus members, this issue is becoming increasingly tenuous around the table here because we're talking about-I conceived, the Committee would meet, make a decision, and wait modern ideas have infiltrated this room, it's becoming more that the policy promised actions over in the future that are being decided today.  I think it's becoming increasingly about, person X votes policy decisions we're trying to implement here.

good.  I and more direct things that we can do about the SEP in the short term. the longer term, I'm happy to do any of the things listed in 2.a. through 2.d., but I think it's and a On the enhancements to the SEP, 2.a. through 2.d.-first of all, I support President Kocherlakota and his memo and the suggestions there.  I thought those were very viewed those as simpler In leading inexorably to a situation where each FOMC participant will produce a full forecast

March 13, 2012

I'm not that sure that it's actually desirable to go in that direction.  I I'm not sure it's desirable.  I suggest instead that the United Kingdom has largely we're trying to solve here in a sensible way, and that we should follow monetary policy report.  To me, this is what the financial markets, and the Fed.  They want to know the basic contours of our policy report.  One advantage of a report of markets and other observers.  We can put in and so on, which I think would be really helpful, and it's the can't do in the SEP.  Our current methods of providing information on just a are not giving a full picture, nor will they ever provide a full picture along the full rationale for policy. think there were times in the past when individual Banks would put out their individual forecasts, and I'm not sure we want to go in that direction.  That sounds like a mess to me.  I'd be willing to go there, but solved the problem that their lead.  The solution is to provide a quarterly assessment and outlook for the U.S. economy similar to the U.K.'s public more generally, crave from the viewpoint, and this could be conveyed in a monetary this type is that a complete picture of the outlook for the economy can be provided, including nuances about many issues of interest to financial the special box on gasoline prices kind of thing we few variables route that we're going.

You can't, say, always got to predict that you're doing it under optimal policy.  The policy well in the U.K. by incorporating the market expectations at the time the report is constructed, and that works very well.  That would give the more of the character of a true forecast, in the same spirit that other and so to me, this is a great advantage of going in this The policy own conception of the best policy predict high inflation in the future or deflation in the future.

However, reaching such a consensus does not seem practical best to forecast the economy and of the appropriate monetary policy given the uncertainties in understanding the economy and the the diversity of views expressed around the table is a strength of our system.  Trying to force consensus around a forecast might hurt, rather than help, the deliberative process. consensus forecast may not be practical or desirable, explicitly linking individual policy paths and economic outlooks addition, if the identity of the participant is provided, the public will know which projections correspond to voters and which to nonvoters, a distinction that is important likely policy actions of the Committee.

Over time, I quality of our individual specific about we expect would result in a significant change in policy.

My second choice would be paragraph 3.2, but which does not provide specific economic triggers, we should continue to use forward guidance with calendar dates because it has proven to be had a meaningful impact on medium- and long-term interest rates.

that there are was put in the appendix.  The four points are, I think we have a lack of clear consensus regarding the role of the SEP; second, I believe, as one or more, that it's desirable to get away from date guidance; third, current practice is that we publish them only four and we have eight meetings a year; and, fourth, it's desirable that the specifics of few more points-not exhaustiveMR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think it's obvious already a lot of moving parts here, and the questions and the subquestions reflect that.  So to be selective today, I'd like to make four points in overview, and then I'll elaborate further on some of them and comment on the specifics of the language that first, has already been stated by there are complications introduced by elevating the role of the SEP, which I think we already have in policy communications, given that the times a year any economic conditionality be durable.  So let me make a partly in elaboration of those and some other points.

I said, I think there's a lack of consensus regarding the role of the SEP practice, and good for the group to step back and have a discussion on this before is that the SEP provides background color and FOMC participants as a group are connecting the dots between desired how future doing that.  But at the same time, I would argue that the SEP should not I am a little reluctant to go As maybe it would be implementing any further changes.  My own view texture that supplement the postmeeting statement and the minutes.  The SEP provides a broad sense of how the economic outcomes and policy.  If we're trying to convey in general terms Committees might react to economic conditions, one could argue that using the SEP is a more inclusive way of substitute for actionable, consensus-based votes of the Committee.

March 13, 2012

public or Fed watchers to indulge in what I call FOMC Kremlinology.  I we want to add a bit more information to get closer to the year, the value of distinguishing between voters and nonvoters degrades as you closer to year-end. down the road of providing information in the SEP at an individual level.  I don't think it's healthy to encourage the do think an idea worth considering, if constitution of the current Committee, would be to show who are permanent members and who are revolving members, but not necessarily just focus on the current Committee.  After all, in any given calendar get

I expressed in the policy round, as likely to be a problem going forward, and at conditionality language if we hold to that language. accept that using the statement to provide more information on the Committee's reaction could be helpful and could deliver some incremental stimulus, is added to accomplish this observe the I'd also favor words that add example, the unemployment rate. Now, on the specific question related to the statement, as I see forward guidance in terms of a calendar date a minimum, I would suggest downplaying the date of liftoff by stating the economic conditionality first and putting focus on the I do function and policy conditionality and I would strongly prefer that any language that principle of policy decisions being outlook based or forecast based. some flexibility to deal with the notional reliance on a single indicator for mandate consistency-for alternative 3.1 in the appendix.  I think a forecast-based 'medium-term inflation outlook' does this as well.  A focus on the I've already suggested, in that changing labor force elevated even while there is robust employment 'including the pace of improvement in labor market conditions' helps So, following from those points, I actually prefer it qualifies the quantitative thresholds with the word 'nearing' that suggests discipline.  The phrase unemployment rate could be problematic, as participation could keep the unemployment rate growth.  So the phrase

March 13, 2012

3.1 because it's simple and concise.  To me, 3.2 adds complexity, would say the use of a reference to inflation expectations is helpful.  It is, in my mind, the statement and with this problem.  I like although I covered by the expression 'medium-term inflation outlook' in 3.1.  Alternative 3.3 strikes me as a restatement of the balanced-approach policy principle, and 3.4 lengthens adds more complexity than I think is advisable.

year's and the following votes to determine whether a I do want to mention that, as regards the unemployment 3.1, I would err on the side of something higher than 7 percent, given all 'close to or somewhat below' to simply 'close to.' Regarding the quantitative thresholds themselves, the levels should be chosen with the intent that they be durable and therefore constrain to some degree next year's voting Committee.  So I think the numerical thresholds have to be decided with the full deliberation involving all participants using techniques like straw consensus actually exists, and then that can be voted on by the Committee.  Today, we're not really deliberating on the specifics, but threshold in alternative of the imprecision around questions like the level at which the unemployment rate would begin to generate inflation pressures and the speed at which pressures might develop.  Also, perhaps alternatively, I would change forecast, I think President Rosengren suggested and not, in the end, all that productive.  I think views at the table Committee, and the forecast information in the fleshed out, can suffice to give this sense of what the consensus is.  Thank you, Chairman. Finally, on the question of a consensus the same thing.  It strikes me as a painful process the SEP can and should be used to provide the public with a sense of all the that inform the deliberations of the formal voting SEP, if fully Mr.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Williams.

Italian, Thai food, seafood, whatever? food court and everybody gets their own.  [Laughter] MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The discussion so far reminds me quite a bit of our family discussions at home over what to have for dinner.  Typically, it revolves around two issues.  One is, no one is happy with the food choices we have in the house.  Second is, everybody is very hungry.  So we debate:  Should it be And in the end, we go to the few years, this Committee has steadily improved our communication with policy outlooks.  We've made a lot of progress.  We've identified the can do more to illuminate the connection between the two, between the policy outlooks-that is, to communicate our reaction function.  And following up on what President Plosser said.  I think that really is our main goal, and Actually, I view paragraphs 3.1 or discussion should be concise and convey only the most Over the past economic and monetary food court.  I think we economic and monetary here, I'm the FOMC statement can certainly do better in this regard. 3.2 or 3.4-any of them-as being improvements over what we're currently doing.  Now, in keeping with past statements, any important points.  If we try to convey too many nuances, the key points will get lost.

alternatives of paragraph 3, I have a slight preference for version 3.1, which and kind of information.  Notably, I do think the statement outlook changes.  In Also, given the relative stability of the economic conditions at liftoff versus the end of paragraph 3 after laying out the Lockhart mentioned.  I for paragraph 3.2, shown on page 5 of the Among the provides, to me, the right amount should still provide a policy liftoff date, and that date should evolve as the contrast, the economic conditions projected to hold at the time of liftoff will likely remain relatively stable. liftoff date, I would move the calendar date to the economic conditions that underlie the policy, which I think President don't see the advantage to providing additional forecast detail over the medium run in the statement as illustrated in the alternative language

March 13, 2012

outlook and the policy decision. handout.  Again, I think the focus of our statement is not on the forecast per se, but on the relationship between the expectations with our own expectations and about the future path of policy, and I do believe that over time, as our for economic activity, inflation, and the funds rate evolve, the public will get a better reaction function.  Further enhancements a very good job of because of that, somewhat nervous about the idea of publishing the the participants, because, again, it would highlight more of the dispersion.  I think have made, is now In a perfect world, we would all agree on a nirvana, a useful intermediate step would be to highlight a page from surveys of private-sector forecasts, such as the SPF or the Blue Chip. for a few key aggregates.  Now, the median has a very good summary statistic of the distribution, a it would be useful for the SEP table 1 to include the medians of all the projections, The SEP can also help align the public's reduce uncertainty forecasts picture of the state-contingent nature of our policy could be made to the SEP to speed that process along.  Now, we are doing portraying the dispersion in the views of the participants, so I don't think we need to go further in that direction.  And I am, full matrix of what we need to do, and this follows on a number of comments that people provide clearer views on what the consensus of the Committee is, and we could do a better job of describing the central view of the participants. Committee forecast and publish that, as the Bank of England does.  That is best practice in many ways.  But until we reach this forecast something closer to the central view of the participants already.  And I believe that President Plosser already mentioned this idea, but we've been thinking about this quite a bit, and that is, we could take Their press releases focus on the median forecast some desirable statistical properties.  It's good summary statistic of the center of the Committee, and it's relatively insensitive to outliers. In particular, including the economic variables and the funds rate.  As it stands, until the minutes are released,

March 13, 2012

computing the midpoint of the press conference would help focus attention on the central view of the message. market participants summarize the Committee's forecast by central tendency.  Publishing the medians of the economic and interest rate projections just before the Chairman's participants, which could help, I think, clarify our

SEP to forecasts for GDP growth, ranges would reinforce the notion that our outlook for the future path of contingent.  Thank you. Finally, again, a point that's already been made-it would be useful for the include more information about uncertainty.  In particular, I think it would be useful for the SEP to start including uncertainty intervals for the funds rate, just as it does for other economic variables.  Table 2 in the SEP summarizes the historical accuracy of unemployment, and inflation, but it doesn't do so for the funds rate, even though short-term interest rate forecasts are subject to considerable uncertainty, as we've already discussed. Adding these confidence the funds rate is not an exogenous commitment but depends on how economic conditions evolve. In other words, it's state

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Evans.

language mean, and how I think the questions were largely about that, at any rate.  And as I we need to was a would want to resolve this in we decide to resolve it, we ought to maintain that status quo.  If we didn't, then it would MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I approach this discussion this afternoon more from the perspective of, where are we today, and what does the '2014' might we deal with that? thought about this, it seems to me that if we try to clarify beyond the calendar date, keep in mind a principle, which is, this is a communications issue, and 'late 2014' particular policy judgment of the Committee, and so I think we order to keep the level of forward accommodation unchanged.  That is, the hard decisions that were taken in August and January imparted some type of forward indication about policy, and however

March 13, 2012

weaken the language.  And of course, that I looked at the suggestions that had different economic thresholds, of course, I personally would like, and that's part of accommodative than just 'late 2014,' be a tightening, presumably, if we were to somehow could be the policy choice, but that's a policy choice as opposed to a communications issue. Because of that, as not all of the numbers corresponded to numbers that what this principle is about.  I had in mind something more so I would have to back off of that, too, and everybody would have to focus on what this means.

read the policy memos that were circulated it this way or I just started thinking about it myself. Let's suppose we could be put into three different buckets, that we subscribe to.  So I don't think it's a particular interest rate rule, I else has an interest rate rule that's that one of would like something even later than that, core decision, which is consistent with 'no earlier than late 2014.'  Well, a forecast-your economic forecast, your inflation going to run it through those rules, and they would indicate a liftoff at core decision as of last I think that's how we would want to think about it.  So my 7-3 numbers in thinking about the way it was labeled, I what the about.  I think ultimately, that's a judgment that a larger number of people I thought about that. The question is, what does this mean?  As I before this meeting, either they talked about I think part of the issue is like this. right?  There are three different interest rate rules outside of people's imagination that President Plosser would have would have a particular interest rate rule, and somebody somewhere in between us.  According to public commentary, we each have indicated us would like an earlier takeoff than late 2014, and I and then presumably, the middle-road person likes the this conditions-we're different points.  The key is, how do we describe the liftoff for that August and in January? for unemployment and inflation wouldn't work, but thought these 7-2 numbers, with the right emphasis on medium term, were probably FOMC decision was would have to come to, but that's how

March 13, 2012

us, I tended to with Governor Yellen's choices on so many of them.  I think that alternative 3.4, which easing, was a good option to include in that type of language.  I thought especially liked that the inflation responsibilities-that 2 percent is not a ceiling-so we should be willing go over that if it were consistent with the way things were performing.  More above and below our objectives as we So in terms of the particular examples of language that were put in front of agree allowed for further melding in some of the language from 3.2 could work, too.  I characterization was with a medium-term orientation.  That's in keeping with how we think about our dual mandate to perhaps generally, we still have to clarify our tolerance for ranges put that into our policy statement, but that's something we need to do.

these statements is quite helpful.  And what else? could be acceptable.  I'm FOMC statement said governance of the Committee-but the 17 SEP forecasts said something I think we have to add some type of clarity to that.  If we identify the forecasts, that I think that keeping the calendar date in One thing-on the SEP, I think that publishing the matrix of forecasts fine with that.  That solves this issue that we ran into in January where the one thing-that's the different. would certainly do it.

type of comment that we hear periodically, or we might all subscribe to at some point.  I is.  We need a vehicle to describe the actions that the Committee has taken, and if I can see a lot committee.  So I Some have mentioned that we don't want to load too much on the policy statement.  This is a don't know what the alternative is to the policy statement.  I don't know what the practical alternative we're reluctant to describe something, it takes policy tools off the table if we can't describe it.  If the Committee were willing to cede this communications tool to the Chairman through his speeches or a longer statement after the meeting, that's worthy of consideration. of merit in that, but that would be a very different type of monetary policy

March 13, 2012

believe we ultimately have to think about this.  The FOMC statement under our current Committee governance is our best joint collaborative effort, and that's important to maintain.

regarding the discussion about optimal commitment, that there are some good points about this, and my own staff has pressed me hard on this issue.  It's optimal I commit to it, but commitment is all in, and how do you convince people of that?  That we need to think about, but I'm reluctant, if not loath, to cede the that might be implementable in some fashion.  I think rules might be able to replicate some of that because, you highlight them, writ large, it would be very embarrassing if we were to back off.  The that I've talked about before have that element as well.  I believe it's worth a lot of I certainly recognize how difficult they are.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I suppose, lastly, very policy if is a real-world issue that opportunity to improve upon what we can do for the economy and inflation more generally without at least thinking about policy rules that's where the nominal income targeting once thresholds work, at least, to think about what efforts we might do to build up the credibility of these actions, but

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Pianalto.

communicating more date.  Our discussions this morning illustrated the many pitfalls of using a date.  Also, we agreement on the conditions for a move, even though we may disagree on the true if the main source of our disagreement is about the pace of the we appear to disagree on what we regard as the reaction function to the outlook, and it is this difference that poses the strongest MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support the idea of about how the Committee's outlook affects its policy decisions, and I'd like to think that we can find a way before too long to provide more conditions-based guidance than date-based guidance. In principle, including inflation and unemployment thresholds would have an advantage over using a may have more timing.  This is especially recovery in our outlooks.  In practice, however, appropriate

March 13, 2012

examined the recent SEP and our projections for the economy, their analysis indicated tool of the Taylor rule, it could be hard to an unemployment threshold that accurately summarizes the guidance to the public.  I worry, we find it hard to come up with compromise wording that accounts for rates and other differences in our views on challenge for reaching agreement on thresholds.  When my staff projections for appropriate policy that a large part of the difference in the takeoff date could be attributed to differences in what we submitted for our long-run unemployment rate.  With considerable dispersion in our views of such a fundamental variable, which is a key input come up with a statement regarding range of the Committee's views and provides simple and clear however, that if differences in our longer-run unemployment appropriate policy, it would likely be too complicated to still be informative.

with Governor Yellen's comments earlier about clarity versus So I have a preference for a straightforward statement, and quantitative thresholds form a consensus around paragraph 3.1 in part B, I could support it.  I do worry, as around this simple phrasing would be hard to For example, I estimate my long-run unemployment rate at 6 percent, and so I would be 7 percent, with the phrase that was included in the language of B.3.1 that talked about in labor markets.  So I would be more comfortable with a a as long as we have more I'm confident that the subcommittee I totally agree transparency. would be the most straightforward.  But again, if we could legitimately a straightforward statement, such as we've been talking this afternoon, that consensus achieve. more comfortable with an unemployment threshold of 7½ percent.  However, I could accept close to the pace of improvement straightforward, clearer statement, but given the difficulty that we're hearing about reaching consensus, I would be willing to support some qualitative language assurance that the qualitative language would provide clarity.  Again, after listening to this afternoon's discussions, I know that is a huge challenge, but

March 13, 2012

challenge.  I want us to avoid making still more changes to our recent changes and for us to better understand enact on communications is up to this communications that could be hard for the public to interpret.  In my view, there is a lot to be said for waiting and letting the public digest our the strengths and weaknesses of further communications changes in our policies before we further enhancements.

2 of enhancements that are listed or suggested by question 3, I good ideas worth considering.  I'd like to have more analysis about what we would we be hoping of these ideas?  So I'd be open to more discussion about these various I'm not ready today to select any specific proposal.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So with that said, I do like the idea of incorporating some medium-term language in paragraph 2.  The current language that we use is too short-term focused.  Paragraph alternative C is about right in length, and it leaves further details to the SEP or the Chairman's press conferences.  Regarding other think they are all think the strengths and weaknesses of each of these ideas would be.  What to accomplish with each ideas, but

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President George.

formal comments and just react to a couple of things.  One I have been leaning while in terms of given the I think are important changes here.  Regarding I looked at the questions, I really was Yellen made about trying to be careful between clarity.  And so as I looked more at what would be clearer, then you get drawn MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Given the comments that have been made to this point, I'm going to set aside my is, given the changes that we've made so far in our communication strategy, toward the comments that President Pianalto made about letting things sit a what we've already put out there and being very cautious in making further changes short amount of time in which we've made what the connection between the outlook and the policy, as drawn to the comment that Governor transparency and

March 13, 2012

specific.  I could not satisfy myself, as I looked really took into account the full range of things that we think difficult to come to terms with-balancing the flexibility that what we're doing. go back to the document on the longer-run goals and strategy, which laid I think we had been-what it is we are I'm satisfied with that piece, at least for the time being. to things like thresholds or things that seem more at the 'more specifics,' that they about, which is what makes this President Bullard talked about with trying to be clearer to the public about And in that sense, I out-albeit not in very specific terms, but clearer than looking at in terms of our objectives.  So

I'd go as far as range of views.  I think we should be careful that Committee to come to a decision.  And so can do Thank you. As it relates to the SEP, I also have mixed feelings there.  I don't know if Vice Chairman Dudley in saying it's a mess, but it might be close.  That said, I think we should not put too much on those projections, too.  Now that we've put them out there, it's fair for the public to look at that as being background to a they not get in the way of the responsibility of the looking at those in the context of focusing on their central tendency might be the best we in the near term.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.

I'm going to make the mistake of abandoning what I had written up So let me start by talking about the contents of what should be in the being a lowest common denominator, and this as well.  I think about the things we always talk about clear MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As President George just said, a lot has been said already. and try to be more reactive. FOMC statement.  I thought of what was in 3.3 as gets at what President Plosser was saying as being important variables for consideration inside the FOMC statement.  We talk about inflation, inflation expectations, and resource utilization.  I don't know if we're always as as we should be that what concerns us, really, is the outlook for those variables because of the

March 13, 2012

a lag-that's something that President I don't think that we're as careful right now in the statement about Vice Chairman Dudley conditions, et cetera, but I think we have to be pretty we are deviating from those variables.  Now, I mean to be quite verbal in I'm saying here.  I'm not talking about explicit numbers, but more trying to say, here are care about:  inflation, resource utilization, and inflation expectations.  In particular, resource utilization, it's an outlook-I would say a near-term outlookthis and that-and if we can't do I don't think our statement gets this right at even a verbal level, and so jumping suddenly to being explicit about going to be putting in-I don't think we're ready for that, because, as I said, we I would like to see. fact that we think of monetary policy operating with Lockhart emphasized. explaining our actions and inactions in terms of our outlook for inflation and resource utilization and the perceived state of inflation expectations.  It doesn't mean we always act just based on that outlook, of course.  We might deviate from that for reasons that talked about in terms of financial market explicit about why what the things we in terms of inflation and something like 18 to 24 months.  And we should be able to explain, when we don't move and when we move, why we're doing that-because of changes in that, if there's something else, we should be articulate about that. right now numbers we're don't even have the verbal part as right as

I will say, I'm a math formula guy-I love I talk to somebody who's not an economist, they're much more skeptical about People who are not in the Economic Research Department but are involved in in our FOMC process are very skeptical about, 'Can you really distinguish what that Is that really what the NAIRU is now for the Committee?'  I think numbers absolutely not trying to close the I think we have to recognize where we are now, which is, we don't even In terms of putting numbers in the statement, it.  But whenever the utility of this. discussions 7 percent means? are harder to communicate about than we might think.  I'm door on that totally, but

March 13, 2012

a verbal level in the statement.  We have to get going to have to have a date.  I dissented in August, when the date was first adopted, but it to want to know and for us to offer guidance about in want to know; I think that's what we really have a description of a reaction function at that right, and then we can talk about putting numbers into the statement.  In the interim, I think we're was not about the inclusion of the date.  It was about the time of the date, the actual date itself. A date is a very reasonable thing for people our statement at the zero lower bound.  That's what they should be trying to communicate about.

about is, are we trying to be stimulative, or are we So in January, the Committee said that they were expecting to keep rates low, rates low through late 2014.  Did that mean the that mean the a new year and we've got a new clear about Rather than thresholds right or the right numbers to put in, I think that trying to get One of the things we should be clear trying to forecast? that conditions would warrant keeping Committee thought, boy, the recovery is much worse than we thought?  Or did Committee-now that January is the first meeting of composition of the Committee-has decided to be much more stimulative?  Being that is pretty important in terms of what you're trying to accomplish with policy. working on trying to get language to be clearer about what's stimulus and what's projection would be very useful.

I say, I'm a math guy.  So I like the idea of having something about reaction in terms of the scenario analysis that's done in done in the minutes-what's the benchmark of other scenarios-maybe three or four other things-are out there? The minutes I like.  It gives a little context, and it has the advantage of being voted on by the Committee.  And all the get to contribute, as we all have, their views about what the minutes should include. That said, as functions.  One way to think about this, maybe, is the Tealbook A, and something like this could be scenario?  What kinds How does the Committee think about responding to that? richer participants

March 13, 2012

going to respond to some benchmark scenarios and other ones. So I think there's a way to use the minutes to talk about our reaction function in terms of how we're talked through question 1.  Let me talk about question 2 at this point.  I think the flawed as a vehicle of communicating information about any aspect of policy. going to say it now, but I'll end up repeating some of not through surveys.  It's not a survey process of the views of the Committee members.  So I'm negative about I agree, but President George and about them-maybe we should wait.  But changes along the lines of as a false importance.  In contrast, in my memo last I described where we could make some wording changes to the SEP to be a little clearer not making forecasts.  We're each running our own optimal control I explain clearly to people what I explain it as follows:  I'm asked, if I was I am not likely to be policy.  [Laughter]  And when they realize this, the SEP has not as asking.  And we're all, I'm optimistic that my So I've SEP is structurally Governor Yellen said this better than I'm the things she said.  Monetary policy is being made by the Federal Open Market Committee operating as a collective, Committee participants, nor is it a survey of question 2.a.; questions 2.b. and 2.c. make some logical sense, President Pianalto have hit on some good things beyond that, I don't want the SEP to have any more importance than it already does.  I think it's already viewed as being too important by the public, and any further 2.b. and 2.c. will only inflate what I view week, about its content.  We're simulations using our own internal model.  I find that whenever is in the SEP, they don't take it as seriously anymore. in charge of monetary policy, what would I do?  Everyone recognizes that put in charge of monetary much content.  I think we should be clear that that's what we're actually of course, using our own model, not some kind of collective model.  So proposed clarifications in the memo will mitigate the risk of the public's making the mistake of treating the SEP as an instrument of policy.

March 13, 2012

Lockhart said this earlier, the evolution of dismissed as an impossibility because we have too many people around the table.  I'll a couple of things about that.  The first point sounds like something President Evans would Now let me turn to the final question, question 3.  President and I think if we talked about this, we would find that we would agree that policy should be explained in terms of the outlook-the outlook for utilization and the outlook for inflation.  I think that suggests that we have to find a way to build a consensus forecast.  This has been say say, but bear with me.

good here.  [Laughter] MR. EVANS.  I'm expecting something consensus forecast, as opposed to the is the SEP, might save 2,000 jobs-you can imagine that providing If you look at recent estimates of the the optimistic view is that jobs cost about $100,000 per job.  So saving 2,000 jobs is should be able to spend the time to get that right, and 2,000 jobs across MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  If we think that having a heterogeneous mess that more clarity about policy would be able to do that. stimulus, $200 million.  I think we the country is not that much.

I also think it's pretty feasible, so let me talk about why I say that.  If say to me, let's write a consensus statement about monetary policy with 17 people in anywhere, right?  How do we get around We achieve that consensus on our written statement by focusing our discussion on have been suggestions about using a median from the could have some kind of survey process that For Now, with that said, you were to the room, and let's start from scratch, you wouldn't get that problem? a rather limited array of choices, and I think the same would work with devising a consensus outlook.  So what do we focus on?  There SEP.  I think there is some validity to that.  We would start with that as some information gathering, but my basic idea is more to link forecasts to the statements.  At each FOMC meeting, the staff prepares three alternative statements.

March 13, 2012

append a near-term forecast for the relevant variables that's associated with those statements-basically a mathematical version of paragraph 1 of voting for an alternative is the same as voting for the associated monetary policy the information I think there are ways around this.  Basically, if you do an SEP maybe 10 days the Tealbook A kinds of forecasts out of FRB/US.  I do not think this is an any means.  Essentially, a forecast for the relevant variables has a relatively have to issue at each meeting. each statement, you could simply reasonably alternatives A, B and C.  Alternative A would typically be a weak outlook, B a middle outlook, and C a strong one.  When you voted for a statement, you'd be voting for the associated forecast, just as directive.  There are some logistical issues here about how to do this, how to get to the staff to allow them to do a good job on this-and Vice Chairman Dudley talked about this as well-but before the meeting, you can start to get the right kind of information to the staff.  You can combine that with impossibility by small number of dimensions compared with the words we communications.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So I think I've covered all the questions.  I think we should work toward a consensus forecast, and that would greatly improve our

I think Jim said it very well.  That is, everything has been challenged, and I have said shibboleths given globalization, efficient markets, which I don't believe in.  We heard law-how it's been challenged.  What is a NAIRU in a I like the simplicity of a rule, I think it's very hard to come up with.  We Governor Yellen using a corporate analogy.  What I learned in the corporate world you say; it's what you do.  You deliver or not, and you get into trouble when you I'm kind of a 'hard nut to crack' here because models drive the rule.  We live in a world where a lot of times publicly and privately that there are certain near cyberization, and so on:  the Phillips curve; a lot of discussion about Okun's globalized world?  There are all kinds of things that we really don't know and are struggling with.  So as much as started with is, it's not what say too much.

I'm initially averse to separating voting members from nonvoting members, but if want to emphasize voting members, fine, because and therefore seriously, would not differentiate between them because, as President exactly correctly, over time that value fades as nonvoting members will

formula, I'm in favor of 3.3-I think that's what it was-because those are the factors years that I've been here-I think it's years-and that is our long-term strategic goal.  We made it clear that we could notdual mandate-quantify, because of 'nonmonetary a specific unemployment rate, whereas we acknowledged that, for the most part, is a monetary phenomenon, and we stated a longer-term goal.  President Evans is ceiling, but it's our longer-term goal of 2 percent.

At Committee meetings about a bunch of states of the world, and waiting going to be easier-waiting until you know what June is going to look like.  So it's just bound to be hard. MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I said a bit about communication this morning, so I'll try to where you're just deciding on the funds rate, you just decide.  When you're looking forward and you're talking about the future, you're talking until you just have one to deal with is always next we publish it.  That's pretty to some extent, last interpretations of whether we were making a lesson I've learned just from today's that it would be useful to think through contingencies-have the staff help us think What if the data come in this way over the next couple Is it going to be graceful to turn it in this good one, Mr. Chairman.  Yes, for us to adopt President Williams's suggestion is a really thought through what a turn is going to look like.  I corollary-to do more than we can agree on, to the consensus statement.  We worked really hard, we left out stuff we we could agree on-a lowest-commonWe should understand collectively what we mean before simple, but it's easy to lose sight of, and I think we did that in January and, August.  I think we left the room with different commitment or not, and we need to sort that out.  A discussion is through, all right, what if this happens? of quarters?  How does this language evolve then? direction or that direction?  We've been focused on trying to make the language easier.  Your point was a turn in the other direction; we haven't don't think it's reasonable or practical-this is a say more than we can agree on.  And we did this with the exit strategy-we got a workable consensus-and then with couldn't agree on, and we included everything

I see here, in specificity, go beyond, a reasonable consensus here. denominator approach.  I think a lot of the alternatives theoretically, what would be part of want to say a word about commitment.  I've heard President Kocherlakota make some of the Committee to commit future I don't think a black-and-white view of that is correct.  I think we are responded to It was our experience in the were detrimental to our objectives in the very required tightening rates in order to fulfill that commitment.  So to ask the question; if we're going to commit there have to be incentives?  And I think the incentives are well in line there for going to be harder for us to live up to.  It's going to take longer to falsify or it, so I think that's going to be hard. I seemingly nihilistic statements about the inability Committees.  And committed.  We have been committed.  We have renewed the commitment made by Chairman Volcker to keep inflation low and stable.  We've renewed that every time we've mini inflation scares, and thankfully, we don't get many anymore. 1980s and 1990s to respond to those in ways that short run, to the extent that they I think President Kocherlakota is right-you have ourselves, don't us to live up to that implicit commitment, but complicated, contingent, reaction-function kinds of commitments are verify whether we're complying with

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  No, 2,000 jobs.

Is that, like, Fed watchers put out of workthat work?  We can talk about this offline.  But think about the third exhibit 1 that our Manager showed us this morning.  And it showed this little slope that have in mind that the unemployment rate that's going to trigger an exit differs you asked them the questions about our reaction generally right-that if growth picks up, going to exit earlier, and if growth is slow, we're going to exit later.  The understanding of good, is pretty close to what we can agree with.  I think and what the public understands is the unemployment rate as a threshold or are a lot of policy rules and models where the right thing to do is to respond to you know, the core of all the models we use is this growth model where you could put GDP growth at 4 percent or something in there equally as plausibly. model we ought to be that we're going to very much further.  A simple qualitative characterization, like 3.3, is, I words 'resource slack' is going to are going to be differences of views about whether that's a reasonable thing.  I MR. LACKER.  Two thousand jobs? [laughter]-or how does chart in primary dealers depending on the inflation rate.  I think if function, qualitatively market participants would get it we're the public and financial markets is pretty the distance between what we can manage to agree on here minimal.  So, look at an example.  A lot of these have trigger, but there economic growth.  As the real rate depends on the growth rate, not the level of some resource utilization.  So there's an argument that And I agree with President Bullard-there's enough uncertainty about the using, or the policy reaction function that best corresponds to optimal policy, have a hard time getting think, all we ought to aspire to.  But even then, the use of the divide us.  There

But I think we've a lot, and a great legacy has been left from what we've done now.  We need to wrestle Let me just close by pointing out what we've accomplished in the last conferences, the exit strategy statement, the consensus statement.  The exit strategy statement was designed to achieve way.  It was designed to say, 'Hey, we've '2013' language-maybe things are worse than we think, or we're more dovish than you're going to think.  It was designed to convey one of those two.  It yield curve, and I think it's done that.  The Vice Chairman is right about that. I think we should be looking for President Williams and his family-maybe achieved with what we've got.  I don't think we fully understand what we have.  That's the lesson from this morning.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  President Kocherlakota.

I have to defend myself against the charge of being a nihilist. I used the word 'commitment' overly broadly, President Lacker.  I was only a relatively higher-than-target rate of inflation along with MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. [Laughter] referring to the specific issue of commitment-a lot of the policies that would be beneficial in the current environment involve having a low rate of unemployment in the later part of the decade.

LACKER.  Right. MR.

I was questioning as being MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  And that's the kind of commitment difficult to carry out.

March 13, 2012

LACKER. If I could respond, Mr. Chairman-the way I'd put it is, that's a MR. commitment that you'd question the credibility of.  You'd question the credibility of that commitment.

with Lacker.  For the life of me, I'm having a hard time figuring out what problem it is The first thing-is there some agreement we've reached that we we haven't?  I just don't sense that there's that a level of confusion in the marketplace that would go to the same panel 3 that President heard us.  The new MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think I'm going to largely agree President we're actually trying to solve. think we need to communicate to the public that level of agreement out there that we need, in the interest of transparency, to communicate.  And then the second thing is, I don't see that there's necessitates us communicating something.  And I Lacker referenced in Brian's presentation.  It looks to me as though the market understands there's a tradeoff between unemployment and inflation rates.  And when we published what we published, they moved down their expectations, but it seems to me that they line, the March 2012 line, doesn't look terribly different than what's attempted to be described in a lot of these attachments.

you go to panel 2, which is the distribution of the first increase in the It tells me when a group of dealers think that an idea of what the move has been over the last intermeeting going to give about the participants on this Furthermore, if target fed funds rate, it gives me some information. liftoff would be.  And it gives me period.  That's the same information we're

March 13, 2012

and, two, what the Committee has actually done over time.  And then, finally, most I going to get and when?  Borrowers want to know, how much interest am I going to and when?  And investors want to know, what are my assets going to be worth and when? the date is to many of you, it works for them.  They can understand it. Committee.  So I think that's doing something.  I think the way market participants come to that is that they formed opinions about what the Committee is likely to do based on two things-one, what we say; of the public doesn't care how we're making these decisions.  Savers want to know, how much interest am pay And as unsatisfactory as So I have a tough time.

gives us additional points of disagreement, additional reasons for someone to and not find a way to support it.  It also gives an opportunity for those from the consensus statement that we did all agree to and I with the fed funds paths in the alternative simulations, which are based on the Committee and a lot of information, if I assume that previous from that is a reasonable thing for me to agree to. To go to the specific questions, I think anything that includes two new data points, two new numbers, just dissent from the statement two new numbers to be different publish.  It doesn't weight the variations, and it is different from history, because every time compare this historical actions of the Committees made reasonable decisions, then it's hard for me to assume that something that's different really cares about is, what does the Chairman project?  Once they know what the goes way down.  And it is a threecommitting some theoretical future Committee and committing the person In terms of clarifying who projected what in the SEP-again, I think the only thing anybody Chairman projects, their interest in what the rest of us project year horizon, and everybody will vote within that three-year horizon.  So to me, there's a difference between

March 13, 2012

I think that is a difference. who will actually vote on the decision in two years when they're sitting right next to me and they've said that they don't like it.  So for any future easing-for QE3-which is I think there's a lot of misunderstanding about, a lot of desire for information about, and round-which is, what is the threshold and the increment for us moving Lastly, these discussions have all been about, again, when and how we exit.  There's been no discussion about how we communicate thresholds what that's something that it would be fruitful to talk about.  And then the second question we discussed in the policy the date that we have in our statement today?-we need to think about that carefully.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

you have to leave, CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher, whenever please feel free.

Narayana makes excellent points about the degree to would be, misunderstood outside the would add to that my own uneasiness with the specific indicators that for what it is, which is a somewhat discrete, though significant, issue that is a a zero interest rate period during which we are trying to use communication to more-conventional movements in the federal funds rate and, on that adjust, as necessary, actually means.  And there may come a point at which we'd not a model that would actually be used in normal times, but instead is specific to the circumstances that we face right now. which the use of quantitative triggers can be, and probably confines of this room.  I are reflected in the draft paragraphs.  So I think on this one, my current preference would be to treat the date issue byproduct of substitute to some degree for ad hoc basis, to primarily use the Chairman's press conferences to expectations around what that date want to change the date.

think this is really 2 and 3-the point that Janet made at the you have echoed, is critical.  Sometimes it doesn't seem this way to me I walk in here-that this is a collective decisionmaking process, as opposed to people going to do.  But this is a collective process in meant we didn't have a chance adequately to take into account the committee, both its size and the peculiarity of of thinking about how to give more focus to the relate to the collective decision.  But I against trying to do that in April or June.  It's a bit of a muddle out there, I don't think it's a horrible muddle, and I don't think it's creating big problems.  So it seems want to wait a while, see how people's On the SEP itself-and I outset, and a number of when coming in already knowing exactly what they're the sense that it's a Committee and it requires a vote.  And I do think that the way in which the SEP has been put in place idiosyncrasies of our particular monetary policy nonregular voting members.  I would be in favor projections so as to make it a little bit more clear how they would really counsel but to me that this is a case in which we might actually

some guidance by the Chairman in his press conferencesyear have the subcommittee-whatever Janet's group we may want to make in light of a year's worth of of one or two releases' worth of experience with it. perceptions of the projections-with evolve over time, and then maybe next is-think about what kinds of changes experience rather than fear that it would be tough-I hope we would at least maybe give a little bit of focus, in turn, to the projections.  On the voteran argument for the proposition that the person who is year and a half from now is actually more important than the person voting I actually find myself only a first, and fully considered, thought.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Boy, Narayana is heroic in thinking consensus is possible.  And if that were right, I think that would be optimal.  If it's not-and I think about the alternative scenarios approach to focus people on particular specific circumstances and then nonvoter issue, it seems to me there's going to be voting a now with respect to the language that's in there.  So I think it's actually important for the public to understand who is in what camp, but that's not always the case. favoring the full matrix with identification of individuals, but that's really probably not

In particular, the expansion of the postmeeting statement, along with we pay to the words in it, now provides the public with much more postmeeting statement has been enhanced with I believe in quantity over that while the longer postmeeting statement MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'll first provide a seems to me worthwhile the economic outlook and the Committee's monetary policy decisions.  And on this front, I think we've made the careful attention that information than before.  This 'build-out' of the press conferences, minutes, and the SEP.  And I say this not because quality, or transparency over clarity.  It strikes me

March 13, 2012

communicated.  Phrases and changes are discussed extensively, and this is words matter.  I also imagine that at some point in time, we would being unnecessary and we would delete it.  At the same time, we've I've always viewed this as one step in certainly provides more information, we have been thoughtful and methodical about the quality of what's being appropriate because our contemplate language as provided the public with a lot of new information regarding participants' projections.  And this, too, strikes me as the right step, although I have to say that a multistep process.

between the economic outlook and formulation of projections at the individual this was the transparency.  However, once the still doesn't know how the components reshaped at the Committee level and result in policy decisions.  In other words, do they clarity?  They don't see, for example, how the individual economic outlooks, to contract or expand or stay put, depend on the Committee's view of guidance, the public is left with speculation and uncertainty.  And which of the That should not be the objective.  I I'm not sure the public is certainty about the economic factors that we believe, as To assist the public in understanding the linkages monetary policy decisions, we started with a participant level.  And this was the first step; individual components are understood, the public became not have perfect particularly in the choice how the decisions to contract, expand, or stay put relate to particular economic conditions and assumptions.  Without clear I'll say that the speculation and uncertainty don't derive from not knowing individual dots on the chart drive the Committee's actions. don't think we're trying to individualize members on the Committee. served by knowing who dot A is and who dot B is.  Rather, the speculation arises from the public not knowing what our reaction function is.  So in my view, we should be striving to enhance understanding of what the public should look for in the economy come late 2014.  This, to me, would encourage a reasonable degree of

March 13, 2012

current sense is that there's no consensus on what this reaction function looks like, and are meant to convey that this vacuum adds to uncertainties, whicha Committee, are relevant to the choice in a date of contraction or expansion or staying put. Now, my these comments really theoretically, at least-could otherwise be minimized.

comment briefly on questions 2 and 3.  First of all, about further adjustments to the argument that we have been withholding that which we decided not to I think that for many in the public, this is the with this view, because of this distinction between clarity.  And my sense is that we are proceeding in a responsible, deliberate, I do, though, want to mention this because these efforts that from what some in the public recommendation that I have for managing the of the pace and structure of disclosure is to I'll SEP-yes, I think further adjustments would be helpful.  There is much room for improvement in the SEP, and I would prefer, though, to continuously evaluate options for clarification of the SEP, if possible, in one fell swoop rather than as a kind of drip, drip, incremental process that could give the public the provide in the prior SEP.  The third question, about other potential approaches for clarifying, really brings back, again, this distinction between transparency and clarity.  And it reminds me that there is an elephant in the room here, and that's the call by many in the public to disclose, with a shorter lag, the transcripts of these meetings. ultimate transparency option.  The true definition of a reaction function consists of the dynamics that exist here.  Many people in the public would argue that anything we do short of that falls short of true transparency.  Now, I don't agree transparency and thoughtful manner, and throwing the transcripts out earlier may provide transparency but, certainly, will not provide clarity. we're undergoing still represent, I think, a big disconnect understand to be complete transparency.  So one public debate and communication to keep control consider a shift in the rhetoric that we use from one about transparency to one about clarity.

March 13, 2012

and for a very good conversation.  I particularly want to commend the Committee on I thought I said, we weren't going to come to any decisions today-[laughter]-and I can accurately summarize the whole discussion, but let me make a for a while to give the public time to digest all of the steps we've taken, et That's fine in principle, but as today's discussion suggested, we do have the issue of say 'we' in this case now, but I think the staff, with whether it's a longer statement or whether it's a more fulsome description of what it is the date means and what we about as we look at it.  That's one observation.  There were other interesting report-or I guess it's called-to see what we might learn from that.  Of course, we already do two each year.  There's a lot of staff effort invested there. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, all, for bearing with a long day the interactive nature of this discussion.  There was an awful lot of back-and-forth that was very helpful.  As I don't really think that couple of comments.  First, there were a number of people who expressed a desire to let things sit and percolate cetera. what to do about the current form of the statement.  And we'll have the same issue next meeting. So, if nothing else, we should at least-and I some further outreach-think about some kind of improvement in our broader communication strategy, whether it's the press conference or something that just gives might be thinking suggestions about looking at, say, the Bank of England's monetary policy Inflation Report, Monetary Policy Report s to the Congress It seems to me that we might conceivably end up reallocating that effort to four shorter reports, for example, that would be more useful to the public than what we have now.

are some directions, and again, we'll look through the transcripts of can pull out.  For example, there were a number of people a good So I think that those this discussion to see what else we who had comments on the scenarios option, maybe using the minutes.  There was

March 13, 2012

are various things at, and again, I very much appreciate the discussion. discussion of whether more disclosure in the SEP would be useful.  So there that we can look want to mention one other thing, which is that one question that has gap projections.  And I've asked Governor Yellen FOMC meeting schedule for next fifth SEP or moving around the meetings-perhaps going to have some discussion of that, but clearly we have to come to some resolution we do need to set the meeting schedule for next year.  If anyone has thoughts or on this general subject, perhaps you can be in touch with Governor Yellen.  [Laughter] further questions or comments?  President Lacker. Before closing, I been raised about our SEP is the fact that between June and November, there's a very long between what should be, in some sense, quarterly and her subcommittee to look at this.  We need to look at it.  We need to make some decisions soon about this because, of course, we have to prepare our year.  But possible options might be adding a even having seven meetings that are two days.  There are various options that we could look at. And we're soon because views Any

about today's statement, about '2014,' the issue I interpreted the view that having made the statement raises the bar for as that it represents some commitment.  That contradicts what you've said in public about I take the status quo to be that it's a forecast.  Can I assume that it remains adoptMR. LACKER.  Earlier in the meeting of commitment came up. action it being a forecast. that way until we formally

I think one I misunderstood your question originally-was, commitment?  There may be some people in the public who say, CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I asked for discussion of that point today. thing that I was trying to convey-and maybe was this an unconditional 'Well, the Fed says they're not changing rates until late 2014-unconditionally.'

MR. LACKER.  Right.

March 13, 2012

I was very clear that that is certainly not what we're Taylor rule or an attempt at an optimal policy yet fully resolved. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  And doing, that this is conditional on the factors that we discuss in the statement.  However, I don't think this Committee has really thoroughly hashed out whether or not the reaction function that is embedded in that conditional commitment is a under commitment or what.  And I think that question is not

MR. LACKER.  Okay.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you, all.  The next meeting will be Tuesday and Wednesday, April 24 and 25.
