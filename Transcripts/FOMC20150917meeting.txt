some market rates since earlier this year, as shown in the top-left panel of your third the month of August, excluding month-end, reached 14 basis points, its level in over two years.

This trend continued over the period, and the average effective federal funds rate for highest in the effective rate over including the pull of higher secured money market rates.

Responses to the Desk's surveys and outreach to a wide range of counterparties, summarized in your participants view term interest rates following liftoff.  Specifically, the modal expectation is that effective rate will print only slightly below the target range, and this expectation has been stable in responses to the Desk's surveys for some time. expected recent months.

that the timing of liftoff relative to ceiling might also affect the path of money market rates.

Demand for RRPs could be further boosted if, the ON RRP aggregate $300 billion limit. More recently, market participants have noted the debt intermeeting period, Treasury Secretary Lew extended the debt issuance suspension period through October extraordinary securities.  Staff and Treasury debt that is subject to the around late bottom-right panel, suggest that bill supply could temporarily decline another $171 billion reduction in supply could put downward pressure on money for outstanding bills, and the potential combination of lower money market rates and reduced bill operations, particularly as in the past, money funds seek to avoid so-called at-risk securities or increase their investments in short-term, cash-like instruments in anticipation of possible redemptions.  These pressures could increase the risk that demand at operations exceeds the current

As in previous episodes, the staff intends to prepare contingency plans for a variety of scenarios and will provide an update to the Committee at the October meeting or sooner, if needed.

sent to the Committee during the panel, the Desk plans to offer term quarter-end.  Should the Committee decide not to increase range, the Desk would propose offering $250 billion in term RRPs at two quarter-end dates but below the $300 billion offered in December 2014. Looking ahead, as detailed in a note intermeeting period and outlined in the top-right RRPs over the September the target 3 basis points over the ON RRP offered rate, apportioned between seven- and twoday maturities.  This increased offering amount should mitigate, to some extent, the risk that a drop in Treasury bill supply might lead to more quarter-end pressure than we anticipate.

MR. POTTER.  It's from both the dealer survey and the Survey of Market Participants.

2014, inflation was above 2 percent.  Is that because they thought we would be late to liftoff?  We hadn't finished the tapering, and now should I infer that to liftoff or right about time for liftoff?  Also, is there any information from this longer-term inflation expectations might be moving?  I understand that it's short term, MR. EVANS.  Okay.  It seems to show that in June and July of expected to be were taking a while to taper and we we're early about how but any information about credibility anchors?

look into the heads of the people who put this answer down. MR. POTTER.  I can't other things. MR. EVANS.  But you do statistical analysis of

the probability distributions we have collected over the past year to a year the higher inflation outcomes, so that naturally that people expect.  In terms of the probability that to two years ahead, the dealers think there's a 30 not as high as they thought in March.  The buy side places a slightly with the subdued inflation outlook. MR. POTTER.  We do, but not psychology, which I'm not so good at.  What has been the case, if you look at and a half, there's less probability assigned to drags down the average inflation rate inflation will be less than 1.75 percent over one percent chance, which is higher probability on that outcome than they did in March.  If you average the dealers and buy side together, you get about 45 percent probability, and that's consistent inflation we've seen and the current

MR. POTTER.  They're both going up, but by less.

This is the one-year forward rate, so you have to be careful with it.  And happened yesterday.  If you look at the two-year note, it was 80 basis And you did see swap spreads also fall again yesterday. MR. WILLIAMS.  Yes, but they're actually both coming down, on net, over the period. MR. POTTER. it's not updated for what points at close yesterday.

the swap rates have fallen? MR. WILLIAMS.  Okay.  So, first,

Yes. MR. POTTER.

WILLIAMS. And the second question is, do we have a view on what is more in the economy, and mortgage rates-is it swap rates or the Treasury rates? can have special features that mean that there's a special premium associated are more correlated with the private borrowing rates that we MR. correlated with the interest rates we think matter for borrowing, like corporate rates, other borrowing rates Treasury securities with those, and possibly swap rates probably think actually matter-that is my question.

It's definitely true that this could be taken as something the private sector if they want to swap floating for fixed.  Overall, though, if you look at high yield still not a really big change.  I've got 14 over the intermeeting period, which we quoted as being at the 31st percentile.  One was 128 basis points, which occurred with the fall in oil prices and MR.

WILLIAMS. Are other borrowing rates besides mortgage rates, like corporate bond MR. rates- higher, and that's the past few months.  But as Lorie emphasized, absolutely zero evidence of signs of stress in funding markets.  Again, as I said, it's a maybe we'll learn there's a great index that would've told us what to do in a MR.

My question is for Lorie, and it's concerning the challenges of start raising rates.  It's a two-part activity in the reverse end of August and the beginning of September?  And as you think about in terms of thinking challenges to actually doing liftoff when we want to lift off?  Are there things that actually be able to lift off effectively when we want to? MR. ROSENGREN. implementing the reverse repo facility when we decide to question.  One is from panel 15.  Were you surprised there wasn't more repo facility around the the volatility we've been experiencing in financial markets-the debt ceiling, the government shutdown, and end-of-the-year effects-how do you weigh those things about the particularly concern you as we think about October, December, or next year and what's going to be happening, whether we'll markets and flight to quality.  We didn't see any funding the type of volatility we'd expect to affect RRP would be more closely connected to funding pressures than asset price going longer out.  So I wasn't particularly surprised, but we were monitoring it closely MS. LOGAN.  With respect to the first question on not seeing more usage, I guess you're referring to the financial volatility in pressures, as Simon just discussed.  I would think that the overnight volatility to be sure.

debt ceiling, given that the Committee is considering liftoff, I don't think we would expect to see year-end issues associated there would be plenty of room to accommodate year-end targeting the overnight rate.  There are other issues associated with liquidity in in broader asset prices just because as much trading going on during that time of year.  So I think there are two separate liftoff at the end of the year.  One is related specifically to think the cap should go a long way toward alleviating that if it was lifted. With respect to the year-end and the suspending the cap at with managing the rate because pressures while financial markets- there might be an exaggerated move there's not issues when you look at implementation, and I

September 16-17, 2015

other is just broader financial market volatility, and I think that one is harder to assess, but I liquidity at year-end. The would say that there's a lot less ceiling, I think it can go both ways.  One the one hand, with the to be more pressure to use the overnight RRP know when that really is going to markets are going to treat the at-risk securities.  If market think the ON RRP facility is going to be there, they may not withdraw from the give them those at-risk securities, and so we might not see the pressures I think it's hard to know with respect to the debt ceiling. With respect to the debt reduction in bill supply, we should expect there due to a shortage of collateral.  On the other hand, we don't start, and we also don't know how participants money funds that might there.

In our briefing, Chris and I will provide evidence on discuss possible implications for the reinvestment language options C of the September Tealbook. At the July FOMC to end reinvestment, including the appropriate economic conditionality of such a decision and the macroeconomic effects of alternative strategies.  In recently received a follow-up memo that addressed a number of these questions.

Of note, although we the trigger strategies are geared toward specific be communicated through continue until the federal funds rate reaches the trigger-either 1 percent-and then stop permanently.  These strategies have several key features. First, Principles and Plans document, which indicates reinvestment will depend on the economic outlook.

The larger balance sheet under each trigger strategy causes the term premium-panel B-to run a Because the simulations does not raise policy rates enough to counteract sheet stimulus, long-term real interest rates decline a touch baseline-panel C-and, consequently, the unemployment rate also falls a little more quickly-panel E.  However, it even under results and wonder if reinvestment policy could matter macroeconomic outcomes.  Returning to the top of the exhibit, consider a its current level for a very in panel B-and the unemployment rate, panel E, falls reinvestment policy can have sizable effects, albeit under an extreme strategy. You might look at the much for polar case-shown by the green dash-dotted lines in panel A-in which the FOMC announces that the SOMA portfolio will be held constant at long time.  In this case, the term premium drops about 40 basis points on the announcement-the green line about ยผ percentage point below baseline by 2018.  This example highlights the result that

This outcome is illustrated by the strategy labeled 'liftoff plus 2 years' shown by the dashed blue lines in panel C.  It delays the end of reinvestment by two years after liftoff, to late 2017, and thus extends the SOMA holdings.  Because the effects on the term premiumpanel D-are quite unemployment, the blue lines

A strategy that would restart reinvestment in response to sufficiently bad shocks could potentially do better in limiting macroeconomic effects than strategy were well understood by market participants.  Of course, the greater state dependence when to cease or begin phasing out As noted in your final exhibit, paragraph 4 of alternative C provides two options to characterize the Committee's thinking about reinvestments.  The first is to continue reinvesting 'until normalization of the level of

is well under way,' and the second is to continue reinvesting 'at the federal funds rate least during the early stages of normalization of the level of the federal funds rate.'

might view 'well under way' as qualitatively consistent with the trigger the memo.  In particular, market participants might interpret reinvestment would not cease until economic increase the target range for the federal funds the economic outlook deteriorated, reinvestment could continue for a long time. federal to trigger an end of reinvestment, although You strategies discussed in this language as suggesting that conditions had led the Committee to rate more than a few times.  In addition, the public might conclude that, in the event that This qualitative language would leave some ambiguity about how high the funds rate would have to rise policymakers could help clarify the public's understanding through speeches, testimony, and other communications.

'at least during the early stages' might be interpreted as indicating the Committee intends to cease or phase out reinvestment after a few hikes in the rate even if the federal funds rate stayed relatively low thereafter.  Market would probably view this language as indicating that policymakers place was to stubbornly low. In contrast, that policy participants a relatively high priority on beginning to normalize the size of the balance sheet fairly soon.  However, the qualification 'at least' would likely suggest that the Committee wanted to retain some option to continue reinvestments if the labor market weaken or if inflation was will be happy to take your questions.

Why use the term 'well under trigger strategies potentially can be communicated in the Committee preferred qualitative guidance about sheet, so we wanted to avoid really making it seem that the triggers we provide in MR. ERCEG.  I think that the different ways.  The minutes suggested that the balance our quantitative exercises for concreteness purposes really should be treated as numerical triggers as such.

MR. ERCEG.  I just wanted to add that it might be helpful to think of the policy as essentially affecting what we From that perspective, balance sheet in essence be tantamount to raising the natural real rate.  And that's essentially what's happening in these exercises, and it federal funds rate model.  It's taken from the Li and model, which is estimated over the 1994 to 2007 pre-crisis sample period.  It's consistent persistent effects on term premiums associated with very protracted Now, of course, this effect is derived from an estimated Wei with relatively large and changes in the level of long-term assets on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.  So that drives

I think of this kind of policy terms of the composition of assets that are in the hands of the composition of the assets of the public lowers the term premium below what it would be otherwise in a a given particular time path of public debt issuance by the Treasury.

last time, that in principle, a the funds rate path should be capable of completely and exactly offsetting the effect of different balance sheet path.  So I'm surprised at these little differences in C and D-why funds rate path for the constant portfolio result in the same unemployment and rates as the baseline case?  Why didn't you nail it in C and D?  And, second, the a lot, as shown in A-for example, look at the percent.  How come, in 10 years, it, and why is the funds MR. LACKER.  I'm looking at exhibit 3.  We discussed this change in a doesn't the inflation intercept term in the inertial Taylor rule changes constant portfolio case-10 years from now, it's still above 2 the difference in the funds rate paths between the constant portfolio and the baseline case isn't closer to the difference in the intercept terms?  So why didn't you nail rate not that much different at the end?

In other words, reducing the probability of returning to the that we're really talking about here. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

I'm fine with is well under way,' but I we think that the normalization is expected to sustainable.' In terms of the language the phrase 'until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate think we should add an additional condition that prove sustainable or something similar.  Paragraph 5 in alternative C might read something like 'The Committee anticipates doing so until the normalization of the level of funds rate is well under way and is expected to prove

September 16-17, 2015

that the end of reinvestment should not be tied level of the funds rate but also tied to the economic outlook.  I could imagine a relatively low federal funds rate if the economy was to grow very rapidly over the following year with very few downside risks in terms of the effective I'd favor waiting to end reinvestments if the of returning to the effective lower bound would be higher in that case. The notion I have in mind here is mechanically to the supporting an early end of reinvestment at forecast the economic outlook.  In that case, the likelihood would be that the Committee would raise federal funds rate further over the next year, and the probability of an early return to the lower bound would be very low.  In contrast, economy was lacking forward momentum even at a somewhat higher federal funds rate.  That's because the risk we're delaying reinvestment for a reason-to reduce effective lower bound.  That should really be the parameter of the federal funds time.  We want to end reinvestments when that I think you have to get the concept of the outlook in there as well. The point I'm trying to make is that the probability of returning to the that we're focusing on.  That probability is not just governed by the level rate, but also the economic outlook at the probability is relatively low, and I think that's not sufficiently summed up just by 'well advanced.'

September 16-17, 2015

memo, making decisions about the appropriate size of the balance think it's very important that we weigh both the costs and the benefits under a wide range plausible scenarios.  The memo emphasized one specific adverse scenario in order to illustrate in the years beyond the baseline, and the larger resulting balance sheet of ending reinvestments on a preset path. In terms of the staff sheet, I of a potential benefit of using a state-dependent rule for any reinvestments.  As was described memo and in the presentation, in this particular scenario, a state-dependent rule continues reinvestment for several provides additional stimulus relative to the case and benefits of maintaining a very large balance sheet. extreme, we should always maintain a very arguably even larger than what we have today, to provide insurance against SOMA portfolio lowers a higher equilibrium point higher than baseline for the constant portfolio. the federal funds rate as a policy But in considering the merits of such a state-dependent rule, we shouldn't lose sight of the bigger issue of the relative costs Indeed, taking the analysis of the memo to its logical large balance sheet, negative shocks.  Now, I'm picking up on something implied by Vice Chairman Dudley's comment because, according to the Board analysis we discussed, a large the term premium and effectively shifts the IS curve out, and this implies federal funds rate-it's about ยฝ percentage What does that do?  It provides us with more buffer to use instrument to respond to negative shocks.

scenario or about the strategy for ending low equilibrium real interest rate?  In a way, I think language concerning how we would the costs around that because the I see this memo not really being about this reinvestments.  Really, it's a question of, fundamentally, do we need a bigger buffer, especially in light of concerns about a continuing very the memo narrows the question too much to just the specific end reinvestments, and we really should think much more carefully about both the benefits more generally of having a large balance sheet, and also revisit

September 16-17, 2015

benefits.  Now, we've decided through our discussions in the sheet outweigh the benefits at most times, and track of that in thinking through some of these issues in terms of the certain scenarios. memo obviously can only cover the past that the costs of holding a very large balance we shouldn't lose reinvestment strategy, as opposed to just focusing on the benefits under am veering into the topic of the long-run policy strategy that the Chair initiated and is under way, but I do think this is an important issue to think about.  If we are worried about the equilibrium real interest rate, and are these tradeoffs that we're facing? Now, I recognize I has really do think we're in a world of a lower equilibrium real rate and we downside risks, I think we really should be thinking in very broad terms about what the costs and benefits of the balance sheet are.  And getting back to President Bullard's question, what do we really understand about the effects of the balance sheet on what

think that the memo is fine-I have no quibbles about the memo-but it narrows this broader issue and benefits of the balance sheet and not just thinking through this one experiment I discussion down far too much.  The discussion we need to be having is about this of the costs because, more generally, in a stochastic environment, we're going to get hit by both positive and negative shocks.

the long-run policy initiative, but I do hope that this is one of the issues on which they give us than later.  Thank you. Again, I'm looking forward to the work that's being started in the work group with regard to better guidance, and sooner rather

September 16-17, 2015

And what this analysis has brought out has been that, essentially, in the easing that has is in the balance sheet-it's there and it's having an effect.  Let me ask the next tell you the effect. the balance sheet? 'stock' view of what it is that quantitative easing does, all of the quantitative been done so far question and then I'll rate remains unchanged.  Well, what happens Our analysis is that quantitative easing goes into the term premium.  We put into the system goes into longer-term assets and reduces When we do quantitative easing, the short to other interest rates? buy up assets, and the money that's the term premium.

question is, what do we want to do over the longer term, after we've we had already reduced the balance sheet to its steady-state have a lower federal funds rate.  At some point, we might even reach the point at a near-zero federal funds rate again.  What the large balance sheet is doing effective lower bound, as both Vice Chairman Dudley and Williams pointed out, and it's providing us with a twist in the term structure which we a factor encouraging investment.  And the question is: Do we want to keep this effect of having a higher federal funds rate and So the next normalized the federal funds rate?  If level, we might which we would be at for us is keeping us away from the President probably like.  We haven't really seen the effects of quantitative easing show up in investment spending very much, but, in principle, it is What do we want to do? a lower longer-term rate?

don't like what we'd have to do if we got back down to zero, and it will be and so forth.  So it's useful to have this 'stock of QE' under our control. reduce it at some time by stopping reinvestment, and we could in effect reduce the stock We'd like the possibility of keeping the federal funds rate positive for longer, I assume, because we politically controversial We can

Simon, I must get a different set of that's what I find in the analyst remarks that I read-six I conclude that we ought to rethink and keep reinvestment going a little a slight problem in the fact that when you read what people say, they all assume it's six months after normalization begins analyst remarks from that you get, but months, nine months-and I think we might want to go longer.

I also want to thank the staff actually thought it was account everything, so for my purposes, this our normalization principles, and unless we're rethinking those, because we want to get the balance sheet say.  And I found the memo actually helpful in My view is that we have at some point we're going to have to end reinvestments back down to what the normalization principles thinking about that.  To my mind, I didn't see that much difference in either the adverse scenario

September 16-17, 2015

the 1 percent trigger or the 2 percent trigger.  I like the fact that the end of reinvestments to the funds rate because we're using the same economic state-contingent strategy. or the normal scenarios with we're tying conditions.  It's a allow for us to start up reinvesting to end reinvestments when the trigger is 1 percent, and then if need be-if baseline scenario-we can always start reinvesting again. how we the decision at some point, and I think that's what my The one thing the memo did for simplicity is not again.  I would prefer things turn out to be worse than our This is a simple memo because, by necessity, it should be to be clear, but in terms of approach policy, we could reverse preference would be, because at some point we're going to have to end reinvestments.

address is when the Committee with more concrete information, and I think that's really a Simon and the Desk-how much advance notification do market participants need our strategy is going to be?  If we can agree on a strategy and if you come back and there are benefits to being clear, we might want to be more explicit in the liftoff statement our strategy is, including putting in, if we agree on a trigger, what that trigger is. Concerning the language, the one issue the memo didn't would want to provide the public question for about what say about what normalization is further along' that would be in between the on the table for alternative C.  But I think it's a question really for the Desk about much advance notification market participants need to prepare for the end of reinvestments. If you think that we don't really need to be that explicit in qualitative language, perhaps you could say something like 'when two choices how Thank you.

In reality, the much monetary accommodation to provide based on macroeconomic is illustrated in the memo. Overall, I want to think of the FOMC as just choosing the That's maybe just channels-either through the federal funds rate or through a first set of simulations, Committee chooses how circumstances.  So the effects of a particular reinvestment strategy of the type outlined in the memo could be completely offset by an appropriate choice of the federal funds rate path, as has been discussed in the previous comments.  This the Committee thinks.  And surely we want that deliberation to go on, and we want the right level of accommodation at a particular point in time.  So constructed in the memo.  And as far as our policy the baseline strategy of ending reinvestments six the Committee choose the federal funds rate path it judges provides the appropriate level of accommodation. So what's the meaning of different reinvestment strategies and probably different levels of accommodation?  We want to leave it up to the Committee to change policy based on whatever Committee to be looking at the I'm not sure it's a useful exercise, the way it's is concerned, I think we might as well stick to months after liftoff, and then go ahead and let that

September 16-17, 2015

similar conclusion can be drawn.  In this scenario, the economy is forced back to the Committee can simply choose the appropriate appropriate level of the balance sheet-that is, the right could get exactly the right level of have to rely on the approximate amount offered by the trigger strategy. exercise of having the trigger strategy, and then that's going to give the right level of what the trigger strategy is going to do over the forecast In the second exercise in the memo-reinvestment strategies under the adverse scenario-a zero lower bound in 2017 for three years.  A trigger-type reinvestment strategy could provide accommodation in this scenario, but of course the level of accommodation by choosing the presumably by reinstituting QE.  I know you're swearing off QE, but if you get in circumstance, you're going to use the tool again.  The FOMC accommodation and not So why are we going through this elaborate we're going to adjust our path of the funds rate accommodation, taking into account horizon?

If we get on the road to thinking through a in which we've got a big buffer stock, that will be the third normalization strategy for us past three years-we had one last year and one a couple of years before that. MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I strongly agree comments about this.

I think a 'global' approaches needs

I liked the more in the camp of wanting to end early, as I was at the July meeting.  But these are As for language, I was uncomfortable with 'well under after we raise rates.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota. CHAIR

Chair.  It's been a very rich discussion the July meeting when it became apparent Mester suggested.  I think this lack of reversibility is pretty crucial in terms of how we the matter President Williams If, as President Bullard and President Mester suggested, we'll just turn on this tool when the effective lower bound and we need more accommodation, we'll again, then I think it's a very different economy-assuming that those costs are coming from the political economy considerations that President in maintaining a large balance sheet.  These are very, MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam already.  I have to admit that I was pretty surprised at that more than a few FOMC participants viewed halting reinvestments as being a decision that would be very costly to reverse by reinitiating purchases or by beginning reinvestments again, as President think about the appropriate long-run size of the balance sheet, raised. we need it and, if we hit begin reinvestments again or we'll begin active purchases question than if we view halting reinvestments as having enormous costs associated with it.  And then we have to weigh the political political economy considerations-against Lacker pointed to, which are also very real very challenging issues.

way the memo drafted the what I heard at the July meeting, I am very sympathetic to that way of the memo-this irreversibility leads to worse economic outcomes if we have to return to meeting, to me this means we should only be to halt reinvestments at a point in time when we're willing to increase the effective lower rates.  Basically, halting reinvestments is taking a tool away from yourself. away another tool, which on interest rates. If we take as given this lack of reversibility-and that's the problem and, in light of drafting the effective lower bound.  As I argued at the July willing bound on interest You should only be willing to do that if you are actually willing to take is to increase the effective lower bound

September 16-17, 2015

long-run neutral real rate is going to be pretty loath to throw away these kinds of tools at this stage. this point would be to leave out any reference to reinvestment policy at the My own thinking is, in light of where I think the and given our recent experience, I'm My preference at time of liftoff.

learning that's going the tent' kind of thinking that we all have about this, and I think that's good.  I think is going to work before starting to talk thing that we aren't sure how it is going to work is wise counsel. I thought President Kaplan raised some great points, too, about the to occur.  He hasn't been involved in these conversations before, so he hasn't gotten totally into the 'inside that having an opportunity to learn about how this process about a new of liftoff, the Chair could say that this matter remains under study by the staff allows us an opportunity to dovetail our thinking about reinvestments At the time and principals.  I think it with the longer-run operating framework exercise that the Chair initiated.

On the other hand, the larger than we thought it was three or four years ago-it might be larger than we think it is today.  I think this to engage in some serious conversations about that. One comment on the normalization principles.  The normalization principles certainly have indicated that the Committee likes having a smaller balance sheet. normalization principles have also said we want to keep as large a balance sheet as is necessary to be able to conduct effective monetary policy.  That could be a lot going to be Committee will have in the draft of alternative C.  If Committee members to the idea of tying reinvestments to something specific in the Now, assuming the Committee does want to make a reference to reinvestments, I'm concerned about the vagueness of what's can agree among themselves outlook, something specific regarding the federal funds rate, as was done in the memo, it would be really great to offer that kind of clarity.

I'm policy leaning that Bill memo, although not necessarily foursquare is the one I raised at the July meeting, which is about potential it is-is important.  As people probably don't recall, but I'll happen-which I don't expect to happen, but liftoff.  One could be a blowing-out of the ON My concern contingencies.  I think President Williams's caution-to be clear about costs as well as benefits of keeping the balance sheet where remind you, I raised a couple of things that might which might happen-in the early stages after RRP program beyond what we currently expect.  Another would be a flattening, or even inversion, of the yield curve.

In the interest of clear communication, if we're going to say we can find a way to put in an appropriate qualification that to understand that our default position is that we're going to let Stan said, but that if some dodgy things start happening in a somewhat different approach.  I don't have a formulation for going to be something like that, with that we always used to stick in-'in the context of price stability.'  We used to talk about message that if Under those circumstances, an earlier cessation of reinvestment might be among the more efficacious tools at our disposal. something in the statement, I hope allows the public and markets rates go up for a while for the reasons financial markets, we might take that, Madam Chair-I apologize.  But I think it's phrase that 19 things we were going to do 'in the context of price stability,' which gave the

to say a couple of things.  First, I think never looked at asset purchases as other than a second-best tool.  I think that's been the very beginning-uncertain as to its effect, uncertain as to as to political economy characteristics. On gearing up quantitative easing again, I want we've way it's been talked about since the bad effects, and certainly uncertain a decision to end reinvestments and then a decision to reverse that as not at me, they're two completely different think if the Committee were to decide to end reinvestments and then six months later an easy decision to begin reinvestments again on the to work with in the way of rate cuts to make.  So I look at as very different. I would put all akin to a decision to start asset purchases again.  To things.  I there were a shock, I think it would be grounds that we would have so little those decisions

the 'until normalization of the level of the the 1 percent or 2 percent thresholds. the real economy effects are tiny, and, if I'm right they would be even smaller if, Those things lead me to a strong preference for federal funds rate is well under way.'  I could learn to like I will say that

September 16-17, 2015

irreversibility assumption is really not right as a practical matter.  But I'm open to those.  I'd prefer to work with interest rates until we get way away from the in fact, the learning more about effective lower bound.  Thank you.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Brainard. CHAIR

a to maintain the parsimony and clarity of our policy framework and, second, by what I over the period that we are lead me to favor a 2 percent quantitative target. MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My judgment is animated by, first, desire believe to be asymmetric risk-management considerations considering.  Those considerations agreed to over the past year makes the federal funds the focal point for our policy stance.  It's clear, it's familiar to market participants, and it's to keep the focus on that.  In addition, we've spent be very reluctant reinvestment policy in any way migrate back toward a time-based framework. The policy framework that we've rate empirically well understood, and I'd like considerable effort over the past several meetings trying to make the public understand that our policy framework is based on the economic outlook and not on a calendar.  I'd to have our

most parsimonious way to capture economic developments is to condition our behavior of the one variable that we have focused on, It summarizes information from a wide variety of economic toward our goals. I think the reinvestment policy very clearly on the which is the federal funds rate. indicators on progress think the staff analysis did a very nice believe the bar for reinitiating QE is at all similar to turning on and off reinvestment.  So I do believe that effective lower bound constraint is a very important one. With regard to risk-management considerations, I job of laying those out.  Like others, I don't a bar for a 25 basis point cut, for instance, or that

September 16-17, 2015

those reasons, I would like to see the reinvestment conditioned on a 2 percent rate. it's clear, it gives us that cushion, and we can easily avoid the notion that you turn off you're think that would be pretty easy to introduce into the For all I think reinvestment permanently once you've hit 2 percent by making clear that only while above 2 percent would reinvestment cease.  I language.  That would be my strong preference.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  Is there anybody else who'd like to Governor Fischer. CHAIR comment?

I failed to thank the MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  This is not only because staff for their very good work the first time around, so I asked for a second time.  Thank you for the quality of the work you did.

certain point is Bullard made it sound like it was very easy, but I think it is possibly the solution and what we need-that is, begin reinvesting again if the federal funds rate goes below a certain level, and 2 percent gives us a conditional reinvestment policy, which I think makes a lot of terms of combining the risk-management feature, as I think Governor Brainard and to reduce the size of the portfolio. I think the issue of whether we can stop running off the portfolio at a critical to this discussion.  President will actually take some thought about how to present that before we can get that as part of the solution.  What Governor Brainard just said we can sounds attractive.  That sense in Governor Tarullo called it, with our desire what's going to happen as the portfolio starts getting down to the What happens, in that case, if we suddenly find ourselves heading off in a direction interest rate beginning to decline for a variety of reasons and then actually want, at that point, to start buying assets, I rates, We need to think about target level. that we don't want to go with the this leads us to begin to worry?  We think-that is, to do quantitative easing before it's quantitative easing at zero interest

September 16-17, 2015

is just another way of saying we need flexibility on the issue of allowed to increase the size of the balance sheet in terms of the conditions we place which is a bigger problem.  This when we're on ourselves.

think that's something the staff can work on very well.  My conclusion from this quite a few people, have referred to the possibility of might need to specify in more detail what it is that will happen that will allow us to turning it on and off in terms that are clear, understandable, and acceptable to I discussion is that not everybody, but turning on and off the end of the reinvestment process and that the 2 percent level is a good one. And then we explain why we're the public.

we have found a better way, are we not use it because we hadn't thought of using it until now?  There must be an elegant I think this has been an extremely useful discussion.  What has come out of it is a way of rethinking our principles for reducing the size of the portfolio.  Do we have to stick by what we said when we haven't actually implemented anything?  If allowed to solution.

was watching an interview of Justice Souter by Charlie Rose, and there was discussion on the topic, What do words mean?  Charlie Rose kept inventing complicated and asking, 'Is that acceptable under the law?'  And Souter kept saying, 'Well, words everybody understands needs to be done, we need to find a way within the words Well, I wonder if we can do that for ourselves as well.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

Yes. MR. POTTER.

ended up delaying cessation of reinvestment until 2018 or later, that would be, in operational terms and in terms of effect on markets, more challenging than if it were to happen during that two-year window?  Or does it that it's probably not worth using as a criterion? MR. TARULLO.  If we do you anticipate significantly depend on so many other factors

The operational part for Treasury securities is not that difficult because rolling over at auctions.  To reinvest the MBS-remember that we're purchasing in the the same costs that we have right also have the experience.  There's one issue, which is that if we stopped restart, we still have to have the experience to restart.  And that's the discussion today. MR. POTTER. we're secondary market, so that has operational cost to it.  But it's now, and we reinvestment and had to something that we should think about after

In contrast, the values of your projections of real GDP growth for 2016 and 2017 are lower than in June, with several of you attributing the decline productivity growth.

Thanks for the briefing, as always. many of them seemed to me as downside alternatives, especially in terms of staff were asked to talk about scenarios that might give rise to CHAIR MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. I found the discussion of the alternative scenarios in Tealbook A quite informative, as usual.  I was struck by how the price stability mandate.  If the an overrun in inflation, what would that potentially look like?

one that I think that there's some drift that occurs in inflation expectations.  We debated more plausible direction of drift in inflation expectations is up or down.  But I do me, is that the little bit of extra inflation pipeline from the dollar and the oil prices is going to put my own assessment is that while I either direction as quite plausible, I think it's a little more likely MR. WILCOX.  We actually contemplated putting in one of those.  The is plausible for us is whether the think that an upward drift of inflation expectations is certainly within our confidence intervals. At the moment, the more natural mechanism, it seems to transitory restraint that's in the a little more gravitational pull downward on inflation.  And so see inflation expectations drift in

makes my question a little more relevant mentioned the FRB/US model.  When I was looking through Tealbook A, on page the FRB/US model.  I noticed that the core PCE FRB/US model has 2017 inflation moving down to 1.0 percent, at 1.5 percent.  I wonder what features of the data and the are generating that somewhat aberrant behavior. MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  David, let me pick up where you left off there, and thanks for panel 3 on output gap estimates, which because you 79, I came across alternative models and projection coming out of the whereas in the June Tealbook it's model

WILCOX. The FRB/US model has a different wage-price mechanism than the The model pays attention to compensation trends.  There's an price markup over marginal cost in the FRB/US model.  I'm going to look here for my former FRB/US colleague. MR. judgmental forecast does. equation for confirmation from

MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  That's correct.

in putting together our inflation projection, the relationship off as noninformative.  The FRB/US model, partly MR. WILCOX.  I don't think we provide you with a graph of the markup of price over marginal cost in your Tealbook materials, but staff has pretty much written that for a bit of intellectual diversity, hasn't chucked that specification overboard and views the high level of prices over marginal costs as posing a downside impetus on inflation.  And so that's mainly what's generating this difference.

September 16-17, 2015

coming in seem to have moved it downward. MR. EVANS.  So the forecast was already pretty low in the June Tealbook at 1ยฝ percent for 2017, but the differential data

WILCOX.  Yes.  My guess is that two things are going on there.  One-probably material of the two-is the recent tranche of disappointing compensation news that we suspect is quantitatively tiny, but might be there in principle-is that a tiny upward revision in nonmarket prices in the annual revision.  So the FRB/US larger of those two is the MR. the more got.  The other-which I there was model might be picking up on that, but I'm guessing that the compensation.

is it fair to say that this implementation of the model is putting less weight on the longer-term inflation expectations anchor than other that we normally are looking at or the preferred inflation model that you're using? MR. EVANS.  Just to close this out, FRB/US analyses for policymakers in the model, and that has complete credibility.  So households and businesses don't question MR. WILCOX.  I think so.  There's an inflation objective FRB/US the 2 percent objective.

there, but that's not MR. EVANS.  I'm sorry.  Let me clarify.  Yes, it has that feature in enough to pull up the inflation forecast given the other countervailing data developments.

WILCOX. Yes, that's evident in the projection that you're pointing to. MR.

MR. EVANS.  Yes, okay.  Thank you.

Since our previous seen further improvement in labor markets, although the recent data on wages and prices are consistent with the continued persistent undershooting of our 2 percent inflation goal.

My view is that the general contours of the national outlook have very much during the intermeeting period, and that we are on the precipice of that will demonstrate financial markets, especially equity wanted to react directly to equity price movements, changing its view on this issue, we should say so as players about how we plan to proceed when this Committee.

In addition, the index was arguably abnormally low during recent quarters interest rate spreads unusually compressed.  From this point some of the return to a in the St. Louis Fed's financial stress index, or other related revisions to my forecast that would alter worried about a weaker growth meeting, but my view is effect on U.S. have continued to project in St. Louis above-trend growth the forecast horizon.  We think our growth call for to the September 10 Blue Chip forecast, which itself is notably In short, the increase indexes, is not enough to cause me to make sufficient my path for monetary policy.  I understand that many may be outlook globally than would have been projected at the previous FOMC that many of the weak spots globally were clearly flagged during June and July, and that marginally weaker growth prospects globally are unlikely to have a meaningful growth prospects.  Accordingly, we for the second half of 2015 and, indeed, over the remainder of 2015 is close above the Board staff view.

Although it today, that the staff view is overly Committee has now received information on the revisions now appears to have been above trend, adding to the picture of an economy that continues to push forward even in the face of a large dollar appreciation over the past previous meeting have generally been very good.  And, if recent history is a to currently reported jobs numbers as we go Above-trend growth is likely to continue to mean even tighter labor markets.

Still, it is is likely to fall below 4ยฝ percent over the in train, as the Committee has already committed to a very easy monetary policy I appreciate projections, which have probably not enough, as the unemployment rate forecast horizon with above-trend growth and no major negative shocks.

There has, of course, been considerable talk about Chinese growth prospects during the intermeeting period.  My assessment is as follows.  The Shanghai composite index is not a meaningful indicator of U.S. growth prospects and probably not of China's growth prospects either.  This before falling to around 3,000 during the intermeeting period.  This was a because of factors specific to China.

It is an old issue. this point that China is entering a true hard landing, point I agree with the Board staff analysis. Of course, many have commented that China may be growing slower than the official numbers indicate.  I have, in fact, flagged this comment from business contacts with significant operations in Chinese markets sectors.  I do think that growth may be somewhat think this is And, in my view, there is scant evidence at and on this

This is news, and, indeed, this is concerned that our pending action will be viewed as a reaction to this that should think of an appropriate level expect equity valuations-really, the value of the U.S. corporate sector-to return to this appropriate level regardless of week-to-week volatility.  If that's movements in equity valuations would not have therefore, on likely to the firms represented expect wages to increase 3 percent this year, even firms that have workers that are on end of the income distribution.  I was surprised by that. My final comments concern inflation, which is running low today but is strengthen over the forecast horizon.  According to my board of directors, there all the lower

In any event, low oil prices are ultimately a bullish factor for the U.S. economy, not a negative factor.  TIPS-based expected inflation measures are low and have fallen during the intermeeting period.  I would normally be quite concerned about this, but unfortunately highly conflated with oil price movements and so are difficult to read in the current circumstances.

I am very concerned that the Committee does not overreact to what are real-side developments during the see very tight labor markets ahead, barring a large shock.  I also see risk Overall, essentially financial market developments as opposed to intermeeting period.  I

The current retail revenues index reading in the index slipped a bit in August but, at 28, was services and manufacturing.

In contrast, service-sector activity remained robust in recent survey results and contact reports, especially on the retail rose to 44 in August from 35 in July and 15 in June, reaching the fourth-highest 22-year history of that series.  The nonretail services still the third-highest reading in that series.  Readings on expected activity remained strong across both August-they won't be released for a couple of weeks, but

Many contacts cite shortages for and the Fifth District.  I recognize contacts report that wage pressures are in some outsized wage gains, and they suggest that such pressures are prevalent in a surveys have strengthened considerably over the past year or I continue to hear widespread reports of wage pressures in that the second-quarter ECI number appears to have thrown cold water on the notion of nominal wage acceleration in the national data.

Perhaps the occupations, but our reports do seem to indicate tightened in recent months.  Despite reports of broad-based our survey results, and contact reports

This faster pace was interrupted in the first quarter of are now known to have been temporary factors, including unusually harsh Turning to the national in my view, besides household expenditures.  Real consumer spending accelerated from less than 2 percent in the years prior this year by what winter weather.  But with that pothole behind us, consumption growth has returned to a 3 percent annual rate.

This sustained step-up in the pace of consumption about interest rates.  I'll say more about this later, but, real consumption growth should be associated with higher real interest Reflecting the momentum in labor solid pace.  I expect than the growth is important to my thinking broadly speaking, higher rates.

Business fixed investment weakened beginning late orders bottomed out last spring and have been increasing since.  Nonresidential construction spending, apart from oil and gas, has registered strong gains as well, as has residential investment spending.  Even before the August employment report, I would have argued that we had seen substantial further improvements in labor market conditions job gains having slowed considerably, it is decline at an impressive rate.  The August employment report obviously revealed additional labor market improvement.

about broader measures of labor utilization.  I have also approaches to calculating an appropriate benchmark to gauge labor all measures of labor any plausible result, I don't have not seen further improvement in labor markets. I have spoken in past meetings spoken about alternative market conditions.  At this point, however, it seems clear that virtually market utilization have fallen enough to be statistically indistinguishable from normative benchmark one might choose to represent maximum employment.  As a see how we can say we argue that there is likely to be additional slack in labor markets if nominal wage accelerating.  But real wage rates are related to productivity growth, and been slow for several years now.  Wage growth in real terms has at least past year, has significantly Some rates are not productivity growth has kept pace with productivity gains over that time period and, in the outpaced productivity.  So I don't see the behavior of wage rates as providing evidence that there is any remaining labor market slack.

data also seem to suggest that labor market slack is minimal.  Job openings employers are having an increasingly hard time to hire, and slack in any meaningful sense has been substantially The JOLTS have been increasing more rapidly than hiring for several years now, but the divergence has widened at an increasing pace this year.  As of July, job openings have increased by 12ยฝ percent from their average in the fourth quarter of 2014, while the hiring rate has been virtually flat.  The natural interpretation would seem to be that finding suitable workers reduced.

The behavior of inflation moves should bolster that confidence.

might argue that the strength in headline inflation was aided by the 7.8 percent inflation was relatively close to 2 percent this year.  I think our experience following the the 1ยฝ percent decline in the overall price effect on trend extent that the current disinflationary impulse from energy prices and the previous one, it ought to bolster our confidence that inflation will rebound to it did earlier this year. One rebound in energy prices from January to July, but core despite the continuing decrease in import prices previous disinflationary surprise is good evidence that level over the six months prior to last January was transitory and left no lasting inflation.

Still, it recognizes that the been falling more sharply than I've been anticipating, and wage risen significantly.  With above-trend growth, I see the unemployment rate longer-run level until 2018.

Of course, in view of the error bands estimates, I unemployment rate has pressures have not yet falling to 4.8 percent by the end of next year and remaining below its running below target, but I project inflation will return to in early 2017.  This is slightly later than in my June projection to allow to pass through. Currently, headline inflation is our 2 percent objective for the transitory effects of the most recent declines in energy and import prices I continue to anticipate inflation will gradually return to our target because I expect output growth to be above trend, labor markets to continue their strengthening, and inflation expectations to remain stable.

Some work by my own staff shows that share doesn't automatically imply that firms can get higher profits by creating new jobs.  There's an example they studied, that if

So, in their model, you would find a push up the theory.  Looking at the time somewhat than upward movement in recent decades.  And looking at the worker side appear to have fallen, not risen, as looked at this across different subgroups-short-term and consistent finding is that rising the way the theory would suggest.  So I really don't see that the natural rate has come down because of a fall in labor share. But, more importantly, the evidence is inconsistent with the series data for the United States, vacancies per unemployed worker have not increased as the labor share has fallen over the previous couple of decades.  If anything, the data show of a downward rather of the equation, you see the same thing.  The job-finding rates the theory would suggest, and we've long-term unemployed, and people out of the labor force.  Again, the job-finding rates are not convincing evidence

We decided to stick with looking at a 20-year pre-recession to actually change much over the next few years.  So that is my long-run Now, the similar methods.  They looked at a shorter period of time, and they got a estimate.

the Committee's unwillingness to communicate openly about its post-liftoff framework My sense from the internal discussions here is that there is a strong desire to return to the 'normal' policy framework that was employed during the Great Moderation.

led the Committee to promulgate persistent shortfalls in prices and employment.  What I'll do today is what I see as a better framework and describe what that better framework would Our pre-2008 policy framework failed in this dimension.  It deliberately point out what I see as being the key conceptual flaw in the pre-2008 framework, and tomorrow I will suggest imply for current decisions.

The median participant's assessment was that, under appropriate monetary policy, rate would still be 7 percent in three years.  At the same time, the median inflation would only we had unemployment at and inflation at 1ยฝ percent. To understand my criticism of the pre-2008 framework, it's useful to go back to the November 2009 meeting, which was the very beginning of the recovery.  At that meeting, the latest unemployment reading was 9.8 percent and the staff's nowcast for core inflation was 1.4 percent. the unemployment participant's assessment was that, under appropriate monetary policy, PCE rise back to 1ยฝ percent three years later.  So, three years later, 7 percent quite surprising.  You can draw one of threat that was perceived by the Committee.  On the other price-stability mandate and say that monetary policy can't do is a view that has been expressed around this table before.  Or, price stability mandate and say that the Committee was willing to and put the credibility of its then-informal 2 percent target in jeopardy. When I was reading these numbers, I found them two conclusions from them.  On the one hand, you can say that the Committee was willing, in November 2009, to forgo the timely creation of hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of jobs in the absence of any inflationary hand, you can focus only on the much about unemployment.

Why did the Committee view such a persistent and extreme shortfall with respect objectives as more than the Committee anticipated-or anyone else anticipated, for that matter. ended up being around what the Committee viewed as being desirable-thanks, I think, A quick side note:  Labor market recovery actually turned out to be much worse than that.  Unemployment was 7.8 percent three years later, and labor force participation declined much Inflation in no little part, to choices made by the Committee.  But why did the Committee, in November 2009, view such a persistent extreme shortfall with respect to its objectives as being appropriate?

rule.  And this framework continues to live on in the collection of interest Tealbook B.  In my view, all of these rules have a key conceptual dual mandate, which is to promote price stability and rules are based on the presumption that the Committee has are independent of the objectives The answer, I believe, lies in the pre-2008 policy framework, which centered on variants of the Taylor (1993) rate rules that we see in shortcoming.  The Committee has a maximum employment.  The Taylor other objectives in terms of the time path of interest rates that for employment and prices.

implicitly presumes that the Committee does not like rate gaps.  The FOMC desires to keep the federal funds rate close to its long-run level. then trades off the Committee's unmandated aversion to interest rate gaps against its direction-unemployment too high, inflation too low-you more.  But the Taylor rule says, wait a second, you shouldn't be The original Taylor (1993) rule interest The rule mandated aversion to unemployment and inflation gaps.  Otherwise, if you saw unemployment and inflation gaps going in the same should just lower rates some doing that, because actually you don't want to move interest rates around too much.

That the natural rate for four years and inflation at or below We didn't get to see the staff outlook beyond a five-year horizon, so I any sense of when it ever got back to 2 percent. The way that the Taylor volatility-especially when the Phillips curve is as flat outcomes.  So, in November 2009, the staff's outlook was based on the Taylor (1993) outlook had unemployment above 1.6 percent for five years. don't have rates when the rate is in the 9s or in the 8s?  The Summary of Economic Projections shows that inflation.  Rather, it was the Committee's My reading of the transcript, in terms of participants' contributions, is that aversion to accommodation, as opposed to inflation or unemployment, was really at the heart of that discussion.  The big debate at that meeting was, should we plan to raise unemployment the key motivating factor for this debate was not really willingness to give up on its dual-mandate goals in order to get back to normalizing policy more rapidly.

successfully healing the latter part of the past decade.  But our monetary was not as successful.  I attribute this to the Committee's policy framework, in in November 2009. Madam Chair, the Federal Reserve did such a heroic job of extraordinary financial market turmoil in policy response which deliberately directed the economy toward relatively persistent large employment and inflation shortfalls.  I think we need to have a policy framework that works considerably better the face of adverse shocks than we had available shortcomings of our pre-2008 framework can be traced to its rule.  These rules implicitly impose a large penalty on an unusual use of our tools as I have argued today that reliance on variants of the Taylor historically unusual settings of the federal funds rate and other forms of accommodation.  We need to have a policy framework that is much less averse to

opposed to achieving our objectives.  Tomorrow I will talk about such a framework and some of its implications for our current decisionmaking.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

But I think this is certainly something we can talk the surveys, for example, done by the interest were under about over drinks.

And beyond.  [Laughter]  Over many drinks.  Okay. as I'm concerned, the economy has been on essentially the same been on for some time, growth slightly above trend and sufficient to labor market.

Despite believe the economy has table downside.

are a number of reasons for Turning to the economic growth outlook, I think there concern.  Most importantly, we do have a quite dicey international situation, with growth slowing in China and commodity prices weakening broadly, and I think this is putting

rating to junk bond status by S&amp;P.  So we'll see considerable strain on a wide array of emerging market economies.  For example, last week we had the downgrade of Brazil's sovereign debt how that actually plays out.

happening is that we're undergoing a pretty significant regime few years ago when strong Chinese demand was keeping commodity prices well of new production.  The result was a very favorable terms-of-trade shift many EMEs that are commodity producers and a very strong impetus to investment in those think the risks are that the consequences for I think generally what's shift from a above the marginal cost for countries.  Now, all of that has been reversing, and I global growth could turn out to be stronger and longer lasting than we'd expected.

The growth, currency weakness, a deterioration in many countries' political stress. for some time.  So let me just sketch this out.  I'm not saying this is going to happen, I just think there's some probability to further stress on many EMEs.  That leads to of yet, further capital flight, and further For us, it means that dollar strength persists, and this erodes our own growth and puts further downward pressure on inflation.  Also, the strong dollar increases corporates that have significant dollar-denominated debt exposure. Weakness in commodity prices leads corporate difficulties, which we haven't seen much currency weakness. momentum the stress on EME

and a softer U.S. equity market.  U.S. financial conditions keep tightening.  I don't much weight to put on this scenario, but what I think is interesting about this scenario The stronger dollar also squeezes U.S. profit margins, leading to weaker corporate earnings know how

the risks here are not zero.  When we went around the table, a lot of I think the markets are It strikes me that people were just saying, 'There's stuff going on in the markets.' reflecting fundamental developments that are occurring in the global economy, and as a consequence of that, I take those financial market developments more seriously.

I, like others, don't put of the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso versus the U.S. think that those countries have pretty good economic policy and Yet currently the Canadian dollar trades at 1.32 per U.S. dollar; a year 1.10.  The same for the Mexican peso, which has depreciated about 30 percent over three months.  These are two major U.S. trading whose currency has moved a lot, and I don't think we've really seen the consequences Financial conditions have already tightened significantly as the dollar has appreciated on a broad trade-weighted much weight on the equity market decline yet because it hasn't been in place for very long, but the dollar strength has been persistent and does threaten to undermine U.S. net exports.  I'm particularly struck by the weakness dollar because we generally institutional structures. ago it was at the past year and nearly 10 percent over the past partners of that in terms of our trade.

think there are other reasons to be just set aside the international stuff for a minute. Moreover, apart from international developments, I concerned about the growth outlook.  So let's to the underlying growth trajectory.  People said, 'Well, that's just going to continue.'  It's not obvious to me that that would continue thing that is happening is, profit growth is really slowing down.  And we've heard First, job gains have been strong relative have because one

September 16-17, 2015

are now really looking at how they are going to raise earnings, and they're going to have to start being tougher and begin to think about downsizing. that a number of corporations maybe an annual rate.  That's probably longer term. Second, I think we've had a pretty significant climb in inventory investment, and that provided a significant contribution to growth in the first half of the year.  In the second quarter, the real nonfarm inventory build was almost $120 billion at more than double what's sustainable over the

we were talking about how the household savings rate seemed what was implied by the historical relationship between household net worth and look high anymore.  We're back at 4.8 percent of disposable the same level we saw in 2013 and 2014, so I don't think we have so much Third, earlier this year, high relative to disposable income.  That was making us feel more optimistic about consumption, that consumption could grow faster than income for a time because the household savings rate was high.  But after revisions, it doesn't income.  That's support from that.

much, and I don't think it is particularly worrisome as long an above-trend pace.  If you could guarantee that the the strength of U.S. growth, that does make me the mechanism that's going to push inflation back up toward our objective. With respect to inflation, with the exception of the softness in commodity prices, I also don't think the situation has changed as the economy continues to grow at economy was going to grow at an above-trend pace, I wouldn't be that worried about the inflation outlook, but because I'm worried about worry about weaker import prices, the trend for core This suggests to me that if growth does remain above trend, then the of itself.  That said, the fact that nominal wage growth has mind, have excess slack in the labor market. The fact is that, despite falling energy prices and inflation has flattened out. low inflation problem will take care not picked up yet implies that we still, in my

of waiting, in terms of beginning Combined with the sluggish growth trend and the downside risk to growth threatened by international developments, this suggests to me that the costs monetary policy normalization, are pretty low right now.

longer so we can better assess the consequences of and among the EMEs in terms of the implications regarding U.S. growth to be of sufficient intensity to deflect the U.S. if we wait a effect turns out to be insignificant, then we can go before year-end, and I objectives.  Speaking My preference would be to wait a bit developments in China and inflation.  As I see it, the risks around liftoff right now are asymmetric.  If we go now and the international market developments prove economy away from our objectives, the cost could be quite high to us.  Conversely, little bit longer and the don't really think we give up much in terms of our ability to achieve our for myself, I won't feel particularly bad if we waited and then it turns out everything is fine.  I think I'll feel pretty good about that.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

rate, which is PCE is projected to be only 0.3 percent at that time.  The main reason for the 1 percentage rates of PCE inflation arises from the recent excluded by using the core PCE rate.  Oil prices affect the cost of production of many goods.  Moreover, the effects on the prices of many goods. Many discussions of inflation start with the 12-month core PCE inflation currently 1.2 percent and projected to be 1.3 percent by the end of the year, although total inflation point difference between the core and the total declines in oil prices, which are expected to be temporary.  However, changes in oil prices have an effect on PCE prices that goes beyond the prices that are inflation appreciation of the dollar has direct effect of recent changes in oil and import prices on the inflation ratethe declines in together have reduced the overall inflation rate by approximately 1.4 the transitory factors, such as using mean PCE or a weighted median PCE price index and other measures, reasonably similar conclusion on balance. The additional over and above what's picked up in food and energy prices-is estimated by staff at approximately 0.4 percentage point this year.  Accordingly, we can conclude that oil and import prices percentage points.  More-rigorous methods of stripping out the Dallas Fed trimmed yield a

Thank you, Madam Chair.  Like, I think, most of you, no matter your disposition on monetary policy, I haven't changed my baseline outlook very much over the course of the past six or minutes ago, the downside risks are palpably greater people to my left-I don't mean ideologically, I concerned about other piece of if it had just been U.S. equity markets going down, even if it had gone the day rather than 3 percent, I truly would have taken no notice of that, much signal from that.  But it's a correction in the job market.  And I believe the responded in a less-than-fully-considered fashion was not because they're bad or I would embrace everything Vice Chairman Dudley said and just add one information here.  I think down 6 percent over particularly after a long period of appreciation of equity markets.  And even if it had just been China's equity markets in isolation, I wouldn't have taken too combination of what have long been known to be building concerns with the amount of leverage and credit in China in the background as Chinese officials responded in a less-than-fullyconsidered fashion to what was going on with the reason they

September 16-17, 2015

that worries Chinese officials most in the near term is the margining that lies behind a lot of those holdings in equity markets, and the margining is less fully realized is how closely that connects to the regular regulated banking in China. My impression is that the thing amount of is connected very directly to the amount of credit extended through the shadow banking system. I think what system as well read the concern with putting a floor under Chinese equities to be indicative of the level and leverage throughout the Chinese economy right now. and the failures last time around, be some sort because there's going to be another point at which the losses are such as to provide more-direct risks to the banking system. I of concern with the state of credit Obviously my impression is based on incomplete information and selected contact, but the impression I have is that if the decline in Chinese equity markets was to renew and continue for a while, there would, notwithstanding the concerns of effort to put another floor under it amount of potential

behind both the market movements and the market movements that Vice Chairman Dudley, I think we really think it's almost certain that over the next several years, those challenges translate into the somewhat Board staff or something a little more disruptive, we just don't So, I think, as Bill was suggesting, it's what lies the policy responses and some of the policy uncertainty about suggests potential for longer-term problems.

of my time on labor markets, and having made a joke about what doing, I'm going to proceed to do something not dissimilar, which is to try to give a a lot of talk within this room, by many of you outside this room, and by many other to or at fill-in-the-blank:  the natural rate, full employment, it may be. I want to spend the rest Narayana is bit of perspective on how we've been assessing labor markets, not monetary policy as a whole. There is people about how we are close maximum employment, whatever is tautological to say rate, than we were at the June meeting and the meetings before that because, during this period, we're creating more But much closer are we, and how do we know how much slack remains? And what I want to know is, how do people know this?  I mean, it that we're closer to full employment, maximum employment, the natural the July meeting and unemployment has been going down and job creation has been such that jobs than the number of entrants into the labor market.  Almost tautologically, we are closer. how

made judgments about labor market getting to the natural rate or getting to the non-accelerating inflation rate of at wages, which leading indicator of prices.  Remember that the 'I' in NAIRU stands for and other analysts were trying to make that connection. Conventionally, the way in which we collectively tightness or unemployment was by looking at prices or, oftentimes, actually, more directly were thought to be a inflation, and that was where we six or seven of you referred to wage pressures being reported to be the case that the number of you now that we may be closer to the point at which wage pressures start But as of this moment, they really haven't translated into the data as a that the Now, I didn't count, but from your Districts.  I have to say, a number of presidents have been reporting wage pressures from their Districts for some years now, and I take it talking about it suggests translating into the data. whole.  That, of course, is a reminder of what people have also commented on, which is

table and their staffs, have subsequently relationships, but to date I don't think anybody knows what those relationships are now. Now, people, including the people around this made efforts to assess labor market tightness based on some set of past don't think these relationships really panned out as particularly robust.  It's not the fault of anybody.  I

people were talking about how the the rightward shift in the Beveridge curve showed that there was structural were all of a sudden going Remember there was a suggestion a since short-term unemployment rates were now back to pre-recession rate of unemployment.  It was a good try, didn't work out either. A few years ago around this table, I remember persistence of unemployment and, therefore, the natural rate must be higher, and we to begin seeing wage inflation.  That didn't happen, right? couple of years ago that levels, we were functionally getting close to the natural but that one approach-to use demographics and try to I think if you disconnect the concept of the of unemployment from at least wage inflation, if not price inflation, then the whole a little bit squishy, because what is it that we're talking about we talking about 'satisficing' unemployment?  Do we think it's good enough, it's low I think we're not actually any longer in the realm of doing analysis, but instead acting because U-3 is toward the low end of where it has been over the course President Williams has just suggested another project where the 'natural rate' would lie.  But natural rate concept actually gets more than now?  Are enough? on some intuition.  Just of the past couple of decades doesn't tell us much.  Maybe it's temporarily lower now because of

September 16-17, 2015

part-time employment for economic reasons and the lower-than-trend labor elevated participation ratio.  Maybe not.

than people being a sense, because nobody actually has a convincing set of me, it was crystallized in the staff briefing to the Board at yesterday's when I noticed that the projected path of wages over the next couple of years was rising, productivity gains would be passed through and inflation would pull up wages.  Of I asked about the productivity gains issue because, I think my understanding is that much wages can go up over the medium-to-long term, but in than nearclearly haven't been passed through at some For me, this dilemma-and I mean to project it as a dilemma rather wrong, because we're all wrong, in explanations.  But for meeting and the explanation given in the briefing was not principally because of labor market tightness, but because course, productivity gains matter for how the short term, wages really should be about the supply and demand of labor rather term productivity increases.  But even so, productivity gains in anything like one-to-one or even 50 percent fashion in recent years.  They might be point, but it's a little hard to predict.

inflation come from that was going to came from inflation expectations, and we're back, as David Wilcox noted a earlier this afternoon, into a reliance on a mechanism that we don't completely understand, taken is, they've found Assuming the now-low productivity gains will get passed through theory regarding why this is all working this way. Then, what about inflation?  Well, where did the pull up wages?  It little and what we really don't understand is how those expectations change.  They seem to have worked, and I think the reason the staff has hit upon the approach they've some things that had been working reasonably well over the past five or six years. anchored expectations and assuming that seems to be working, but not because there's a

paper that you referred to by Andrew and another effort to get into that.  I think you were slightly unfair because I think you were to be right now. And, President Williams, the Board research David is referring to the aggregate data and they made a big point of trying to disaggregate the data.  I don't think anybody thinks you can figure out much from the aggregate data.  But even if we abstract from that, they're being very tentative, as I think everybody has more than the normal amount of doubt about the reliability of particularly medium-term forecasting.  And I Presidents and Kaplan-who weren't here-everybody around this table was wrong, and we were So, this level of uncertainty, as I've said before, about even the theories on which we're operating, seems to me to argue for forecasting based on past observed relationships, cannot resist this.  I pulled out the September 2014 SEP.  With the exceptions of Harker all wrong in the same direction on both inflation and unemployment for 2015.  We all projected

September 16-17, 2015

than it actually is, and we all projected inflation as being higher a year ago. unemployment as being higher than it actually is.  And that was just bit more of a show-me approach.  I actually want to see some hard data And I suspect, again, it's because of the difficulty of reading what's going on now, and to me that suggests reliance on a more pragmatic policy approach, which is a little bit more-sorry, Jim and Esther-a little before acquiring reasonable confidence in the direction in which we're going and a little bit more skepticism about projecting what will happen based on past observed relationships.

But I do think the reliance on past correlations is something that can lead us astray in a period that has, temporarily but certainly for a while, really disrupted a lot of those correlations. Let me end by saying that I honestly do not mean this to be an argument of 'low rates forever because of uncertainty.'  We After a period of growth being noticeably above trend, their wage report was really quite strong.

Abroad there are increased U.S. growth and inflation, and, in particular, we face tighter financial conditions here in the United States in the form of a stronger dollar and lower equity prices, this point, and I was going to make it tomorrow, but I'll just echo that this really has nothing to do with a drop in the U.S. stock market.  I have market investor for a long time.  I would say that a 7 percent stock market decline a story of a plausible tail risk, or maybe more than a tail risk, of a global there is any publicly on that. Governor Tarullo made it today, which is been a stock after a very long period of expansion would mean just about literally nothing for the U.S. economy.  This is about economic slowdown.  There is nothing about an equity put.  And to the extent confusion, our communication should be clear

real economy have come in better than expected.  Payroll growth has been anticipated, it is likely to be held down at least for a while by the stronger dollar and the additional tighter economy should move inflation higher in the mandate and declining-a situation that the setting for our policy decision, as I will discuss tomorrow. Data on the strong.  Unemployment has declined faster than the staff forecast.  First-half GDP was revised up by 1 full percentage point since the previous meeting.  Inflation has come in about as but decline in oil prices.  Looking forward, the medium term, but for now inflation is both below complicates path of 2 percent growth or a little my own, that they would be moving to a higher plane. inflation and trend productivity, real unit labor costs have actually been about as fast as they were before the crisis and as fast as they have for a current wage increases fully Wages and compensation have continued on their better, disappointing hopes, including However, with very low rising modestly-rising long time.

Now, a real employer would never use hard to imagine an employer thinking, Why would I be paying higher world in which inflation is incredibly low, growth is slow, and productivity increases slack. compensate workers for those words, but it's not wages in a are quite slow?  I find that to be quite a plausible narrative, although I also believe that wages are sending a signal about the Chair has been very careful not to make wages a litmus test for a rate increase, the right place to be.  I can imagine a world in which we had price that don't respond, no matter how low unemployment goes.  I inflation does, and the longto reverse.  I wouldn't want to stand in the way of that if it was on price inflation, which is, of course, our statutory I think and I would say, I think that's inflation that went up and wages can imagine a different world in which wages go up more than price time decline in labor share starts to happen.  I think we ought to focus mandate.

baseline. a sharp slowdown in the number of payroll jobs, the past four years to an average of 1.5 million for the next to be a way of returning productivity growth closer to trend.  But assumption that has critical implications for policy. Although my September SEP forecast is close to the Tealbook baseline, I expect the unemployment rate to fall faster and inflation to move to 2 percent sooner than in the In the Tealbook, growth for 2016 to 2018 continues at 2 percent, which is almost exactly the average over the past four years.  But there is from an average of 2.6 million over three years.  I understand that this is a key years ending in 2015, again, growth was 2.1 percent and unemployment three years, growth is 2.0 percent and 0.1 percent per year.  Now, productivity may increase in the next three certainly hope that it does.  But, of course, predicting it in the short term is For the four declined at 0.9 percent per year.  For the next unemployment declines years, and I

and it seems to me there is a reasonable probability that there won't be such a sharp data.  If there isn't, then taking the growth forecast as given, the result would be in the rate of is, in fact, my treacherous, break in the higher payroll growth, lower productivity growth, and a substantially faster decline unemployment, what might be called the 'more of the same' scenario, and that forecast.

even below, in 2017, well below my estimate of the natural rate of our numbers [laughter].  And that consistent with the idea that we ought to be prepared to let unemployment decline below With growth much like that in the Tealbook, I have the unemployment rate declining to 4ยฝ percent, or perhaps 4.9 percent.  By the way, I am number 2, as we are giving out path is the natural rate to help lift trend inflation and support a more robust recovery from the ravages of the global financial crisis.

reasonably optimistic, as others have noted I think we need to meeting.  Weakness and policy misfires in China have meant declining commodity and financial turmoil, putting pressure on a range of emerging market economies, and U.S. economy of a slowdown or a crisis in the economies, and there are two such alternative simulations in this cycle's While my point forecast is acknowledge the risk of a period of global economic weakness, which has clearly increased since the previous prices tightening financial conditions globally.  In recent years, we have had frequent briefings focused on the potentially significant ramifications for the emerging market Tealbook.

But China's growth is is having sizable effects on the rest of emerging Asia and other emerging reliable hand of China's technocrats has seemed Although China faces significant structural difficulties and very challenging longer-term transition issues, I see slowing, and that market commodity producers.

The rest of the world has had plenty of warning and time to get ready for U.S. tightening.  Still, tightening into an actual emerging markets else again. to evolve.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

a material way that affects current and expected activity has strengthened, and we have seen some nice progress on the employment leg of mandate.  On the other hand, the foreign economic outlook, I think, has again contributed financial tightening and poses downside risks to the outlook.  We see no indication prices, and inflation remains stubbornly below our target. Recent developments reinforce, perhaps, or intensify the crosscurrents that we have seen in the economy for some time, and, I think, in future progress toward our objectives.  On the one hand, the underlying momentum on domestic real the materially to of an acceleration in either wages or employment to average gains so far this year, and August payrolls are revised up.  In addition, there continues to be improvement, on balance, along the Let me just spend a moment on each of these.  As you all have noted, the labor market has continued to improve nicely.  The three-month moving average of payroll growth was 220,000 in August, similar likely to be

September 16-17, 2015

this, the ongoing diminution of slack has yet in any noticeable acceleration in our three broad measures of wages. three main margins of labor market slack.  Despite to result that nominal wage growth is only the pace we have seen over the past The absence of such acceleration suggests that resources still are not fully utilized, time for economic reasons remains well above move-up in the equilibrium level in recent years.  As pointed out, although it is difficult to know with any precision what the natural rate absence in recent quarters of any upward movement in nominal wage growth and price as some indication that the natural rate is below the current level.  And I interesting to note that since our submissions in June, it appears that nine Committee dots-have moved their point estimates for the natural rate Average hourly earnings through August as well as compensation per hour and the employment cost index through the second quarter all suggest in the 2 to 2ยผ percent range, which is little different than several years. and I think other data send a similar signal.  Participation for prime-age adults remains well below pre-recession levels and below what pre-crisis trends in participation for this group would suggest.  The share of employees working part longer-run norms, even allowing for some others have is, the inflation has to be seen think it's members-and I'm just staring at the below 5 percent.

activity has been proceeding at a reassuring pace on most of equipment investment have also turned up of late. More broadly, domestic dimensions, suggesting demand is solid.  Although inventory investment in the second quarter looks elevated, suggesting a negative contribution in the second half of the year, other components of business investment look better than they did in July.  In particular, nonresidential building investment rose strongly in the second quarter, offsetting the weakness that we had seen in drilling investment, and indicators

September 16-17, 2015

of retail sales suggest consumer rising at a welcome pace moving into the second half.  Continued job growth and to support this.  And the latest data on building permits and of gradual recovery in housing. Strong auto sales and growth in other components spending is lower gas prices should continue starts continue to paint a picture

Domestic final sales rose 2ยฝ percent in the first half of 2015, and the Tealbook Overall, despite an anemic contribution from government spending, domestic demand is advancing. expects similar growth in the second half.  By contrast, manufacturing exports are on the soft side, and that brings me to the crosscurrents.

is very clear that foreign economic conditions are activity and inflation as well as on financial conditions in the United States.  At and in Japan, as well as main story.  More recently, weakness in foreign demand the 12 percent we saw earlier, we now have an additional 15 percent above its level last summer. Looking back over the past year, it weighing on real the end of last year, persistently weak aggregate demand in the euro zone the policy response, were kind of the has really focused on emerging market economies.  Growing recognition of this weakness has pushed the dollar up further, so after movement, and the dollar now lies been the focus of an intermeeting reassessment of global growth think China's contribution really has to be seen in the broader context of spillovers activity and the financial sector, not directly through trade channels to the United a decade and has been a also very closely many of the other neighboring economies in the region. China, in particular, has prospects.  I both in real States but as they reverberate around the global economy.  In particular, China has been at the center, really, of a commodity supercycle that has now endured for over very important source of demand for many commodity exporters and is connected to

September 16-17, 2015

levels and growing perceptions that Chinese deftly as previously anticipated, think, about broader global growth prospects and potential downside macroeconomic data that, I think, risks perpetuating the fog around the growth Most immediately, the buildup of past property and more recent stock market bubbles, together with a rapid run-up in business debt policymakers are not managing policy or communications as have raised concerns, I risks.  And those risks are compounded and perhaps amplified by well-known weakness in the quality of trajectory.

intermeeting developments as narrow equity market corrections as a broader reassessment of global growth about China's trajectory.  I think there is a nontrivial probability that we China's exchange rate much, but it does seem like they are in the midst of an is likely to reverberate, particularly because many other zone, and indirect effects of that material risk to our own outlook. Looking forward, in terms of the U.S. economy, I, like several other members of the Committee, really don't see the centered on the United States.  I really see it prospects and questions will see, sometime in the next few quarters, an additional adjustment of regime.  I can't tell you when or by how adjustment process, and that in turn foreign economies facing weak internal demand-including in East Asia, the euro Japan-will have to adjust their policies accordingly.  The direct and further adjustment will remain a that the effects of dollar appreciation, even the dollar appreciation likely to be quite persistent, and those effects, if the dollar appreciates to lead to additional restraint both on real activity and on U.S. inflation. Moreover, my sense is we have seen so far, are further, are likely

many have noted, remains between maybe 1ยผ to 1ยฝ percent, similar to couple of years and noticeably below our target.  If you That comes against a backdrop in which U.S. core PCE inflation remains quite subdued. The underlying trend, as the pace that we have seen in the past

September 16-17, 2015

the 12-month change in core PCE prices, or even if you look at the change in the Dallas trimmed mean, we are still substantially below our target and have not made any progress. the historically low levels reached at the look at Fed And although survey expectations provide some reassurance, the risks seem tilted to downside, as inflation compensation has moved back to the beginning of the year.

those reasons, I do see considerable value to waiting, and that value outweighs the because we will have an opportunity to return to this tomorrow, I'd be particularly of this risks of waiting, because I think that would be helpful in informing my Chair. For all cost.  But interested to hear from those who put the start of policy normalization in the third quarter year about the potential own policy outlook.  Thank you, Madam

YELLEN.  Thank you, and thanks to everyone for a very interesting round of situation.  I thought I my own assessment of the implications for the outlook. CHAIR comments and, I think, some very interesting observations on the current would wrap things up, if you wouldn't mind, by giving a summary of incoming data and their touch above have moved down as the number of discouraged workers continued to decline, and Starting with the labor market, as almost all of you noted, we've seen continued solid gains in monthly payrolls.  And at 5.1 percent, the unemployment rate stands just a the median of our estimates of its longer-run normal level.  Broader measures of labor utilization like U-6 also involuntary part-time employment edged down further.

with the views I heard expressed around the table, I think these developments have improved considerably since earlier in the year.  For that, at the July meeting, I said in my own view in September. Consistent confirm that labor market conditions me, they're also consistent with the conditions could warrant raising the funds rate

September 16-17, 2015

At the time, the available data seemed to suggest that wages finally beginning to respond to diminishing slack.  Since then, new readings on the ECI, per hour all indicate that we're still stuck at wage increases in vicinity of 2 percent, a very subdued pace if the economy really is near full employment. But back in July, I also indicated that stronger readings on wages would strengthen the case for liftoff, and instead, exactly the opposite has occurred.  And so, for me, wage developments weaken the case. were hourly earnings, and compensation the wage mentioned around the table, such as to attract and retain workers without raising wages, and even though we've job openings, the quits rate has flattened out, and that is despite all we hear about how difficult firms find it to fill some jobs.  On the margin, the have reinforced my sense that we are still a ways from full employment, I don't want to make too much of the news.  The relationship between nominal growth and slack is far from tight, and other factors you've weak productivity growth and global competition, may explain why wage gains remain anemic. Still, firms continue seen an impressive increase in the reports disappointing wage data even if the economy is very close to the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.

rate of involuntary part-time employment remains more than 1 percentage its pre-recession level, and the labor force participation rate remains below the trend.  Moreover, with the public dissatisfaction with the state of the labor I suspect that the current level of the trend participation rate is actually than the staff's estimate, although I'm fairly confident in the trend's downward slope, more reliably. The current point above staff's estimate of its market so widespread, higher which I think can be estimated well necessitate a temporary Eliminating slack along these additional dimensions may decline in the unemployment rate below its longer-run normal level.  For example, pulling discouraged workers back into the labor force may require a period of especially plentiful

September 16-17, 2015

to restructure employment opportunities and strong hiring.  Similarly, firms may be unwilling their operations to use more full-time workers until they encounter greater difficulty filling parttime positions.

imply that the natural rate of unemployment is longer-run value for a time, a temporary undershooting of the longer-run Beyond these dynamics, which effectively likely to run below its level of unemployment could have other advantages, including speeding the return of inflation to 2 percent and even possibly reversing some of the adverse supply-side effects of recent years.

most of you, I anticipate that labor market conditions will the rest of this year and into 2016, helped by continued moderate is not too different from the one I had back in June.  The data then, in fact, have been somewhat stronger than I and-I think this coincides with what I heard around the table-stronger than what GDP growth in the first half of the year has been summer have been solid, while the remarkable contraction in to have bottomed out. Turning to growth, like improve somewhat further over growth in real GDP.  My forecast on spending and production received since expected many of you expected.  Most prominently, real revised up by more than 1 percentage point to 2ยผ percent.  Readings on consumer spending and residential construction into this drilling activity appears the second quarter was most likely a payback for transitory weakness in the first. recent monthly trade data and the expected and weak foreign growth, the staff estimates that real GDP is Nonetheless, I would not describe overall growth as robust.  First, the strong growth in real GDP in And, second, overall growth is being held back by an appreciable and continuing drag generated by the behavior of net exports.  After factoring in the restraint from dollar appreciation likely to expand at an annual rate of only 2 percent in the second half of the year and in 2016.

September 16-17, 2015

real interest rate remains low and shows no obvious signs of rising this year.  That's This stasis would seem to conflict with the story told by continue to fade. One implication of the incoming data and the near-term outlook is that the economy's equilibrium an inference that follows directly from the combination of continued moderate growth and a real funds rate that remains well below zero. our medium-term forecasts, which imply a significant increase in the equilibrium real rate over the next few years as various headwinds restraining economic activity meeting with the recent appreciation of the dollar, especially as it has prices and a modest rise in risk spreads on The explanation, of course, is that one headwind-namely, exchange rate appreciation and weak foreign growth-has strengthened over the past year.  This restraint has increased further since our previous been accompanied by an appreciable fall in stock corporate bonds.

model simulations suggest that these intermeeting financial and international generated by a 50 basis hike in the federal funds rate.  Whatever their implications for the modal outlook, recent and other financial factors, coupled with increased concerns about the that the same thing. FRB/US developments, if they persist, would have demand effects similar to those point movements in the dollar prospects for growth in China and the emerging market economies, certainly suggest downside risks to the U.S. economy have increased to some degree, and several of you have noted the our previous meeting, specifically lower prices and a higher dollar, suggests that the transitory factors currently holding down inflation Turning to inflation, information received since oil are likely to fade a bit more slowly than I previously judged.  For example, the Tealbook now shows overall PCE inflation on a four-quarter basis running at only 1 percent through the first three quarters of next year.  That's down ยผ percent from the July Tealbook.  Nonetheless, I still

September 16-17, 2015

that inflation will gradually return to 2 percent, provided-and this is key-that the labor return to full employment and long-run inflation expectations remain well 2 percent. expect market completes the anchored at economy, I expect that the economy is stay in the general vicinity of full employment over the medium term, assuming adjustments to monetary policy over time.  That said, we can't say with certainty will evolve, But I'm cautiously optimistic that this condition for As I mentioned a moment ago, I anticipate that the labor market will continue to improve in coming quarters and, barring some adverse shock to the likely to appropriate what those adjustments will be, as we do not know how foreign economic conditions how financial conditions will develop, or how rapidly the remaining domestic headwinds will fade, as recent events amply illustrate. meeting our inflation objective will be met.

inflation expectations to be reasonably well anchored and at a level to 2 percent inflation.  That said, the decline in inflation shifts in risk and liquidity premiums.  I said at our previous meeting that my standpoint, a renewed decline in inflation compensation would give me pause, and, in All in all, my confidence that inflation will gradually 2 percent over the medium term has not increased during the intermeeting period. I also judge long-run consistent with the gradual return compensation over the past year concerns me somewhat, even if staff analysis suggests that it's primarily related to from fact, it has declined quite substantially. return to we break now and have dinner, but I would suggest that we begin early.  There is a what's bound to be an to propose that we start off tomorrow morning at briefing. Let me stop there.  I look forward to hearing your views during the policy go-round.  I suggest that press conference tomorrow.  I want to give everybody adequate time for interesting policy discussion.  I would like 8:30, and Thomas will then begin his

[Meeting recessed]

Session September 17

YELLEN.  Good morning, everybody.  I think we're ready to begin our policy CHAIR go-round.  Let me call on Thomas to brief us on the monetary policy alternatives.

LAUBACH. 6   Thank you, Madam Chair.  I will be referring to the handout MR. labeled 'Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.'

the case at each meeting since June, the key issues for your decision for beginning policy normalization have been in an effective way the reasons for the thinking about the likely response of policy to As has been today are whether or not the criteria met and, in either case, how to communicate decision and the Committee's economic developments going forward.

in June, the incoming information on than you anticipated, and is now lower than you expected-developments that clearly Committee's labor market criterion for liftoff.  Inflation as discussed earlier, global economic and financial market developments intermeeting period have led to a tightening of financial conditions and could to economic activity while putting further downward pressure on the near term. Since you submitted economic projections economic activity and the labor market has been stronger the unemployment rate mark further progress on the has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent objective, held down importantly by declines in energy prices and prices of non-energy imports.  In addition, over the pose downside risks inflation in exhibit 1, alternatives A, B, and C provide policy options that that expanding at a moderate pace'-in line with the Committee's that, apart from the continued softness in diminution are quite close to meeting the criterion for liftoff.  In and recognizing that of inflation compensation have moved lower. As summarized on reflect differing assessments of the potential effects of recent economic and financial developments on the outlook.  Starting with alternative B, paragraph 1 states 'economic activity is previously stated expectations-and indicates in net exports, the expansion has been somewhat more broadly based than earlier the year.  The paragraph also presents a more confident assessment of the of economic slack than in previous statements, suggesting that, in the Committee's view, labor market conditions contrast, it casts recent inflation developments less favorably, suggesting that the effects of the declines in energy prices are not yet behind us market-based measures

will moderate rate and labor market indicators will move toward mandatelevels.  In describing the risks to the outlook, alternative B acknowledges many of you cited in your SEP comments on the outlook.  However, that, while the Committee is monitoring developments abroad, Paragraph 2 continues to describe an outlook in which economic activity expand at a consistent that developments abroad 'may restrain [domestic] economic activity somewhat'-a concern that paragraph 2 indicates

this point, tilted the balance of risks to the outlook market appreciably to the downside.  Regarding B indicates that recent global developments 'are further downward pressure on inflation in the near term.'  This the fact that many of you have lowered your for inflation over the near term as well as with the increase in the number risks to inflation to be to the downside.  With this assessment of range for the federal it is not yet reasonably expectation that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the those developments have not, at for economic activity and the labor the outlook for inflation, alternative likely to put assessment seems consistent with projections of you who see the the outlook for inflation, and the decision to leave the target funds rate unchanged, the Committee would convey that confident about its medium term.

the Committee's characterization of the to the outlook for economic activity to the restraint on inflation.  As a result, the if the Committee did not 'soon' see that As summarized in the middle panel, recent information on economic activity and the labor market in alternative A would be the same as in alternative B.  Nonetheless, its description of recent inflation developments would show greater concern, and it would indicate that recent global developments have shifted the risks downside and will impose some additional Committee would signal that it does not expect to begin normalizing policy for some time.  Moreover, alternative A states that incoming information indicating 'that inflation is beginning to move back toward 2 percent,' the Committee would provide additional accommodation to achieve goal within one to two years.

lower panel, alternative C would begin normalizing the level economic background for such a market, it states more definitively that resource slack has for the assessment that labor met the criterion for liftoff by indicating that labor market are 'approaching' mandate-consistent levels.  In evaluating the risks to this Committee would acknowledge the need to monitor developments would not suggest that those developments are likely to be consequential the Committee's assessment of risks to As indicated in the of the federal funds rate.  In summarizing the decision, paragraph 1 offers the perspective that economic growth has been moderate, on average, so far this year, and, after citing some key factors showing further improvement in the labor diminished.  Paragraph 2 provides further support market conditions have indicators outlook, the abroad but for the United States, or that they have altered the outlook.

although inflation is transitory factors holding down inflation 'will dissipate,' and that longer-term expectations-are in place. In alternative C, the Committee would also state that, anticipated to remain low over the near term, policymakers have gained sufficient confidence that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium run to begin to remove policy accommodation.  In paragraph 2, the Committee would state its assessment that the the key determinants of the inflation outlook-continuing improvement in the labor market and stable even if you view the policy choice in alternative C to be circumstances, you may want to comment on whether I should note that premature in the present

that you the July meeting.  Beth and Chris already highlighted in their briefing the paragraph 4 should include the bracketed 'balanced approach' language discussed at language options regarding reinvestment policy.

market and participants' monetary policy like in shown in the top-left panel, market participants' a September liftoff, as derived from federal funds Simon already turbulence in global financial that the perceived odds of are slightly less than 30 percent.  As shown by the table although federal funds futures imply notably lower perceived rate hike than was the case a day before the 1994 and 2004 significantly higher odds than were attached to before the June meeting. Your second exhibit reviews expectations and some factors likely to shape the market reaction to statements the drafts for alternative B or C.  As assessment of the probability of futures, varied significantly over the intermeeting period, as mentioned.  The probability appeared to respond to the markets, policymaker communications, and incoming economic data.  The probability distribution of the timing of liftoff derived from the responses to the Desk's latest Survey of Primary Dealers-shown to the right-suggests policy firming at this meeting in the middle-left panel, odds of an imminent tightening moves, they still indicate liftoff right considerable degree of uncertainty timing of liftoff.  Market participants, on average, place fairly similar odds who individually are quite certain in their views.  However, even among September liftoff was only about 50 percent.  This fact middle-right panel, views are to the Desk's surveys of primary dealers and market participants report increase at this meeting that range from zero to 60 percent, and is similarly high for the December and March meetings. The measures of expectations also signal a about the on liftoff this week, later this year, and next year, as indicated by the fairly uniform distribution of the blue bars in the upper-right panel across the September, December, and later meetings.  This could, in principle, reflect disagreement among survey respondents respondents who selected September as the most likely date of liftoff, the median probability attached to a highlights that, indeed, many of them do not seem to hold strong convictions about any one given date.  Moreover, as shown in the considerably dispersed.  As the distribution of the dots in the leftmost column shows, respondents probabilities for a rate the degree of dispersion

market expectations seems consistent with your data dependence and, in light of federal funds rate, there could be a revision is hard to predict.  A key point, however, is that the overall market response to lift off, but also by the language in the statement, its economic panel, not only remains fairly shallow path might diminish the risk In sum, the current state of communications that have for some time emphasized the mixed signals coming from the labor market and inflation, created optionality for when to move.  At the same time, as discussed in the bottom-left panel, whether or not the FOMC decides to raise the target in investors' policy expectations that may result in a noticeable market reaction-and one that will be shaped not only by the decision about whether Committee's communications, including the projections, and the SEP dots.  The dots, in particular, indicate that your outlook has not changed materially.  The path of the federal funds rate based on the median projection in the SEP, shown in the bottom-right shallow, but also has shifted down a bit.  Such a

market reaction to a statement like alternative C because it conveys the to continue to provide a high degree of accommodation for Similarly, as your projections of the federal funds rate continue to many of you see policy normalization likely to begin later this year, a as clearly keeping interest rate the year on the table and need not lead to a significant change in the of an outsized Committee's intentions some time. indicate that draft statement like alternative B might be read increases later in expected path of policy.

The fact that the federal funds rate rise tantrum.  In addition, technical factors and market dynamics could play an important role If investors surprise, this could amplify interest rate completes my prepared remarks, and I'll be Thank you, Madam Chair.  That happy to take questions.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Does anyone have questions for Thomas?  President CHAIR Rosengren.

I have one quick question on the middle-left panel of exhibit 2, Meeting.'  My memory of the 1994 also that the surprising.  As a result, the 10-year rate went up quite abruptly.  How do you not only the start of tightening, but also the pace of tightening once we begin? MR. ROSENGREN. 'Probability of Tightening the Day before the FOMC tightening cycle was, not only was it a little bit of a surprise when we started, but pace was somewhat think about

In fact, there is, as you may have noticed, a box in Tealbook B that some of these events.  It's interesting that, actually, the pace of months in 1994 wasn't all that rapid, and, as you point out, time.  Here, in my exhibit, I try to focus essentially MR. LAUBACH. looks in greater detail at tightening expected over the first six there was then a substantial surprise over the course of the year.  So that clearly could lead to stronger market responses subsequently over on the liftoff event, not on, say, the six months or a year following that event.

September 16-17, 2015

to downplay potential financial stability challenges for it is still noteworthy that that, of course, was more favorable than else being equal. Now, while I certainly don't want some institutions if such a scenario came to pass, I think happened basically against the backdrop of an economic situation that expected.  So that should be a positive, all

MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you.

YELLEN.  Are there other questions?  President Evans. CHAIR

you talk to provide any information about how the SEP numbers might inform their assessments of the pace of liftoff or anything like that? MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Simon, could you give us any indication-do market commentators or the people funds rate

We added a new question to get numbers back on the SEP medians, the medians we to what will be published today.  They're basically points to be knocked off the medians, and that's what I think the SEP the second part of your question? MR. POTTER. because you're now presenting the medians.  In terms of the dot plot, I'd say that got back from the responses look pretty close expecting about 25 basis shows.  Could you just repeat

Will the dispersion of the dots or anything about the distribution of what MR. EVANS. we give them and how they- many participants have moved liftoff to having read some of the commentary, the notion of four participants putting expected a median, as opposed to taking the median of all 17 My answer was probably a little bit confusing. MR. POTTER.  I think they'll be focused on how 2016.  I'd say that, liftoff in 2016 is probably about what market participants -I know this sounds a little bit strange because I'm talking about your choices here.  There will be focus on dots 4 to 7, and that's where a lot of people look for responses.

MR. EVANS.  No, that's helpful.  We've said things like that before, too.  Thank you.

September 16-17, 2015

CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman.

DUDLEY.  I have a question.  Conditional on not moving today, is currently SEP dots?  This question is for either Thomas or Simon. VICE CHAIRMAN where do you think the probability mass for today would shift, based on how B written and the

The one thing that struck me when reading the dealers' responses was, to assume that, therefore, there is remainder of this year.  So I didn't find in the write-ups MR. LAUBACH. I did not find a lot of evidence for the, as it has come to be called, 'one or none' view-namely, that not moving in September would immediately lead dealers not going to be any move over the anything that pointed in that direction.

Do you think the mass would move to December so that spread acrossVICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. December would go up a lot, or would it be

You're seeing a little bit more weight on the next meeting.  Part of that on how they assess whether there has to be a scheduled press conference for a move October.  And then some mass will go into next year, and that's basically because are a lot of things that can happen regarding to move further out, I think. MR. POTTER. will depend at the October meeting.  What I think Thomas was saying is, we definitely expect mass to go to December.  We're unsure, and it might depend on the press conference, exactly where it goes relative to stuff can happen over the next few months.  There the debt limit that will push people

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Fischer.

what will happen to the market's views depends very conference and what guidance we give for the coming MR. FISCHER.  I would guess that heavily on what is said in the press months.  So I'm not sure we get a very good guess independent of that.

September 16-17, 2015

Yes, but there's also one market commentary I saw, which indicated that, was given the transcript, the statement, the SEP, and the transcript of the press could still not guess what the market reaction would be. It's useful to be humble when trying to predict what might happen, whichever MR. POTTER. if everyone conference in advance, most people [Laughter] outcome is chosen.

Does anyone have other questions for Thomas?  Okay.  Seeing none, would like to start off today's policy go-round by recommending to the alternative B and keep the federal funds rate target range unchanged. CHAIR YELLEN. with your indulgence, I Committee that we adopt Let me explain the basis for this recommendation.

that a good case can be made for moving today.  The data that we've received July meeting on the labor market and domestic spending have been strong, arguably on a solid course, and the labor unemployment. I recognize since our stronger than we expected.  Domestic spending appears to be market has continued to improve, with the unemployment rate declining into the central tendency of the longer-run normal rate of momentum to overcome the slightly greater-thanto the behavior of the external sector and the tightening of financial way below our target, but there's no news there.  We expected that to be due to transitory factors, particularly oil prices labor market continuing to improve and survey inflation expectations remaining stable, we should eventually see upward pressure effect of policy, so we need to move in a There may well be enough domestic anticipated drag due conditions.  Inflation is the case.  A significant portion of that shortfall is and the dollar.  Although core inflation, even abstracting from the depressing effect of import prices, is running below our objective, with the measures of on inflation, returning it to target.  There are lags in the timely fashion to avoid overshooting our 2 percent objective.

We've consistently argued that the significance of a decision to make a small upward adjustment in the funds rate range should not be overblown.  What matters is the path of the funds rate, and we've said that shallow.

Perhaps our credibility is at stake if we don't get on with as though we're overreacting to market volatility.  I see this as the case raising rates. Conceivably, raising the of households and businesses, spurring rather than retarding domestic spending, and perhaps the incessant market focus on the timing of liftoff has itself become a source of uncertainty that's roiling the job.  We may seem for rates today, however.  And, in the final analysis, I think that we've waited a bit too 2 percent inflation of moving too soon. I also see a case for not raising that case is stronger.  Perhaps most important, my judgment that we should stay on hold reflects my assessment of the balance of risks.  In particular, should it turn out long to raise rates, thereby raising the odds that inflation overshoots our target, or that we're forced to move rates up less gradually than we'd prefer-I see those risks as less severe than the risks

And the benefit would be more rapid return of inflation to 2 percent.  Indeed, this is a reason why it makes sense to continue setting as a condition for a first increase in the federal funds improvement in the labor market.

felt this way for some time, as you all know, but I haven't been hell-bent that it's going to be difficult to persuade me to support further delay. MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I think now's the time to raise the federal funds rate target.  I've on dissenting.  I'll be listening to this morning's discussion with great interest, but, at this point, my sense is appropriate level of the rate.  There are a number of approaches to assessing the appropriate real Basic economic theory tells us that a sustained always tight in the data, but the underlying reasoning strongly suggests that the rate we've been seeing. Our decisions about policy are inevitably decisions about the short-term real interest rate, but I'll start with consumption growth. increase in consumption growth should be associated with higher real interest rates.  Granted, this connection isn't a negative 1.2 percent real interest rate is unlikely to be appropriate for an economy with persistent consumption growth at

Indeed, a range of attempts at quantification yield real interest rate that are relatively markedly higher than the actual current level of the real federal funds rate of negative as reported in the Tealbook.

But the error bands encompass the Laubach-Williams figure, so it's a The Laubach-Williams estimate that we've been meetings is Reserve Bank of exercise, one that's somewhat more agnostic about identifying assumptions and yields an estimate of very similar estimate.

the longer-run funds rate is 1.25 percent, and implementations that they report on in Tealbook B.  The call the equilibrium real funds rate is too low now.  Taken together, I think they argue strongly for a rate increase. The Tealbook's estimate of what they call this is what's used in the Taylor rule Tealbook's FRB/US-model-based estimate of what they now positive 0.47 percent.  Taking any one of these measures as a guide, short-term real interest rates are rate policy is to compare that have been successful for us in the past. behavior is through algebraic policy rule of several of these, and all but one now support raising the nominal funds rate.  The a sense, is A related and complementary approach to assessing interest current interest rate settings with patterns of behavior The standard approach to summarizing our past formulas, such as the various versions of the Taylor rule.  Tealbook B, as I said, lists the predictions one that does not support an increase in rates is the first-difference rule, which, in

Such beliefs provide essential foundational support for this stability for granted.

to delay, we would be departing even further from the pattern of that has served us well in the past.  The historical record strongly suggests that such the likelihood of bad outcomes.

We should remember, however, that the later, growth and inflation were rising, and the moved too late and too little in that The prospect of inflationary risks may seem remote right now.

might reply that because conditions might change, why not just wait and see?  That market volatility appears to have the resolution of uncertainty can be a trap, however.  There's policy in ways that we later regret, and we should be mindful of this. One strategy often seems attractive, particularly when financial increased uncertainty.  Waiting for always something new around the corner about which one could be uncertain, or, to quote Governor Fischer quoting a former colleague of his, 'It's never clear next time.  It's just unclear in a different way.'  As I noted yesterday, we have a history of letting financial market developments affect our response is that we know that policy affects the economy with lags, so we expansion may have been disappointing when compared with when compared with currently realistic assessments of our It's time to recognize The deeper should strive to position ourselves in a way that balances future risks.

I'm concerned the Committee's communication has contributed and is contributing concerned we have allowed our mantra of 'data dependence' to approach past several months, however, data too little basis for the public to grasp what will drive the Committee's decisions in the the need for an attempt to achieve greater consensus on what will both rate decisions of the Committee as we go forward and then find a way to consensus to the public.  My concern is that, without firming up our guidance, guidance status quo will work at cross-purposes with attaining our objectives.  We a guessing game in the markets that could contribute to unsettled more generally, requires I'm concerned about our approach to forward guidance, and I'd like to offer some thoughts in that to market volatility.

And I'm going to go back to June 2005, when I was one of the briefers of the housing bubble.  You may disagree with the word 'bubble,' of what that meant for one of the presenters as a member of the staff of the Federal Reserve San Francisco.  I remember then Vice Chairman Geithner asking me during a break, It's mid-2005.  House prices are, by our own estimates, 25 or 30 in place.  Do we raise interest rates and prick the bubble?  Or At this point, I want to respond to President Kocherlakota's question about what it means to boil over. FOMC.  We were talking about the but house prices were very elevated in June 2005.

And Let me put that in context.  Today, according to a standard measure, the house-price-torent ratio is level between 1980 and 2000, the standard price-to-rent ratio is about house prices are rising very dramatically today.

However, I do think it is important, picking up on the comments of President Lockhart, that we do keep all future meetings live, including October.

alternative B.  I did not view close call.  With little time to process recent financial market movements a more effect on variables we care about. MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support this decision today as a and international concerns, we need more time to understand whether there's been significant underlying change in economic fundamentals.  The first footnote in Tealbook A makes clear that the economic effect of delaying a tightening by a meeting or two would have a de minimis at this meeting, with excessive volatility and using new tools to get us off the a much more complicated start to our tightening cycle.  It also risks the start of a more significant global slowdown, which is not in my is now a more elevated risk.  Reasonable risk management leads me to want Tightening zero lower bound, risks possibility of tightening at the modal forecast but to see more data before acting.

I do view the time to raise rates as being near.  While the U-3 unemployment is not a sufficient statistic to summarize labor market conditions, it also should not be been pretty strong this year, and broader measures of slackwe've underestimated how quickly That said, rate ignored.  Employment growth has U-4, U-5, and U-6-have also improved significantly.  As

September 16-17, 2015

it is possible that we will face much tighter labor markets less delay in reaching unemployment rates would decline, sooner than I have in my forecast.  If that were to happen, I would expect our inflation target.

the recent market volatility and the uncertainty about the inflation forecast, I it begins, be quite gradual.  A risk to waiting too long in my SEP forecast.  For example, more rapid adjustment to In light of would prefer that our tightening, whenever to lift off is that we may need to tighten more quickly than is waiting until next year risks a more pronounced decline in unemployment than is in my modal forecast and a more rapid return to 2 percent inflation than we currently envision.  Under those conditions, we would be caught behind the curve and need to make a policy.  I'd prefer to avoid such a circumstance.

they coincide with an SEP release and a turbulence does not leave much trace in the data going forward, it seems to me to begin a gradual tightening process relatively soon. I would like each of the meetings, whether planned press conference, to be live.  If the domestic and global economy is slowing down, there will be no need to tighten.  However, if labor markets continue to improve and the recent financial market prudent a couple of quick comments on the reinvestment discussion.  I didn't comment should provide forward guidance.

In a nutshell, we are making a decision today that likely quantitatively small effects on the U.S. economy emanating from the RMB depreciation decision.  This is not a good basis for U.S. monetary policy strategy.  Some are claiming that global commodity price declines are the driving factor here, but, on balance, this is a bullish factor for the United States, not my concerns is that we are sending a very muddled message about our reaction general nature of the economic situation has One of function.  We have in many ways become very discretionary in our policy choices, citing different factors on different days, even when the not changed appreciably.

to learn that there's been a sudden shift in sentiment running monetary policy with heavy employment gaps.  I actually think Concerning inflation, I'm delighted on the Committee toward strict inflation targeting-that is, emphasis on inflation and little or no emphasis on output or this would be a reasonable way to proceed and could lead to reasonably good policy in the

September 16-17, 2015

not enjoyed as much popularity in the past as it has recently.  However, is a problem with what I'm calling strict inflation-targeting approaches in the current target.  This would be a good reason to be at perhaps a 2 percent policy to the inflation gap.  In other words, a relatively small inflation gap implies a percent federal funds rate.  What that means is, as inflation rises, the United States, but it has there circumstances.  Strict inflation targeting says that the reason we are still at the zero lower bound is that inflation is below rate, still well below long-run normal levels.  But it is not a good reason to be near zero on the policy rate, 350 basis points below normal levels.  That suggests a very high elasticity of the federal funds rate lot of accommodation-a 0 federal funds rate will, at least if you are taking this approach, rise very quickly, and that is not what the Committee is saying.

Governor Fischer's assessment from yesterday on the idea that temporary many have said around here.  As these abate, a strict exactly this process that will lead to perceptions that the I agree with factors are influencing inflation, as inflation-targeting approach would suggest a rapid increase in the policy rate.  We're evidently not planning to do that, so it's Committee is far behind the proverbial curve.

a poor decision today, and I just want to think about what the fallout will be making a I see four consequences.  First, I 'late and fast' strategy and away from perception in markets, which is already there, will be that until we're forced into action.  It also suggests that the Committee if necessary-or at least that's the way we're I see this as and how the Committee has to manage going forward.  Even though I think we're not good decision here, we can make good decisions in the future. think that the Committee will be viewed as shifting to a an 'early and gradual' strategy.  The the Committee will not move is perhaps more willing to scramble to catch up, weighing that risk.

September 16-17, 2015

late-and-fast strategy, combined with an undefined reaction move faster.  In addition, it is not that clear what the Committee might react to, in making our policy decision. Second, this shift toward a function, will mean even more volatility in the future due to uncertainty about Fed policy than we would otherwise have.  What we're saying, essentially, is that when the Committee moves, it may have to because we're taking a very discretionary approach to our policy and a very eclectic approach to what variables we want to cite there's more risk now of an outsized increase in rates at some point in the the moves of 50 or 75 basis points that were made in 1994.  If you're going to to possibly be ready to move more quickly than I Committee is currently ready for.  Markets will sense this, and this will create in financial markets. Third, I think future, not unlike play the late-and-fast strategy, then you've got think the additional uncertainty

I think there will be a continued and exacerbated mismatch between market expectations about future policy.  The Committee will now put out its but those in the markets that think the Committee will never into the future.  So there will be more of a gap the FOMC expects regarding monetary policy and what the market expects. can't persist indefinitely.  They have to be reconciled at some point, and that process to additional volatility in markets and is part of what was going on here, I think, during the Finally, expectations and FOMC SEP.  It will have a policy rate path, move will be emboldened to move even further now between what Those gaps leads summer.

moving the funds rate up at this meeting.  The Committee has laid out two criteria for liftoff-some percent over the medium term.  In my view, those conditions have been met. MS. MESTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I believe there's a strong case for federal further improvement in labor markets and reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to our target of 2

The inflation criterion for liftoff is appropriately based on the expected path of inflation and not on its current level.  No doubt inflation has been running below our goal of 2 percent, but the effects of last summer's oil price decline and fall in passing through to the headline inflation numbers.  This, combined with the fact that market has stable even in the face of commodity price declines, should give us more confidence in our inflation forecast.  Starting normalization before we reach our dual-mandate we want to minimize the risk than we're currently anticipating.

But we've taken out insurance against rates consistent equilibrium interest rate has been rising-in this Tealbook it's now 0.47 percent.

over six uncertainty surrounding the decision.  The fact that there's in the markets at liftoff.  I don't I believe that Chair Yellen's insightful leadership of the Committee has prepared the public for liftoff.  In the current environment, after keeping the funds rate at zero for years, I would expect some residual not unanimity across market participants and forecasters that liftoff will occur at this particular meeting doesn't deter me.  Most are still expecting a rate hike this year, and a resolution of some policy uncertainty might actually be viewed favorably.  In addition, no matter how well we have prepared and signaled such a change, I'd expect some volatility think we should be too bothered by that, either.

more is if, on liftoff, the public's expectation about the path of than the path we're currently anticipating. each meeting thereafter What would concern me policy after liftoff changes and becomes much steeper In other words, might liftoff be read as the beginning of rate increases at so that we have a steep path going up?

the Committee anticipates that economic conditions will a way that warrants keeping the funds rate below its longer-run level for some time. the message of a gradual path is coming through there is some risk that the act of liftoff may appreciably change communications at liftoff will be sufficient to mitigate The Chair has emphasized that evolve in This certainly shows up in our SEP.  But the market path implied by market data is considerably shallower than in the SEP, which suggests that loud and clear.  Thus, while policy expectations, I believe appropriate this risk.

September 16-17, 2015

some very difficult waters over the past at a favorable alignment of expectations of a rate increase and the data that support communicate the rationale component of a liftoff. Chair Yellen and the Committee have navigated year, as the start of normalization is near.  With considerable effort, we've reached a point which there is such an increase.  I don't believe this is something we should take for granted.  Current economic circumstances are very favorable in terms of being able to for action and post-liftoff policy, and careful communication is a crucial successful are risks to moving.  But there are also risks to not moving, including having more aggressively later on if we delay too much further.  Action is going to send a may not see such favorable conditions for communications for the day and act.  Of course, I do understand that this Yes, there to move signal, but so will inaction.

Given my economic forecast, I continue to hold the position am not adamant that it of energy prices and price than later, and that the process should be gradual.  At the to see improvements in the months, the Committee will move to raise rates. The recent turbulence in financial markets and the softening pressures in general probably make this meeting less than optimal for liftoff, although I expect these are temporary headwinds.  It is, however, my strong belief that we should begin our normalization process sooner rather least, the statement language should make clear that if we continue labor market over the next couple of

I'm becoming concerned that we treating every bump in the economic road as a reason for delay, with the monetary policy moves further and further from what can reasonably be viewed as wait in anticipation that all signs point in the same direction, the more very aggressive, and I worry about Earlier liftoff to maintain will find ourselves effect that normal.

So my preference would be that process of removing accommodation and address these potential spillover the expected path of accommodation, versus delaying much further too long the start of the process of removing accommodation at While a lower unemployment rate, of course, is desirable, it has the create unhealthy imbalances if it's supported by artificially accommodative financial reversed or unwound when policy eventually normalizes, as it a hard landing, which, to me, means excess more normal policy is put into place.  In my experience, the economy approaches our best In my view, delaying for this stage carries a cost. potential to conditions.  Such conditions maintained for too long may encourage investment and borrowing decisions that cannot easily be must.  This increases the chances, in my view, of investment, inventory buildup, and financial asset valuations that are more likely to lead to negative economic effects later when imbalances like these are often not obvious until after the fact, and they need not be accompanied by above-target inflation.  So I would say that, on the upside, prudent risk management dictates that we begin the process of scaling back accommodation as estimate of potential.

written at this meeting, though, because I believe it is prudent to use the next several weeks or months to confirm that conditions for liftoff are allowing us to act in October or December.

And if we start moving rates up 2 percent could risk de-anchoring inflationary expectations, with profound longer run. I support policy, I too soon, I fear the FOMC could lose credibility on its commitment to a symmetric objective.  This loss consequences in the with regard to their inflation targets, and they may well be facing more difficult policy choices.

Indeed, if we don't keep an appropriately When I consider sustainably get high level of accommodation in place, we risk this cycle ending with inflation topping out below 2 percent.  That would certainly jeopardize faith in our target.

But it turns out you were much more in your own concern about overshooting, and I think others have been today as well. There's inflation at an appropriate pace.  I'm Committee about a modest overshooting of our inflation target.  Madam Chair, I will say that in my initial prepared explicit

that many participants' SEP forecasts are trying to thread the needle to get to the only way I can SEP policy rate paths, at least given my outlook.  I infer that these paths seven that time isn't I sense 2 percent without any risk of overshooting.  With inflation so very low, that's rationalize some of our reflect a serious aversion to PCE inflation heading to, say, 2ยฝ percent.  But after six or years of inflation averaging 1ยฝ percent, whether we briefly touch 2 percent during really relevant.  And with forecasts for several more years below target, we should be very nervous about advocating policies that seek to eliminate any chance of 2ยฝ percent inflation.

exceeding 2 percent inflation will risk signaling that our price is a ceiling and not a symmetric target.  It also risks us joining other central banks that Outsized concerns over objective are struggling with the consequences of not sufficiently defending their inflation objectives from below and of ignoring the added risk emanating from the zero lower bound.

My SEP submission delays liftoff both to build us time to better assess the outlook before making a policy move.  At the funds rate range at 75 to 100 basis points.

Again, the way to get to within a reasonable period of time, or at all, is to make sure you give yourself a to 2 percent.

Finally, I think our medium-term policy focus should be on communicating our commitment to a 2 percent symmetric PCE inflation objective.  Like President Lockhart, I feel that will react to incoming clarifying when liftoff will take with respect be quite valuable for supporting the on this score if we focus most of our central portions of the chart.

the heavy emphasis on data dependence is injecting substantial are affecting our assessment of the outlook rather than inadvertently sending Second, I believe uncertainty into markets and is too backward looking.  So, in addition to data dependence, monetary policy needs to emphasize being forward looking.  We should place more emphasis on how incoming data a message that we're responding to the most recent data points.

policy to align the medium-term outlook for our prices and employment with our longer-term objectives.  Now, when I say the risks to that outlook as well.  As President Evans emphasized, are all asymmetrically on the downside at this stage because of the zero lower to respond effectively to those risks. I will start with what President George just said, which is that the Committee should do more both internally and externally to emphasize the need to condition monetary policy on the outlook.  We should always be seeking to make goal variables of term 'outlook,' I mean to include those risks really bound and our inability to be able many around the table is a desire to incorporate other considerations the outlook into our thinking.  President Lacker started off by talking about how the had given very good outcomes for us in the past.  Embedded in the Taylor rule is a to have interest rates close to their long-run normal level. What I heard from besides Taylor rule sense of the desirability

We want to be And, as President Evans suggested, taking into account the closeness might want to be willing to have some overshooting in the term in terms of our modal inflation outlook, just to guard against those downside risks. President Lockhart 2 percent over the medium term.  I think we want to be aligned between our medium-term outlook and our long-run goals.  We actually back to 2 percent. to the effective lower bound, we medium

I want to offer that the Committee-again, as President medium-term outlook and its 2004-06 pace, which I believe was actually viewed as fairly measured, would deliver a Several people talked about being concerned about disliking rapid increases rates.  Again, this is introducing a non-goal-oriented consideration into your policy decisionmaking.  To offer some context, when we're rates, we're baseline in the SEP is 25 basis points per quarter.  I think the Evans mentioned-would have a better alignment between its long-run objectives by waiting and then raising rates at a slightly faster pace.  Something more like the better outcome.

meetings and the decisionmaking around liftoff are really critical not just it's going to affect the economy, but also in the strategic framework of how the Committee is going to think about policy. collection of Taylor-like rules.  I suggested yesterday had served the Committee extremely poorly during the course of the recovery. The next few for the course of policy in the near term and how terms of setting up We continue to be overly influenced by a that this in that discussion about November 2009, that was not a meeting.  It was a meeting in which the Committee had terminated QE1, and was thinking 8s in terms of the and the hawkish side in the 9s.  I was there.  I was on the Committee at the so this is about self-reflection and self-criticism as much as anything else. To try to clarify one of my points QE about, how do we best time the removal of accommodation-specifically, the increase of interest rates-with the improvement in the economy so as to best support the recovery?  The debate within the Committee, shaped by Taylor rules, had the dovish side in the unemployment rate time,

an unduly slow recovery.  We do not want to have that happen again.  The This is about the problem with our framework that was in place before 2008 imprisoning the Committee into

that happen again is by conditioning the policy decisions now about liftoff along the lines that President Evans has suggested. way you don't have and afterward much more firmly on the outlook for prices and employment and by building in, I think, risk protections drawn, Madam Chair, to A.  I do not think that this is the time to be considering liftoff.  I look at what's been to how financial markets are considering the credibility of our target. meaning to be overly critical, as I listen to this debate, I can understand why financial because there's just a comfort level with, only happens if we the target in the 1980s.  That's how we have to get there.  It's If we remove accommodation now, with inflation running as low as it is as long as it is to get back to target, we are not sending the right message I look at what's happening in the world, and we look at all of the experiences countries have had in trying to escape the zero lower bound.  And I am alternative happening with regard Without markets are doubting the credibility of our target, 'Eventually, we have to get back to 2 percent.  It's got to happen.'  That make decisions to make it happen.  That is how we get credibility for our target.  That's how Paul Volcker got credibility for through our decisions. and projected to take about credibility.

is It'll allow us to respond more effectively to shocks going forward, as at some normal level.  The only thing that should mean for this Committee is that we are hitting our price and employment I am drawn to alternative A.  I think that will set us up better to have a framework that explicitly goal oriented. opposed to putting weight on having interest rates 'normal level' objectives over the medium term.

The first, that there be further progress in the strengthening of the labor members of the Committee believe with reasonable confidence that the will reach 2 percent in the medium term.  As I explained yesterday, I believe we've is 2 percent, we can say that we've met those criteria. Broadly speaking, two sets of views Chair in her opening remarks this morning.  The first set of views starts from the two criteria we specified criteria we set out were, market and, second, that inflation rate met those criteria.  To justify that view, one has to explain why, when the actual inflation rate so far from simple-that the current low inflation rate is due largely to declines in The explanation is the price of oil and to the appreciation of the exchange rate, both of which are temporary.  By the calculation I described yesterday-which takes into account not only the difference between the

September 16-17, 2015

but also the indirect effects on the inflation rate of the is actual and core PCE price deflators, decline in the price of oil and of the exchange rate-the underlying inflation rate approximately 1.6 percent at present.

end by making the case that we can delay raising the federal if current conditions continue, we should raise To be sure, those two criteria are only necessary conditions for raising the interest rate. I'll say more on that later, for I'll funds rate beyond the end of this month, but that the federal funds rate before the end of the year.

set of views starts from the fact that there is no inflation in sight, and that we the interest rate even though, in the view of many, the labor market is close to rate of unemployment.  Rather, we should stay at the effective lower bound, possibly to decline below the natural rate, and raise the interest rate only deal with the inflation rate, which, if we were writing for the is 'when we see the whites of the eyes of inflation.' The second should not raise the natural allow the unemployment rate when we clearly need to newspapers, we'd say should wait before raising the federal funds rate either because rate of unemployment has fallen to well below 5 percent or because we can allow the that are not yet at what we think is their normal condition-we're rate, the long-term unemployment ratio, and part-time the interest rate and move toward the natural rate of unemployment from below.  I think it's view, the explicit adoption of such an approach would be In this view, we can and the natural actual rate of unemployment to fall below the natural rate and thus contribute to dealing with aspects of the labor market talking about the participation employment for economic reasons.  When we reach reasonable levels of those variables, we can raise important to note that, at least in my widely viewed as a change in the FOMC's monetary policy strategy.

York Stock Exchange on August 24, going to have sharper, changes in prices in the stock markets as electronic trading develops further. Now, both of these views have merit.  The choice between them has been complicated by developments abroad.  Just over a month ago, on August 11, China devalued its rather clumsily and after Even the governor of the Chinese central bank described it thus.  The Chinese exchange rate move created shock waves, one of which arrived at the New when the Dow Jones index declined in the morning by over 1,000 points and then closed down by 588 points, about 3.8 percent.  By the way, I wonder whether we're not more rapid before the Chinese devaluation, began to draw the attention of markets in the in Latin America.  So are some countries in Southeast Asia the United Kingdom's economy is moving ahead well, the expectation that the Indian grow this year at over 7 percent, and the possibility that India is going to be the Subsequently, emerging market and developing-country problems, many of which had started well industrialized world.

What are we to do?  Well, the choice In light of the realization that there were other difficulties in the global economy, I can support not interest rate a series of observations on our discussion that I can't figure out where to put in logical place.  So I'll talk about them now, and, if they're out of order, you'll I've got this statement at a

September 16-17, 2015

and let me know what they are so that I can improve this in First, we're all very concerned about the problems in foreign economies.  When I effects think the Tealbook forecast was made in full knowledge of the situation the staff attempted to take into account the effects of the external situation on the U.S. economy. make the appropriate corrections retrospect. listen to them, they sound much larger than what I found in the Tealbook in terms of their on the U.S. economy.  I in the global economy, and we can be sure that quantitative it appropriate that, besides expressing our worries about foreign economies to be.  These are, admittedly, early days, but the is that those effects will not derail the impressive recovery of the United States' I do believe and describing links between their economies and ours, we should try to make a quantitative estimate of how large those effects are likely evidence so far economy since 2009, where, in particular, the labor market has continued to strengthen at a remarkably steady-indeed, impressive-pace.

going to make is that one keeps hearing about this 'unduly slow' don't think it's unduly slow.  I think it's remarkable, in fact, what has happened to If you're thinking about GDP, that hasn't recovered.  But the difference for that. The next comment I'm recovery.  I the unemployment rate. between what's happening to labor and what's happening to GDP is productivity, and I don't think monetary policy is responsible is.  That is largely a result of two large also tend to forget that we have a as a result of the enlarged balance sheet, as the discussion yesterday of I have a few other points.  We keep saying we will look through supply shocks, but we don't.  We keep talking about how low the inflation rate supply shocks, and we'd better remember that we look through supply shocks when one day we find inflation above 2 percent because of supply shocks.

It raised the rate from 50 basis points to 75 basis points.  It did that because they reached about effect of the Federal Reserve's QE, which advice-when the circumstances changed, we changed policy. I would like discussion. know one of those examples very well.  The Bank of Israel was the first central bank to raise interest the economy was growing and inflation was above the target range, largely due to the fact that housing prices were rising rapidly.  It stayed on this path of raising rates until 3 percent, when the European crisis developed and the had begun after the Bank of Israel had raised the rate, began to become obvious.  That is to say, they followed Keynes's

I regard the proof that if you not recognizing the dynamics of what was economy, where 2009, as was mentioned yesterday, looked like the end than that and we had to do more.  I could say the United States reversed It invented QE.  So it also cut interest rates.

First, monetary policy will continue to be very we start moving, for we are not about to lift off vertically.  We are about I recommend that we think very hard about the highly respected economists and policymakers that raising the federal make our first move, monetary policy will be be a surprise to no one, and many around the that this change should come soon.  Some in the emerging market countries even of saving time, I won't reasons, with apologies expansionary even after to begin the process of gradual normalization. assertions made by even funds rate at this meeting or in the near future could be an epochal mistake and realize that they're almost certain to be wrong.

If the Federal Reserve sends a well-reasoned signal that we think the U.S. mentioned as a Second, we've now held the nominal interest years and nine months.  In so doing, we're sending a signal that the economy is still extremely far from being normal.  The interest rate aside, the economy is now strong enough to begin normalizing, we would be providing an important boost to confidence of businesses and households.  That's something the Chair possibility in her opening statement.  The improvement in confidence would have a positive effect on spending and job creation.

that we've set out to meet will enhance the credibility of the FOMC.  Conversely, if we delay despite meeting these criteria, market participants and Fed watchers will not any argument that's made on the basis of Third-and this is also an important point-beginning normalization when we've met the criteria continue to know what to make of our communications, and our credibility will suffer.  Now, there is a statement that has recently been made that practically

examine arguments that really matters for a central bank, particularly for the better what we intend to do.  One ways to achieve that is by doing what we have said we will do. credibility is bound to be wrong.  I think that, while we should always rely on credibility with suspicion, credibility most important central bank in the world.  In this regard, I have considerable sympathy with President Lockhart's view that the markets need to understand of the best decisions we make this year are going to affect the economy next year and in foreign economies stabilizes-note that I am not saying 'if foreign economies just 'if their situation stabilizes'-and if, as the SEP suggests, most of us agree that whether to start it in October or There is an attraction to the idea of going in October, because, if the objective that we can, indeed, make decisions times a year, not just four times-at press conference meetings.

Chair has said, both externally and internally.  At her June press a way of thinking about when, whether, and how we are going to raise I want to recall what the conference, she laid out

She made reference to the SEP, which, as a factual matter, indicated that most, though not would be appropriate to in the year.  She scrupulously stayed away from any reference to a particular rates. all, participants in the FOMC, under expected conditions, thought that it raise rates later month.

There was always some formalistic stuck in there, but we all know what happens with the press when you talk about a In our July meeting, the Chair at one point said, 'Opining in public on the exact the first move, in my own view, not process, but ultimately, diminishing the effectiveness and credibility of our policy.' went on to say, 'So my suggestion for all of us is liftoff.' talking about when they thought liftoff caveat particular month.  And that's exactly what happened.

intent was to try to move public expectations toward a September liftoff.  At to shift toward an expectation that September was the month.  Then, with the China developments, there was renewed speculation about going to do-with that outcome, there is, indeed, some risk that some there say, 'Oh, they were ready to go, but then you had this markets.'  I that risk would be as high as it is had everyone followed what the it would not look as though we had done a instability arises, we don't do it. Maybe their that juncture, understandably, sentiment began going to be whether that would, in fact, be the case.

lines.  But it's because, I think, we didn't follow the guidance that she I realize that any plea for self-discipline and collegiality is probably not going to have much effect, but I think this is an instance in which we do run some risk of someone saying something along those gave both in her June press conference and just among us in the July meeting.

I'd looked at been, myself included, about to be in a different place.  I did expect to be on the cusp of a way I thought the economy would go.  But that isn't the way was likely I would be for a rate increase in September, although I was open to the possibility that some Turning to the substance of this decision today, as I mentioned yesterday: our SEPs for the past few years, seeing how wrong we had all where both inflation and unemployment were going to be.  So I went back to look at what I said during the economic and monetary policy go-rounds late last year, and I confirmed my own memory that I actually expected us decision to raise rates, based on the things have turned out, and I wanted to explain why, as I said in July, I didn't think it that things would happen in the interim that would change my mind.

take the China problems to get me to the position I already-actual inflation, both core and headline, is Market measures of inflation compensation have actually drifted down a little bit, expectations, on which we put so much refer to the transitory factors, and, surely, both the dollar and oil prices themselves at less effect on inflation. I guess what I'm saying is, it didn't am taking today.  People have alluded to this not moving in the direction of our target, and it hasn't started moving there over the past couple of meetings. as people noticed.  Even the talismanic inflation emphasis-they're still there, but, even at the edge, there's been a little shakiness as well. People some point are going to start to have

September 16-17, 2015

almost everybody on this during that period.  This is the old Roseanne It's always something to escape the observation that amount-than we all were projecting it But I do think it's worth noting that it's been several years now that there's been some reason why inflation is held down, contrary to the expectations that Committee, to a greater or lesser degree, has had Roseannadanna line on Saturday Night Live: 'It's always something.' that fades, but then something else comes in.  It's a little hard inflation has been running lower-and by a significant would be moving a year or two or three ago.

We talk a lot about what's 'normal' or 'natural.'  Those are dangerous words in is still normal or natural today. In that context, I think one has to start asking the question, 'Is something different going on here?' analysis because they can be a substitute for analysis-just to say, 'Well, we know where the end point is.  It's where we were before.'  Sometimes, as a matter of everyday life, that's probably the best way to proceed.  But when you come to consequential decisions after a period in which some very unusual things have happened, it's probably a good idea to ask yourself whether yesterday's normal or yesterday's natural think of things that, 30 years ago, were that we today regard as aberrant.  Since coming here, formally, I've tried to read a lot of monetary policy the fact that, over time-and I'm not just talking about the Federal generally have made many mistakes, both to a hawkish and a dovish of the fact that they didn't appreciate that the external conditions in economic Quite apart from economics, I believe we can all regarded as normal and natural, but because I wasn't schooled in this stuff history.  I'm struck by Reserve-central banks outcome, because and financial markets had changed.

Now, you can't do that every meeting, and you shouldn't do it every meeting.  But we've been through this period when the economy has defied our predictions both with respect to

September 16-17, 2015

unemployment and with respect to inflation, and it's done so consistently.  Under those circumstances, I think you at least have to start asking yourself that question.

has led me to what I characterized yesterday as my has to be at 2 percent, for heaven's sake.  That's a That's not it.  It's looking for some evidence that we are actually moving in that I surely don't have some substitute paradigm for thinking about inflation and monetary policy today, but it's that perspective that show-me attitude-not that inflation caricature. direction.

If I were sitting on the U.K. MPC right now, I would to inch up a couple of tenths more; and a nice 2.9 percent are risks to moving when I'm not seeing enough As I said yesterday, it feel quite differently-with above-trend growth; inflation having moved up to, I believe, 1.6 percent and people seeming to expect it wage gain.  Frankly, a year ago, I thought we'd be around there right now and I really would feel quite differently.  But we're not there, and there momentum to give us some assurance that we've got a bit of a buffer.

to get to 2.'  For me, it wouldn't even have to be headline or core inflation or wages-it's got to be something, though, and and haven't for a while. It's not a matter of, 'Oh, there's so much uncertainty.'  Of course, there's always uncertainty.  And it's not a matter of saying, 'We've got necessarily that's what I'm not seeing right now

I looked through the 2011 spike in commodity prices, so I know that to tell ourselves we're going to keep looking through things, even though it's I want to say that people look through things.  But what I worry about is, we continue to look through everything, and we continue different things year after year.  So that's really the perspective.

and said about why it's not just liftoff, but the path of interest rates and all of that-the I'll offer a couple of concluding comments.  First, I fully understand what the Chair others have

September 16-17, 2015

matter.  If David into the models, it doesn't seem to matter that much.  But I think it does inflation and around the first move will be heavily scrutinized and interpreted. Chair and Governor Fischer both said it in the go-round today.  But liftoff does just puts 25 basis points matter because it's going to communicate to the world how we are thinking about our willingness to do things when inflation is where it is.  I don't think we can get fact that the in the face about will immediately turn to, 'When are they going to move next?  And how frequently Do they have a timetable?  Every other meeting?  Every meeting?  Every meeting?  What is their presumption here?'  So I don't going to escape those issues. Second, let's not fool ourselves, either.  We can talk until we're blue how, 'Oh, we want a shallow path.  We're going to do one move, and we're going to sit back.' Speculation are they going to do it? third meeting?  Every fourth and a half think we're

with is, it would be good if, even internally, we could get some externally.  Where I differ, for the reason I in the articulation that we're reasonably confident that inflation is there. is enough progress here or there.  But either there is or there isn't.  I think that, to many down to, 'Look, we just think we're may not be irrational, highly subjective, and it's hard as a basis for coming together on something that we be worth the effort. Finally, on language, I agree with President Lockhart's top-level point but disagree the second point.  The top-level point more agreement and then possibly communicate it said a minute ago, is The improvement in the labor market is a more or less objective thing.  You can argue whether there people, the reasonable confidence about inflation has come close enough to eliminating slack that it's going to start happening.'  That but it's still can agree on, even internally, as a trigger.  But I definitely think it would the data issue, we do not want the world thinking, 'Their decision turns on whether the next Regarding President George's comments, I couldn't agree more.  With respect to point

To me, it makes sense to defer inflation picture and the global situation settle down. The Committee has guided markets to expect incoming data.  Those data have been, on balance, perhaps a have additional disinflationary forces arriving, albeit ones we view as transitory, and a higher risk of a global slowdown.  In addition, U.S. financial meeting by well more than 25 basis there's no sense of the Committee getting behind liftoff for this meeting to let both the exists today as justifying a lengthy delay before liftoff.

Thank you, We had a chart timing of liftoff by FOMC 50 percent by the time we lift off.
