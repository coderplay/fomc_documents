So both motions are on the table, and the floor is open CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  We have the Desk report, and we'll have to vote to ratify domestic open market operations, and we also have the next stage of testing for questions.  President Fisher.

September 17-18, 2013

I find this proposal unobjectionable, but I footnote of the memo, footnote 7.  In referring to said, 'They also noted some particular concern about potential indexed swap (OIS) market, which is based on the daily federal funds exist for outstanding Here's my question:  Do you think the full implementation of market to eventually MR.

you made a very important point.  Again, in my simple mind, the is under the FOMC, through fed funds.  The IOER is under the Board. we have a dual governance structure and the governance of the ON RRP facility each rate stands, in terms of tightening or loosening.  Do I understand MR. FISHER.  But governance of this facility So in a way would depend on where that correctly?

So one thing to think about is that the full implementation would affect market might change from one where basically the FHLBs are selling you would see the fed funds market just be idiosyncratic trades and not be money market conditions.

We don't really know how big the effects of the full implementation of the facility would be, but it's quite possible, as Chris pointed out, that representative of overall governance of the MR. FISHER.  I think the important thing to me is that it's under the FOMC.  So I just wanted to underscore that.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

September 17-18, 2013

Even though, technically, the IOER is under the Board's you know, we've been working on a gentlemen's and ladies' agreement to take rate under the governance of the FOMC, and I think that's a small advantage of this CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. discretion, as these decisions collectively.  I think this moves things in the right direction because it puts the key proposal.  President Lacker.

an operating instrument for monetary policy operations, and I've At the July meeting we had some discussion of this, and I go further down this path.  The Manager has done a good counterparties about their thoughts about the likely effects of this, but the research I I think we're lacking here is a sense of where going down this path and why.  Let me give you an example. MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I share the sense of intrigue with an overnight RRP as sort of actually proposed that idea before. suggested some research would be warranted before we was kind enough to be in communication with me about that research.  The staff job of asking had in mind was really something else.  What we're to provide a hard floor under the RP rate. larger, and fairly volatile.  There wasn't a hard reason why it's a problem now or likely to be more of a problem going The staff has suggested that we're aiming Well, before 2008 we targeted the fed funds rate, and we operated with a substantial spread to the RP rate-10, 15, 20 basis points, at times floor under the overnight RP rate, and we didn't seem to think it was a problem then.  The staff hasn't provided any forward.

raise a couple of other concerns about this path that I think deserve some really whose business model bank regulations, and if we're to get them to voluntarily hold overnight I'll careful consideration.  One is this expands us into doing a fair amount of business with money market mutual funds.  So the traditional thinking is that this is an industry is based on the bypass of

September 17-18, 2013

in the sense that they for the structure of money markets, for us to market mutual funds.  At a bare minimum, we need some go down that road.  It's not obvious that there's some inefficiency that this in the broader sense.  I'd also point out that, because of primary dealers, the dealers are thought to enjoy sort of an imprimatur of the New who have been 'blessed' by being anointed as counterparties to the Desk. RRP investments with us, kind of by definition, that makes them better off can offer a higher and safer rate of return than they otherwise would if we weren't in that market. It's not obvious to me that this is a good thing enhance the competitiveness of money thought before we would cure regarding the margin between bank and nonbank intermediation, or-I guess you could think of it as shadow and nonshadow banking.  I thought we didn't think that was an industry that was very well structured their status as York Fed, that they're accepted into a club.  Presumably, the same thing will hold for money market mutual funds

RP market.  This market is, in my view, going to be without some more-fundamental a lock on clearing and in the triparty RP market.  The participants who clear and settle with them are highly either bank the power to refuse are triparty RP market-to the tune of $5, $10, $15 billion a day-and it's the way always done our open market operations, this is a fundamental-enough flaw that it before we go extending and broadening our involvement in that market. Another broad concern has to do with the triparty deeply flawed.  I think it's a consensus in the System.  The New York Fed has been doing yeoman's work going down the path toward triparty RP market reform.  That work is not complete.  It's not clear how successful it's changes.  You know, I point out the flaw there.  Two banks have settlement dependent on intraday overdrafts from those banks, which gives an unwind and force us into an untenable situation like we saw in March 2008.  Although we involved in the we've deserves some thought

September 17-18, 2013

an excellent point last time, which is that we're not going to know are until we do this at scale.  And the corollary is, I I don't see a real what money market we intervene in, and how and under what has evolved over the years.  We took a run at this before the crisis.  We For me, we need that again if we're going to go down the road why, and we have a little more confidence about what effect it's going a time of austerity, it's not clear to me a good use of our resources before we've operational regime and figure out whether this is what we want, or if there is some way we can improve Governor Stein made what the implications of doing this at scale don't think we want to do this at scale until we're ready to do it at scale.  So huge value in pursuing more of this.  Now, this has to do with monetary policy operations, the configuration of precisely conditions.  Our system did a fairly substantial amount of study.  Some people around this table were involved in looking at different operational regimes. of some completely different operating scheme.  I'd rather see us do that analysis so we know where we're headed and to have.  Until then, these operations may be harmful.  In that further operational exercises of this type are really done the kind of analysis we've done several times in our past to study the we're under on it.

I think we should table it, and I think experts we have here to further explore where our operational regime. So, Mr. Chairman, I do not support this resolution. you should commission some study from the we're headed in terms of are two ways to think about this.  One way is ultimate operating regime, which is what we studied before the crisis.  But would be to think about it as another pair of suspenders to help ensure a smooth exit CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think there to think about the another way from the large balance sheet that we currently have.

just say a couple of things? MR. POTTER.  Can I say

September 17-18, 2013

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.

Reserves are quite large, as you might have noticed.  We don't really money markets with reserves of that size.  The fact that these are all in the pre-2007 is going to tell us that much.  The correlation between the repo and fed funds rates has gap, if there was a strong correlation between repo and MR. POTTER. have experience in banking system is a property of the way we've been operating.  There's some interest in allowing the rest of the system to have some access to those reserves.  So I don't think that really dropped.  So it's true there could be a other money market rates.

with what you said about being important for that industry, but they are a very large presence in money markets can't act as though they're not there.  With respect to putting a stamp on any auctions or the kind of trust you'd expect to see with the primary is coming to us, not the other way around. On dealing with the money market funds, I think we'd all agree reform right now, and we of these 139 counterparties, I doubt if anyone knows the names of them.  The 21 primary dealers are out there on our website.  But these 139 counterparties have a very different relationship.  It doesn't involve the Treasury dealers because the money have to use a triparty system right now.  It's not something over the long quite convenient and one of the reasons it's used a lot is it's a very repo market. And we really run we'd necessarily have to use.  We could build out our own way of handling the transactions, but the triparty system is efficient way of engaging the

So in the exercises you have done in MR. LACKER.  Can I follow up, Mr. Chairman? this intermeeting period, you have learned about the operational logistics and mechanics of us operating our system and interacting with counterparties?

MR. POTTER.  At low volumes, yes.

September 17-18, 2013

So you will learn about another digit on the numbers I mean, the broader point here is that, operationally, I think you would have a you know how to push the right buttons to get the trade made.  As not sure that even if this gets up to $80 or $100 billion you're going to MR. LACKER.  At low going forward? fair amount of confidence that far as market effect, I'm learn much.

research based on that.  We view this as a If we do start to learn, it tells us something about how money going to have to think more.  Introducing at full scale without trying to learn seems a risky you point out.  This is a potentially quite large facility, and we don't want to do MR. POTTER.  So our intention is to do more scale where we might learn more. markets are functioning in the United States.  If we don't learn, we are about how to learn some thing to do, as any harm in the actual full introduction of it.

I have President Evans next. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.

concern about this particular issue.  I would be happy to MR. EVANS.  I have a different pass to Governor Stein, who seems a little more-

MR. STEIN.  No, I'm fine.

a little more nervous about your last you pointed out that this is going to help us out with the exit from our large going to need some help, so I favor that.  But I wonder if this is the There were a lot of comments about how, of course, inferences about what this testing means for our next policy course, and and whatnot.  I'm not sure I can have in that.  Everyone in the marketplace knows about these tests, guess my questions are:  How much time do we really think we MR. EVANS.  Okay.  Well, Mr. Chairman, I was comment where balance sheet.  And we are right time to engage in this type of testing. no one should make any I have some other questions about that related to forward guidance how much confidence right?  This is not a secret.  So I

September 17-18, 2013

Is it measured in four months or six months?  Is it critical that we do were to delay this for perhaps a year, would that leave enough time?  And perhaps a tool for exit. need to prove this system? it now?  If we that, by itself, would also send a signal, since it is ultimately

The easiest way to have tested this would have been in 2007, before we going to have the fact that people might confuse this got from the July minutes suggests, because of the out there, people think there is a reason that this, separate from just getting ready to exit.  I would say that the you are expressing is definitely one that the staff has faced.  That's why you see the I don't see necessarily that there is another window out there that you to decide how much you want to learn now rather MR. POTTER. had the large balance sheet.  We are always with actual exit.  The coverage that we collateral shortage stories and other things that are we might be introducing concern that various options here.  But allows us to learn.  And it's a tradeoff for than learn closer to the exit period.

a two-hander, Vice Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You have

My own view of your observation, President Evans, is to taper at this meeting, introducing this facility would be pretty way.  But if we decide not to taper at this that we're not tapering meeting, there is this opportunity to put this in place and separate the potential that this is VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. that if we were to decide dangerous because it might be taken the wrong meeting, that actually creates a window for introducing this facility, so that it won't be misconstrued as part of the exit story.  So, to me, if we end up in the place at this part of the exit story.  It allows us to firm up the story that this is about monetary policy control, damping volatility in money market rates, reducing net interest expense potential- going to do? MR. FISHER.  So, Mr. Vice Chairman, should we defer this decision until after the discussion of what we're

September 17-18, 2013

going to do.  So whyyou think that argument is germane. It had more weight with that argument. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  That's the logicalMR. FISHER.  We haven't decided what we're VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Well, assuming MR. FISHER.  Well, you're making the point. MR. EVANS.

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  We could make it conditional on the monetary policy decision, I suppose.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Stein.

Lacker said, that I going to really know how this thing works at scale until we do scale.  To me, that is an argument for trying to get to scale as soon as we reasonably can.  If and others raised, if we could somehow clearly doing this because it is sort of a smart way to run your balance sheet for given size of the balance sheet, I would be saying, 'Simon, tell me, when we have cleared I think until we have going to know the answer, and it is rather than later. MR. STEIN.  I just wanted to clarify, with regard to what President agree, absolutely, that we are not it at it wasn't for the issues that President Evans separate that we are just any the first operational hurdle, how do we move to the next and to the next?' really done a trillion dollars' worth of this stuff, we are not really important for us to know the answer sooner seems quite large for overnight, but maybe we can change it.

MR. POTTER.  Trillions [Laughter]

our balance sheet. MR. STEIN.  It has to be a meaningful fraction of

That is possible.  Or the fact that the facility is there each day, and you you can always go to the Fed, will affect market rates.  So one of is that it should put a floor on market rates, just by MR. POTTER. know early in the morning that the conceptual things that we know is true

September 17-18, 2013

with the interest on excess reserves is, that that starts to work, is the itself, without any use.  What we know from practice doesn't work perfectly.  So how much do we have to absorb before question.  It could be a trillion dollars.  And that would tell us a lot about how money markets function in the United States.

would have to be willing to go into that neighborhood to fully MR. STEIN.  I think we answer the sorts of questions that we would want to answer.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.

where this leaves us. going to learn a whole lot until we do it with scale, and, I hadn't thought about what Dudley mentioned, but it is signaling something that we have yet to decide upon, MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'm just wondering We're not Vice Chairman or at least would impact some signaling.  So I would suggest we defer this discussion until after we decide the course of policy.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I don't want to defer the discussion because we have very tight time constraints tomorrow morning.  So we should just continue the discussion now, and we can discuss how to proceed at that point.  President Kocherlakota.

I will start with an initial statement, which is that I am related you heard, which is, what do you think that we are going to learn MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes. quite interested in further study of this facility.  I did have a question for Simon or Chris to some of the conversations about operations of this scale?

completely different for overnight than what we have been years to support the term facility.  And there is some real value that in place and then really exercise it with MR. BURKE.  Without getting into too much detail about the settlement methodology, the entire back office processing is working on for the last several for us and for the clearing banks to be able to put

September 17-18, 2013

triparty reform, there and other things that we want to take advantage of.  And we can't do has repo. some volume regularly, so that we can work through the kinks.  Also, with have been a lot of new innovations-things that probably should have been there from the beginning, like matching that until we have the baseline experience with the relatively new processes that reform created in triparty are two other things.  I think it is about $300 billion that our MR. POTTER.  There counterparties have overnight right now.

About $380 billion in triparty. MR. BURKE.

Yes, about $380 billion.  This is a pretty significant share of overnight repo, so we'll learn a little bit about how they respond to the existence of the facility. MR. POTTER. Treasury are hoping to learn is at the end of quarter, end of year, and other where there are big fluctuations in the repo rate, what does the usage look like?  How does rates on the days when the usage goes up a lot?  So we think we can Chris stated, if you feel you could learn a lot, gradual when you introduce a facility like this. The other thing that we days our facility affect market learn; it's possible that we might not learn.  So, as you should be quite

You can correct me if I'm wrong on this, but I guess the potentially tighter rate on excess reserves.  Is that a fair MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. vision I have in my head is that ultimately this will be a tool that will give us control over market rates than using the interest characterization?

MR. POTTER.  For overnight rates, yes.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.

actually will reveal changes from 1 basis point to VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  From my perspective, the testing something on two dimensions.  One, how sensitive is demand for

September 17-18, 2013

sensitive is demand about Europe?  All of those things are going to also affect the demand sensitive that is.  And the testing, I think, will 2 basis points?  And we just don't know the answer to that.  And, two, how to the external factors that affect money market conditions, like quarter-end, year-end, financial market stresses, worries curve for safe assets, and we just don't know how reveal it.

also think this facility, earlier rather than later, gives us potentially down the road an goes well and was exhausted.  Well, we could then potentially reduce the interest rate on excess I don't think, in the environment because we don't really know what that would do to the whole constellation you put a solid floor in place, then you have a little bit more flexibility in terms of you do with the ceiling.  So I think it also has that potential benefit. I additional degree of freedom in monetary policy.  You can imagine if the testing we learn something, we could get more comfortable using this.  Let's say the economic news were to disappoint, but we didn't feel like we wanted to increase asset purchases or we felt that that channel reserves from 25 basis points to some lower rate.  That's not really feasible, current of rates.  If what

Lacker. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President

I mean, if we are interested in controlling rates, where does that We'd intervene in anything if we wanted to control it more closely.  It is not you want to control RP rates more closely.  That's the thing. MR. LACKER.  I was just going to say about tighter control of rates, that it's not obvious that argument stops at RPs. argument stop? clear why

I would point out is that this experiment will give us some data in an current environment, which could be very different after we raise rates.  It could if we are targeting the fed funds And the other thing envelope of the be very different if we are setting a rate closer to the IOER or

September 17-18, 2013

It's not clear how that is going to affect this.  So it's part of the package, and I'm not sure rate. how well we are going to be able to extrapolate from what we learn here.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.

President you would have the authority to of this until after the meeting.  Is that a correct reading of this MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes.  To address the concern that was raised by Evans, it seems like the terms of this resolution are such that defer the announcement resolution?

any announcement or any testing until after the minutes or indefinitely if for some reason CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, it will be in the minutes if we approve it.  We could defer you wanted to do that.

guess I feel comfortable with this resolution on those terms concerns raised by President Evans. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I regarding the

I ask?

MR. FISHER.  May

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  A two-hander?

Just on the odd chance that we do reduce our purchases, there's a Chairman Dudley talked about.  Does this conflict at all in your mind, MR. FISHER.  I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.  I just want to ask for clarification on that.  So, just make the assumption that we decide to cut back on our purchases.  We would defer the announcement of this thing? signaling aspect that Vice Simon?

MR. POTTER.  I think that the way we framed it is it depends on how markets react, and adding volatility to the markets is not something that we would want to do.

MR. FISHER.  Okay.  So we would be judicious.

Yes, as always. MR. POTTER.

September 17-18, 2013

Lacker. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any other questions?  President going to raise RP if we weren't in the market.  Would that be a fair MR. LACKER.  Just one more comment.  If we do this, presumably it's rates above where they would be characterization?

It's not the full implementation, but the proposed testing, with MR. POTTER. restrictions.

LACKER. So, $100 billion, $200 billion, that scale.  Presumably, in some states of MR. the world, the RP rate will be higher than it otherwise would be?

the facility MR. POTTER.  Under the counterfactual that we have here, on certain days could affect those rates.  On other days, with close to zero usage, you wouldn't expect it to.

would have been, right? MR. LACKER.  Right.  So then, if we stop doing this, rates would go back down to where they otherwise goes up for safe assets at quarter-end, and the next day it goes down. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Not quite.  I mean, quarter-end is a very special event. The demand

LACKER. The point I want to make is that if we do this and then we want to use we will have already tightened policy first. MR. this as a tool to ease policy, we would start in a very gradual way, you about how sensitive the good news, because for a smaller size MR. POTTER.  Yes.  So that's one of the reasons and if we learn, even with the small amounts and the 1 basis point, that we can have some effect, then that's very important information for us to learn and to give repo rate would be to this facility.  In some sense it's very of operation, we'll be able to affect rates.

saying this is a degree of freedom for monetary policy.  You away in order to use this. MR. LACKER.  I'm just have to first take the degree of freedom

September 17-18, 2013

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans.

that we were you wide scope to adjust this however you I do have another question for the Desk, if that's okay. MR. EVANS.  Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to raise this issue to make sure informed of this in our discussion.  I'm perfectly prepared to support this resolution, especially after President Kocherlakota mentioned that it gives see fit.

of our CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sure.  We're still open for questions to either colleagues.

fascinating discussion about the in the dealers' survey, and about our purchases and how that likely interacts dealers' assessments of the probability that the unemployment rate will be above Looking at the path of the funds rate, I an assessment that the economy was doing I understood what you said, above are tightly linked to people who had a change in on asset purchases; is that right? MR. EVANS.  Simon, on exhibit 1, you went through a implied funds rate with 6½ percent when the first funds rate increase takes place. might have thought that a good chunk of that was better and they were thinking about it that way.  Just to make sure you made a comment that the people who thought that the unemployment rate might be 6½ percent when we do the first funds rate hike views question 4, the asset purchases, and higher numbers for the unemployment rate at liftoff. forward guidance and MR. POTTER.  There was a 70 percent correlation between the answer to change in views on For me, that reflected how independent some of the tools are.  In May and June, we clearly saw that some market participants do not think the tools are independent-the the balance sheet actions.

concern.  That was very interesting.  Thank you. MR. EVANS.  Right, that was my CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.

September 17-18, 2013

an interjection?  The people I've talked if financial stability are motivating us to reduce our asset purchases, those same financial stability concerns you look at what has actually seen a backup going to lead to an earlier liftoff. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Can I just make to have said that one reason why the tools might not be independent is that concerns could influence our willingness to be lower for longer.  And, in fact, if actually happened over the last few months, we have seen both.  So we've in interest rates in the 2014 period, which might be informed by a market judgment that somehow we're concerned about financial stability and that's So I think there is a potential reason why those two questions get linked.

is that the expectations are still where other factors like term premiums and so on obscure that.  Any other CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Another possibility we want them to be, but questions?  President Bullard.

you, Mr. Chairman.  I'm looking at exhibit 3, panel 13.  Why is MR. BULLARD.  Thank this picture jagged?

guess.  I you are saying, that there are press conferences that we could have you would tend to see is that if we went back and drew it with just with press conference meetings.  The way we've done it two MR. POTTER.  Why is it jagged?  Because of the way that we drew it, I understand exactly what singled out here, and what dates, the changes would be associated here, you can't see that as much.  A lot of the market participants do think that it would take to three months of data to make the next change.  So some people do think that the FOMC would start at a non-press-conference meeting.

you did start at a meeting for which there at meetings for which there MR. BULLARD.  But this suggests that, if wasn't a press conference, that all subsequent moves would be made weren't press conferences.

September 17-18, 2013

No.  Remember, this is the median at each point.  It's not a path of the is a different concept, and I guess we could give everyone's path and try MR. POTTER. median person.  So that to show that.

I'd like to understand about this is, suppose we we delay or would they expect a steeper slope? MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  The other thing delay.  Would the slope of this line be the same if asking people that question on the dealer survey.  There was a little bit of evidence ask a asset purchases at this meeting. MR. POTTER.  I think we would all like the answer to that question.  I didn't feel comfortable that dealers who expected the reductions to start later had bigger changes, but we did not about what would happen to their expectations for the size of the increments if there was decision not to reduce

to exhibit 1, panel 2.  A lot of factors influence term premiums, a speech at the end of June, which emphasized how little we still know I think one possible factor is, in fact, monetary I have in mind is that the aggressiveness with which monetary policy and going to be very aggressive about going to be as aggressive, that will, in fact, have the opposite effect of and economic conditions MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I had a quick comment about term premiums, which I think relates and Governor Stein gave about what influences the term premium.  But policy itself.  What responds to weak economic conditions will build into a covariance between interest rates economic conditions.  For example, if people think we are keeping rates low or buying lots of assets in response to weak economic conditions, then the prices of those bonds will be high, and that will drive down the term premium.  If, in fact, they think that we're not driving up the term premium.  So the covariation of our responses

September 17-18, 2013

the term premium.  I think this matters for considerations of policy because sort of to build this automatic stabilizer effect into monetary term premiums, but one of the influences is beliefs about our reaction function. actually influences the game plan last September was policy.  That shows up.  One way it shows up is in driving down term premiums.  As several have emphasized, there's a lot of things influencing us and people's year-end 2013 guess I would have been interested in knowing, if things went something like year-end 2014 SOMA portfolio look like? Then I had a question about exhibit 3, panel 14.  I guess this is unemployment.  I mid-2014 economic conditions, what would the

we do is we look at the most recent SEP.  We take the central of the central tendency to make this question for the dealer survey.  We not giving information to the dealers that they don't already have. MR. POTTER.  So what tendency and either side feel that that's

I see.  I see the problem. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.

I would say is that the tails have shrunk.  So the percent of over $4.5 trillion is definitely starting to shrink.  And these We could ask a scenario with a much higher unemployment rate, but I think craft it in a slightly different way. MR. POTTER.  And what dealers putting the SOMA portfolio are not big differences, above and below $4 trillion.  You don't see that much difference across these scenarios. we'd probably

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thanks.

I think given the ongoing nature of this, it would be interesting, at least Lacker who would Is there anyone who opposes at this time?  All right.  Seeing none CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  First, let's approve domestic market operations just so I don't forget.  If there are no objections-thank you.  On the proposal to approve testing, this is an FOMC decision, but for the record, to know if there are any participants other than President oppose testing at this time.

I take the FOMC as approving this resolution?  Okay.  Thank you.  Let's turn now to Situation,' and I'll call on David Wilcox to introduce. then, may the 'Economic and Financial fiscal policy I wish I could dispense with, more literally than figuratively.  The quick you know, is that it's a scary mess.  For purposes of putting assumed that federal government operations for the year will be funded without a shutdown and at a level consistent with assumed that the debt ceiling will be lifted appears to be nothing MR. WILCOX. 3   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'll be referring to a packet titled 'Material for Forecast Summary.'  I would like to begin by dispensing with the policy assumptions for our Tealbook projection.  Actually, it's the assumptions summary here, as together our baseline forecast, we coming fiscal the budget caps and sequestration, and we without incident or further near-term budget restraint.  But I have to admit that the decibel level of the posturing is a little disconcerting, and there but downside risk here.

likewise nearly unrevised from you will begin to reduce the pace of year and end the purchase phase of the program around the middle of year, bringing cumulative purchases under the current program to about I will discuss shortly, we rate tracking a little lower over the forecast period than rule that we are using to govern our assumption for the occurs in the second quarter of 2015, one quarter earlier than On the monetary policy side, our assumptions are the July projection.  We continue to assume that purchases this next $1.2 trillion, unrevised from our assumption in July.  As have the unemployment before, so under the policy federal funds rate, liftoff in the previous Tealbook.

economic outcomes, as you can see in the top-left panel of your year than appeared to be the case at the time of the July was concentrated in inventory from the Tealbook, we have marked down our forecast for real GDP year a little, partly on the basis of the disappointing in light of the slightly tighter Turning to the first exhibit, real GDP now is estimated to have increased considerably more during the second quarter of this Tealbook.  However, because the upward surprise investment and government purchases, we have not projected it to persist.  Indeed, as you know growth in the second half of this reading on consumer spending in July, and partly financial conditions.

had anticipated, but not enough to would also note that the August The data that we received after the September Tealbook was closed, including the August retail sales and industrial production reports and the August Monthly Treasury Statement were a little stronger than we have any material effect on our near-term outlook.  I report on housing starts and permits will be published tomorrow morning.

real GDP growth is a shade weaker than slightly less-accommodative financial conditions that we period, including a higher path of long-term interest rates Beyond the near term, our projection for before, on account of the project over the forecast

value of the dollar.  In 2016, which we-like you-included real GDP beginning to growth. and a stronger exchange in our medium-term projection for the first time, we have decelerate toward its potential rate of described in the Tealbook, we a little narrower than we thought in July, currently we have it 2015 see it as essentially unrevised As is reflected in the upper-right panel, and as we fiddled some with the supply-side parameters of our framework in 2012 and the first half of 2013, in order to allow a little more room for the unemployment rate to decline despite only moderate GDP growth.  But the bigger picture is that, while we now see the GDP gap as closing less quickly than before, and therefore by from the July projection.

you can infer from the middle-left panel, the recent core expected in the July Tealbook.  Going changes in the measurement of so-called nonmarket prices lowered core PCE inflation by about this amount over history.  As before, core inflation edging up toward your 2 percent objective at a an anticipated decline in am happy to report as well that this morning's CPI report was so I authorized our inflation analyst to spike the CPI release in I Turning to inflation, as consumer price data have come in about as we forward, we have shaved a tenth out of our core inflation projection, as methodological the average rate of we continue to see glacial pace.  And we expect headline PCE inflation-not shown-to run a little below core inflation over the medium term, held down by energy prices.

Unfortunately, because she is a native of Bulgaria, that image did not immediately resonate, so in my inimitable fashion, proceeded to demonstrate.  [Laughter]

first exhibit summarizes developments in the labor market. received since the July Tealbook were for the unemployment rate over the past year or so, we marked down our middle-right panel-over the our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment-implying unemployment rate reflected a The remainder of the In a nutshell, the two labor market reports we decidedly mixed.  On the household side, the unemployment rate came in at 7.3 percent in August, 0.2 percentage point below our July Tealbook projection.  In response, and partly informed by our nearly unbroken string of one-sided forecast errors projected path for the jobless rate-shown in the remainder of the medium term.  And again in light of our forecast error history, we also shaved a tenth from that only about half of the August surprise in the tighter margin of labor market slack.

was that the participation rate a tenth as well.  As always, a work in progress The other material surprise in the household survey came in 0.2 percentage point lower than we had expected.  We wrote off half of this surprise as likely reflecting seasonal-adjustment difficulties around the back-to-school period, but we took the other half as prompting us to be a little more pessimistic about the structural trend in this series, and so took it down by of course, we regard these assumptions about the supply side as and will modify them further as needed.

I noted earlier, the unemployment rate is now end of 2016, the unemployment rate is expected With these various revisions, as projected to cross the Committee's 6½ percent threshold one quarter earlier than in the previous Tealbook.  And by the to be 5.3 percent, essentially back to our estimate of the natural rate.

July payroll job growth than we growth in output. On the establishment side, and as is reflected in the lower-left panel, payroll job growth came in weaker than we expected in the two most recent jobs reports, with the level of payroll employment in August 130,000 below our projection in the Tealbook.  In response, we trimmed our forecast for fourth-quarter to 165,000 per month, about 15,000 less than in the July Tealbook.  Over the balance of the medium term, payroll employment is expected to rise a bit less rapidly had projected in July, reflecting the slower of the issue of slack, the lower-right panel pauses briefly you two other variables that, historically, have tended to move quite closely gap in labor utilization.  In particular, the panel plots our gap against households' assessment of job by the Conference Board, and small businesses' assessment have in filling job openings, as measured by the NFIB.  While all three years but remains appreciably Because of the centrality to show with our estimate of the estimate of the unemployment rate availability, as measured of the difficulty they the exact degree of improvement implied by the various measures differs, suggest that labor utilization has improved in recent short of full employment at present.

your deliberations today and tomorrow, I thought it a step back and consider how the outlook has changed since year, when the Committee initiated the current round of LSAPs and you were looking for a substantial improvement in the of key measures of economic activity, inflation, and the Tealbook of one year ago.  I strongly suspect for, but I have going to take a risk and plow ahead.  I here to Jeremy Rudd for assembling this table and some As background for the rest of would be helpful to take September of last set out the guidepost that outlook for the labor market.  Accordingly, the second exhibit compares our current projections for a number financial conditions to the ones from that this exhibit will generate more questions than I have answers found it quite thought-provoking, and so I'm want to extend special thanks additional background information.

you can see from the first block of numbers, our forecast for real GDP growth remarkably little over the last year, on net, and although I haven't shown either, though we did take down the level of potential GDP throughout the about ½ percentage point. As has changed it here, our estimate of potential GDP growth over the forecast period isn't much different period by a large downward revision to our unemployment rate end of 2014, our forecast for the unemployment rate is 1 percentage year ago.  In large part, the way we've kept the for the natural rate; at the end of 2014, our assumption for the natural But, as the second block indicates, despite relatively slight adjustments to our GDP outlook, we have made forecast:  By the point lower than we expected a analytics of this aspect of the forecast hanging together is by marking down our nearterm trajectory

I should hasten to add that and our estimate of the natural you can see from the third block of about year ago. rate is ¾ percentage point lower than we had it a the adjustment we've made to the natural rate mostly just pulls forward the improvement that we had expected to see eventually rate in the long run is basically unrevised.  As numbers, we've also been surprised to the downside by the participation rate, though not by as much as we were surprised by the unemployment rate.  On net, the employment-to-population ratio-not shown-is now projected to be 0.2 percentage point higher at the end of 2014 than we were forecasting one year, but change in the measurement of I mentioned earlier. Turning to inflation-blocks 4 and 5-our forecast is down for this thereafter is little revised, taking account of the nonmarket prices that

are the ones in the one year ago, and, as shown in block 7, the same is true year ago, and the path of picture that looks more restrictive a year ago is the exchange value of the dollar-block 9-which is a To my mind, the most interesting numbers in the tables remainder, which provide some perspective on financial developments over the period.  Specifically, as shown in block 6, our forecast for the 10-year Treasury yield is essentially unrevised from for the 30-year mortgage rate.  At the same time, our forecast for the trajectory of stock prices-block 8-is up more than 10 percent from one house prices-not shown-is roughly 15 percent higher, on average, relative to last year.  The only major dimension of the financial than we expected few percentage points stronger than we expected as of last September.

expect that there might be at I will not venture far. an economy that arguably has made a little a year ago, longer-term are no higher than we projected.  Moreover, a range of other asset easier than we had anticipated.  And, indeed, in our forecast of year ago, we had not incorporated anything like the full scope of the current your additional forward guidance built in.  The one piece of explained of Abenomics in Japan, nor had we market economies. So those are the facts.

However, the underlying momentum of the Mexican economy seems weaker than we thought previously, and although we see bouncing back, we've revised down growth in a number of other EMEs to reflect Simon described in his presentation.  To be sure, the some stimulus to emerging is being reinforced as some central banks tighten depreciations.  All told, we judge a net drag on growth.

More generally, leverage within the financial system relative to pre-crisis levels appears moderate, and the SCOOS indicates that some of those actors that had shown increased willingness to deploy leverage earlier this stepped back funding, as can be seen in the middle-right panel, which shows across the entire financial sector has fallen substantially.  At banks, sharp drop in money market fund are also important factors.  Decreased reliance on short-term reduced.

I would like to offer specifically on the projections for 2016.  Most participants project that by late 2016 the economy will be very close to maximum employment.  The calculated

If they plug the central tendencies value for the end of 2016 of 3¾ percent, compared or she arrived rationales, so I think among ourselves about why our funds rate projections One possible rationale is that these funds rate settings reflect a commitment policy in But looking at the individual projections, it appears that, with very few didn't actually incorporate sustained overshooting in my own SEP projection.

Such a policy post-2016 would lead to sustained overshooting of inflation and undershooting of the unemployment rate. exceptions, they are more in line with monotonic convergence of the unemployment rate back to its longer-run normal value and inflation to 2 percent as in the Tealbook baseline.

But what economic news has been on the good side economies seem to be on a recovery path. conditions in those economies, although, as Europe have continued to improve a bit on net.

a little bit more about that particular aspect that the spreads were a little bit high at the initial offering, and a lot of price action on the initial day.

In March, we had a discussion about the importance of macroprudential actions and supervisory instabilities, especially in an environment with low interest rates. only take note, but apparently comments the other day monetary policy is set incorrectly, it can generate regulatory or supervisory actions can't really mitigate them.  I will have to go dig that up because I thought that was sobering, to the actions that we have taken since I Do we feel comfortable that the additional supervisory March have been addressing the financial instability concerns that we pointed to last March?

I think in general we are comfortable that right direction, that when pockets are identified, things are done.  I gave would like to bring that up for two reasons.  One, things are good because we do think there is an aggressive credit.  I would also note there that the guidance was in the works for a very long that in February and say, 'Oh, let's do something by March.'

We've just had going back to, say, May, but the analysis from the Board and happened since April-May in terms of the MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a couple of questions for Mike Kiley.  Previous QS assessments have noted the risk of spikes in interest rates.  Of course, in those earlier important and spiking rates a significant spike in interest rates others is it's mostly in term premiums, not expected interest rates or other factors.  My first question really is, what did we learn from what's

September 17-18, 2013

regarding financial stability but more effect of the spike in interest rates, given the source of the shock?  And, related to that, how has that affected smaller banks and regional banks, not just broadly?

I can, let me just ask a quick second question, which is around your indicators of am impressed with your courage to draw trend lines around clearly have interesting, colorful shapes.  But what I a point of reference to growth rates or levels?  I open up that And if vulnerabilities.  I nonstationary series.  [Laughter]  And I notice they really am asking is a serious question.  What do you want us to look at, or how do you and your colleagues think about this?  Is the point of having the trend lines to have some previous peak or trough?

your second question first.  I'll introduce a comic an econometrician.  The HP filter handles  (2) series, so there's no concern about MR. KILEY.

I think the back-testing of what kind of signal we get from a measure like this MR. KILEY.  One of the reasons middle right, was to raise exactly looking at the credit-to-GDP ratio.  We don't know the trends for these series, and we don't know the sustainable levels.  We could be way off.  What should we look at? the levels relative to trends.  We should back-test how good those sorts of in credit-to-GDP space. conclusions from that kind of

They suggest that we get some information from a signal like this, but also credit growth and at a broader set of developments.  I suppose I we look at:  What's going on with regard to leverage in the nonfinancial How leveraged are the financial institutions? are a little bit mixed. that we should be looking at would say the same thing for the other series.  These are not a sufficient set of statistics, but they highlight key things that sector and hence, the credit risks of the borrowers that, if economic conditions deteriorate, could spill over into losses for financial institutions?

a simple measure for banks.  We don't necessarily have a wide range of other institutions, but we have other measures and hold It's It has been used in some recent research by academics.  It's fairly comprehensive funds, money market funds, insurers, pensions, also a disadvantage of this in that the QS some points in the past, but it does have a lot I'm good job of looking at all those things.  That's a pretty I think that's really important because these are new The panel at the middle-left gives these measures for conversations with market contacts in order to get a sense there.  Short-term funding, shown on the middle-right, is a measure that we haven't presented before in a briefing like this. interesting. because it includes banks, broker-dealers, mutual and you get a sense of what's going on in the whole sector.  There's measure because it's a whole bunch of actors who behave a little bit differently.  So we wouldn't look only at something like this, but we've been trying to show a little bit of mercy report might be slightly shorter than it has been at of stuff in there.  I look at every single one of them.  I might not remember every one, but sure that, across the staff, we do a pretty general look-at-everything answer, but areas.

Mike, if we saw a doubling or even more than a doubling of this net months, that would put it back on trend, but would MR. WILLIAMS. short-term wholesale debt over the next six

you also say, 'Hey, doubling in six months Should I be looking at the change or should I be looking-

I wouldn't be able to pinpoint exactly would have to think a lot harder, but I would be, yes. MR. KILEY.  I would be very worried about that. why, and I

increased. memo was sent to the Committee in March saying interest rates can go up.  In fact, they did. It wasn't a huge shock.  REITs were adversely affected. I would I think people think that REITs actually what was expected. Let's move back now to the question on what's happened since interest rates A We highlighted that that would lead to losses at banks of a certain size on their available-for-sale portfolios if that kind of thing happened.  Given the size of the increase in interest rates, it was in the ballpark of what we expected. There was amplification in the effect on the market through them having to shed assets. say that that was as expected directionally, but weathered this storm a little bit better than move, if there you eat into capital, you might get closer to a trigger Now, that leads to the question of whether or not the next 100 basis point were one, would be the same as the last.  As point, and the next 100 basis points could be tougher for some levered investors.  However, this may have been a wake-up call and people may step back from positions, and so the next 100 basis points could be less worrisome for those sorts of actors.

guess another sector that we highlighted was insurers.  To date, we don't get high rates, which may reflect an ability over time to yields and meet some of the liabilities that they have, and it also may reflect the gone up.  They haven't I frequency financial reporting on insurers.  It's a slow-moving sector.  Certainly their stock prices have reacted positively to the increase in interest invest at higher lack of disintermediation from their products because long rates have

Just to highlight, from a financial stability perspective, 100 is a big deal for monetary policy.  We were certainly concerned.  We didn't write a 100 basis point spike in interest rates, and I guess that's all I would have I'd say directionally things are pretty areas, actually quantitatively basis points down huge losses for to say.

based on the 100 basis points, we didn't get any MR. WILLIAMS.  The punchline is that, big negative news.

any big negative news, and I think there's some positive of negative news, and I'll let Simon jump in, is we certainly had some constraint problems in markets.  Nonetheless, maybe perhaps painful for some actors, but it didn't rise to a stability concern. MR. KILEY.  We didn't get news.  Maybe one piece concerns that there would be some liquidity we expected dealers to make markets a little bit better than what we saw.  That made the situation was the global carry trade and how that unwound. at other countries right MR. POTTER.  I think the one thing That probably wasn't featured in the report, which is why we're looking now, but that would be the most surprising.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I thought this chart 'The Activity, Inflation, and Financial Projections' that David presented and useful.  I had questions about the evolution of the employment-toyou noted, the employment-to-population ratio forecast now for the end of was in the September 2012 meeting.  There was MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Evolution of Various Key was very interesting population ratio.  As 2014 is about 0.2 percentage point higher than it

September 17-18, 2013

and September of last year by if that change between August and might actually be influencing the bump up in the forecast. a big jump in the employment-to-population ratio between August about 0.3, in fact, from 58.4 to 58.7 percent.  I wondered September electronic devices so, I was actually forced to try to multiply by hand [laughter], which I was getting something on the order of 59.6 percent.  That years relative to what we've seen since the recovery guess the first question is:  What is the implied employment-to-population ratio in And, second, why is the behavior of labor force participation and the employment-togoing to be so different over the next couple of years as opposed to the couple of years? Another question that relates about the 2015 employment-to-population ratio-I don't have any was painful, painful, painful-but would be a huge increase in the next two began.  I 2015? population ratio preceding

The forecast for the end of 2015 for the employment-to-population you were close. MR. WASCHER. ratio is 59.5 percent, so

I'll have to go back and do that again.  [Laughter] trend in the participation rate that we are carrying through we think are more MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Okay. MR. WASCHER.  In terms of the participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio, there is a long-run downward the forecast.  Some of that is demographic, some of that is other things that structural in nature.  And that contributes to the different pattern.

growth is going to past.  And the other The pickup in the employment-to-population ratio is bigger than in recent years.  I think that reflects our view that the economy is going to pick up and employment pick up and is going to generate the job gains to push that up.  And it really is more of a cyclical improvement in the employment-to-population ratio than we've seen in the part of that is, while we have this long-run downtrend in the participation rate, some of the

September 17-18, 2013

increase in employment we think is going to come from entry back into the labor force, and that is also going to contribute to it.

I see.  So there is a long-run trend that is being offset byMR. KOCHERLAKOTA. MR. WASCHER.  Yes.  And so the participation rate moves back toward its declining long-run trend over the forecast period.

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Okay.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.

you, Mr. Chairman.  My questions are also about this same Various Key Activity, Inflation, and Financial Projections,' which I I can get this right.  The way we have it is, growth, not changed very much in actual or forecast from last September; 10-year and are not changed much from last September.  But if you look at the stock market, up 10 percent, and projected to go higher.  And housing prices, not shown, are up 15 percent. wealth effect here.  But as I understand it, that doesn't really affect GDP changed.  GDP doesn't change. MR. BULLARD.  Thank page here, 'Evolution of found fascinating.  I love this summary.  Let me see if real GDP mortgage rates it's So there is a big according to this analysis.  Wealth is up a lot.  Rates haven't tighter at the moment than what we had I can get this sign right.  We have taken down the level of potential MR. WILCOX.  Resource utilization is projected.  Let me see if GDP by about ½ percentage point.  So we have the GDP gap a little narrower at the moment.

a year ago just did in the most recent projection.  And measured by the rate, rate gap is narrower.  All of this is a little murky, and we haven't spent a amount of time on it.  I'm going to run up the white flag pretty quickly here.  [Laughter] We did some of that in this most recent projection, but the revision relative to is bigger than what we unemployment rate, even taking into account the fact that we've moved down our natural our unemployment huge

September 17-18, 2013

have an economy that currently looks interest rates that are not higher than I would have thought in you only told me that the economy was a little tighter, I would have expected long why I posited the possibility that an easier stance of that you took a year ago into our September 2012 Tealbook I think it's consistent with the hypothesis that we like it is modestly tighter than what we had before, with before.  I thought, gee, that's kind of an interesting juxtaposition, since the abstract, if rates to be projected to be higher.  And that's monetary policy might be part of that, since we hadn't incorporated that major easing in the stance of monetary policy projections.

MR. BULLARD.  My question may be simpler.  This is a wealth effect on the order of $10 trillion or so.  So you're telling me this has no impact on our outlook?

I haven't taken into account and haven't had the time to delve into. MR. WILCOX.  No, I'm not saying that.  What I'm saying is, that was probably offset by a bunch of other stuff that sorry.  The exchange rate being higher of the wealth effect in rough terms.  So we also have a higher exchange Item 9 on the table there. MR. RUDD.  Could I make one interjection?  I'm offsets about two-thirds rate relative to a year ago.

I was taking it to be about the same. MR. BULLARD.

shows the path of the exchange rate is about 3¼ percent on average projection period.  And by our rules of thumb, that would offset roughly twoMR. RUDD.  Item 9 higher over the thirds of the wealth effect from the higher stock and house price paths.

MR. BULLARD.  Interesting.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any other questions?  [No response]  If not, I understand coffee is ready.  Why don't we reconvene at 3:20?  Thank you.

[Coffee break]

September 17-18, 2013

Before we begin our economic go-round, four times year we have an opportunity for people to make comments or raise questions about financial CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay. a stability issues.  And I have President Rosengren on my list first.

want to thank what I wanted one of my a wide number of central bankers who pass through over the course of the it is not as if it's an caused this problem,' that markets and how it reverberates back, because economy but on their economies as well.  And where we could do some more work that clarifies what is a reasonable the effects on our own economy would not be our policies are having on some emerging I'm hearing it in Boston, I can imagine the Governors and Vice Dudley are hearing it a lot in their travels as well.  And it would be nice to be a little as well a fair bit in this area. MR. ROSENGREN.  I am just going to make two quick comments.  First, I Steve for talking so much about emerging markets.  That is actually comments to be on.  Being in Boston, I'm the beneficiary of and economists from both Europe and emerging markets summer.  And when they talk about 'the emerging markets' swoon,' exogenous shock for emerging markets, it's more 'The Fed has frequently comes up in conversation.  And I think it probably is worth, over time, thinking about how our various policy tools do impact emerging certainly the perception abroad seems to be that quantitative easing and some of our other tools have a disproportionate impact not only on our this is probably an area expectation.  Certainly, our own assumptions of consistent with the magnified effects that they think markets.  And I think there is some academic research that has been moving in this direction, but it is probably a topic that, if Chairman bit more armed with data that could highlight how our tools might affect other countries as our own.  Just in terms of future work, I think that would be very useful, and it sounds like you are already doing

MR. KAMIN.  We are indeed, and we will be doing more.

September 17-18, 2013

Wilcox's Mine is actually more on state and Illinois, but I think it's worth keeping financing, and there are fiscal issues and the risk of grade status.  Financial stability concerns arise because roughly muni mutual funds hold Puerto Rican debt.  In fact, the recent increases in the concerned about going through some spread more broadly through municipal financial markets.  So it may Mr. Chairman. MR. ROSENGREN.  Good.  My second comment gets a little bit to David initial comments where he was talking about fiscal policy. municipal finances.  Frequently we hear about states like an eye on Puerto Rico, and I'm sure we are keeping an eye on Puerto Rico.  Puerto Rico has high debt burdens, it has a dependence on market downgrade to noninvestment 80 percent of yields would indicate that market participants have already become increasingly the outlook on that debt.  I think on the heels of the Detroit bankruptcy, a Puerto Rican default, or even a near default, particularly at the same time that fiscal policy is travails, as were highlighted in David's comments, could potentially have an impact on investor confidence and possibly just be something to keep an eye on.  Thank you, ask Eric a question? MR. TARULLO.  Can I

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Certainly.

you we need collectively to think more about it and have better answers than we MR. TARULLO.  Eric, do you have a prior on that emerging market issue, or were just suggesting that have had?

It is primarily focused on quantitative easing.  When people come are seem to think that, one, our estimates are much lower than their own MR. ROSENGREN. and talk about the impact of our quantitative easing, I talk about roughly what our estimates in terms of interest rate effects and the broader effects on the economy, which are positive but relatively modest.  They

September 17-18, 2013

economy. estimates, and, two, that the impact on their own economy is much larger than the impact that we are attributing to our effects, it does seem you could make a consistent argument that the started to swoon was around the time that we started talking better sense of what those what the magnitudes are from my own staff in cause some of the financial problems to to us-that kind of I haven't spent a lot of time thinking about, but it certainly is a lot of time thinking about. Looking at the timing time that the emerging markets about our tapering program.  It seems like it is worth getting a connections are, what the magnitudes are.  I know terms of what we're thinking about for the effects on our own economy.  But thinking about how it might reverberate and how that could potentially actually become more severe in emerging markets and possibly circle back reverberation effect is something something that colleagues from abroad seem to be spending

assume we have looked at the impacts on the way in-that is, LSAPs and the flows into the emerging markets. MR. TARULLO.  Steve, I as we were starting on capital easing has been one of the factors pushing capital that have been at play as rising.  Basically, we have been looking at the relationship between emerging EME bit more than might be explained just by our easing in the early period. researching. MR. KAMIN.  Yes.  Well, we've been researching the impact of our easing flows to EMEs.  Our sense is that certainly our toward EMEs, but not the only factor.  Another is just that they have higher steady-state rates of growth than we do.  More recently, we have been looking at the factors rates have been market asset prices, both on the way down and on the way up.  Our sense is that probably asset prices moved up a And then with the swoon, they have probably moved down a bit more than might be explained by the run-up in U.S. interest rates.  So this is something we are actively

you. MR. TARULLO.  Thank

September 17-18, 2013

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.

enjoyed Mike's presentation.  It was very useful.  I especially liked some of staff were doing in terms of following up on initiatives generated in MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a few comments on financial stability.  I the discussion at the very end of what related to pockets of concern.  It's useful to see the mapping between what's being the report and actions being taken.  I thought President Evans's questions were useful along those lines as well.

also think that the discussion of financial stability that appears before the a great starting point for trying to build in financial considerations into our thinking about monetary policy.  I've mentioned this before.  I would be useful to translate the discussion into at least crude quantitative risk to prices and employment.  And by crude, I mean something like, is there a 1financial crisis with significant macroeconomic consequences in the next 1-in-10 chance-orders-of-magnitude kinds of ideas. And I alternative simulations in the Tealbook is stability continue to think that it measures of in-1,000 chance of a two years, 1-in-100 chance, possible instability.  We often hear the suggestion that we can mitigate incipient financial monetary policy, but there's quite a tricky term issue here, right?  If it's are not supposed to tighten.  We're supposed to ease.  So right away, you see I think we've seen tightening of monetary policy since early May.  Ten-year yields have risen by more than 100 basis points.  This increase has been accompanied rates as largely attributable to a noticeable tightening of monetary policy. the inflation breakevens.  The Fed is now expected to keep interest rates My next comment is about this issue of using monetary policy to mitigate financial instability by tightening right on us, we subtleties there.  But Treasury by at most a slight improvement in the macroeconomic outlook.  So it seems reasonable to interpret the increase in We see this, too, in

September 17-18, 2013

for a wider range of macroeconomic outlooks.  So when I think about tightening, I don't are going to do for a wide range expected to follow a tighter policy for a wide range of I indicated earlier, in the higher term premium as well. higher just think about our benchmark outlook.  I think about what we of possible outlooks, and I think we're outlooks, and that's reflected, as has this tightening of policy affected financial stability?  Now, we have would say that measures of risk and risk appetite have actually risen in the past three or you look at the equity premium, it's fallen even though the VIX has risen. of risky bonds really haven't changed very much, so it may be hard to read much into yield among financial institutions.  The basic problem here was that income from mortgage medium-term loans because for medium-term loans.  So tightening policy at the long end of more pressure on profits, and in that sense exacerbated the reaching-forBut anyway, how a lot of different tools, so it's not a suggestion about only one of them, but the effects seem quite mixed.  I four months.  If Spreads that.  We heard reports that the increase in long rates was actually increasing incentives to reach for duration had fallen sharply because of the increase in mortgage rates, but, at the same time, the financial institutions could not earn that much interest income from interest rates were still very low the curve had really put yield problem.

are also ways in which the won't talk about that.  I'm not taking a going to affect financial system you go to the you tighten monetary policy, you can control financial I've highlighted some senses in which we haven't seen a diminution in financial system vulnerabilities because of the tightening of monetary policy.  There increase in long rates has reduced financial system risk.  I stand on whether they, on balance, increase or decrease risks.  My point is a more limited one. We don't have a clear understanding of how monetary policy is vulnerability.  This idea that's out there in the blogosphere-and actually even if movies there's this idea out there-that if

September 17-18, 2013

lot more understanding and a lot more study of this before we can reach system risks.  We need a that simple conclusion.

wouldn't want to rely on monetary The best way the FOMC can eliminating monetary policy uncertainty.  Unfortunately, I opposite direction on that in the past few months.  We've increased about monetary policy as opposed to decreased it.  In my view, we can best reduce following a clear strategy that's focused on achieving our dual the medium term, but I'll talk about that more tomorrow. My own view is, with all of these uncertainties, I policy tightening at this point as a way to deal with these risks. ameliorate financial system risks is by feel we've moved in the uncertainty that policy uncertainty by mandate objectives over

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President George.

going to comments.  I would say to President Rosengren there were some papers that came I thought were relevant to his issue with the EMEs. MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In the interest of time, I'm abbreviate my out of the Jackson Hole Symposium that

I wanted to make really are all present in the QS report.  Just a reminder that couple of areas that I still am focused on, and one has to do with the earnings pressure I'm particularly looking at a region, and that is community and regional banks. a growing asset-liability mismatch, which increases the interest rate risk I'm looking at continuing longer-term loans being booked over this period, in addition The points even as we've seen the uptick in rates that took some of the valuation pressure out of the market, there are a that comes from low net interest margins in this rate environment. group of banks that are very prominent in my We're continuing to see exposure; to longer-term securities.

I would just elaborate on is farmland prices, and the thing I would grow despite the fact that expectations for falling farm The other area that note here is that these prices continue to

September 17-18, 2013

this time.  When I look at these land prices now, we saw in the 1980s.  The price-to-rent ratios exceed the long-term record amounts in many of the Corn Belt states.  Acknowledging that there because of the lack of leverage, I think the significant. incomes are becoming more widespread at they're well above what averages really by are probably not, at this stage, broad stability risks implications of any decline in these valuations at a regional level could be some of the comments about the risk we see in the know supervisors are looking at that, but those really are symptomatic yield with the covenants and the high debt multiples that we see.  Thank you. Finally, I would just echo again leveraged loan market.  I of this reach for

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Evans.

I was concerned assessment of how long going to subscribe to our forward-guidance threshold.  I don't know the size of it, but I think that's an unintended reaction to the communications that four months.  But then I'll note Vice Chairman Dudley's maybe, because issues, we might have to back down on the credibility of our forwardpercent.  So that's one reason why I thought it was important to ask our regulatory and supervisory behavior has been toward potential credibility implications for our MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I had mentioned before that about monitoring the credibility of our forward-guidance tools for monetary policy.  Based on some of the comments Simon made in his Desk presentation, it looks like the announcement of potential reductions in our flow purchase rate have altered markets' we're that's a little bit of a concern. we've made in the past three or comment, also during that discussion.  He mentioned anecdotal comments that of financial stability guidance threshold of 6½ about what the status of financial instability developments in these markets because it has monetary policy tools.

September 17-18, 2013

greatly from these past are monitoring so many things.  Just going back to the go up by 100 basis points?  And experience.  It was a little rugged, but there's no more risk because of a little less.  Maybe we're in a better position because of that.  There are have been taken.  Perhaps they were long intended with the SNC there is also interest rate risk guidance.  So I think that's helped. agency REITs from the increase in interest rates and, whether that of an effect as we feared, that was a good thing.  There market liquidity issues that we've been concerned about due to Dodd-Frank, and now the dealers are unwilling to engage in those transactions.  If going to be that way, they're going to be that way. I think this has been an important discussion.  We've benefited several financial stability briefings.  We March briefing, we had a list of concerns.  What if interest rates we've gone through that that.  Maybe the risk is supervisory actions that leveraged loan guidance, but We have seen difficulties with was self-correcting or it just wasn't as big are evidence is that it's actually just that they're it but, like President Kocherlakota, I think it ought concerns that kicks in before we any of the staff's a much would we have to degrade our monetary policy tools?  Thank you, It doesn't look like there's an outsized concern now for financial stability.  That's important.  We'll have to continue to monitor to be something much larger in terms of financial instability allow it to degrade our monetary policy tools.  I would also welcome greatly assessments about what the relative tradeoffs are in order to reduce financial instability by certain likelihood.  How Mr. Chairman.

no other contributions to this round, we President Lacker. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Seeing can start the economic go-round with comments we've contacts over the intermeeting period was consistent with the noticeable MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The overall tenor of received from our

September 17-18, 2013

I reported at our July meeting.  Compared with earlier in the year, the reports are At the July meeting, I noted that our business activity surveys were effects they are are far smaller than first feared. improvement uniformly more positive. fairly downbeat.  They've snapped back into positive territory since then and are now more consistent with other regional and national surveys.  We've heard a lot about the sequestration from our District contacts in recent months.  They now say that the sequestration seeing in their regions

I got and the expansion we're going to get, and that means real GDP growth at The Tealbook continues to forecast a significant increase in real growth I remain skeptical. The projection I submitted for the national economy is nearly identical to the one submitted in June.  To boil it down to basics, I think the expansion we've seen so far is the expansion we've around 2 to 2¼ percent. over the next few quarters, but diminishes in coming I'm not that optimistic.  The spending restraint due to sequestration seems to be a much less significant effect on activity than we expected.  It shows up in the data as I mentioned earlier.  Spending is expected to fall over the next The other component of waning fiscal drag is the passage of time since the tax On the fiscal front, we could see a slight boost to growth as drag quarters, but having well as in the anecdotal reports two years. increases at the beginning of the year.

would note that the Tealbook is looking for consumer spending to accelerate in advance gains in home prices and equity values, without a broad-based revision in households' assessments of the I believe that the year, in other years.  For a given GDP growth rate, productivity I of any acceleration in disposable income.  Despite recent this strikes me as unlikely downside risks to labor income.  Even with growth in the low 2s,  however, unemployment rate will continue to decline by about ¾ percentage point per words, at about the same pace as in recent

September 17-18, 2013

growth, and as I've discussed in previous meetings, I see no growth to accelerate. growth pins down employment reason to expect productivity affecting the rate of decline in unemployment is the labor force across age and gender It turns out that once you control for the effects of age, gender, and year of between actual and cyclical effects holding down participation have year in the sample period, but it's true right now, and that force participation is no mystery at all, and it a reasonably good measure of labor market The other factor participation rate.  This is something we've been paying more attention to in recent meetings. Some economists have argued that labor force participation is far below trend right now, and that as a result, there's an additional measure of underutilization of resources to which we ought to be paying attention.  Recent research by Richmond Fed economists has made me quite skeptical of this argument, however.  We know that labor force participation varies groups.  We also know that people born at different times have displayed very different participation rates. birth in a conventional way, there's very little remaining discrepancy now predicted labor force participation.  That is, any dissipated.  This isn't true for every suggests to me that the recent behavior of labor also suggests that the unemployment rate is conditions right now.

next few years, not flatten out as in the Tealbook.  So I expect the year for a couple of first quarter, which is more than a decision tomorrow. Looking forward, this framework projects that the labor force participation rate will continue to fall over the unemployment rate to continue to decline by about ¾ percentage point per years.  That means an unemployment rate of 7.0 percent in the year earlier than the staff or the SEP was forecasting in September 2012.  To me this has obvious implications for our policy

MR. TARULLO.  Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor.

your database, Jeff, on the basis of which you can make those granular assessments of who's participating in the labor market? MR. TARULLO.  What's very standard database on this, and they've done it with both flows from the CPS.  You just take out these fixed effects for age, gender groups, and for birth year, by cohort.  Just take out those three fixed effects, and what you line, and the predicted rate lines up with the actual right now. MR. LACKER.  It's the and levels data do the same thing get is a predicted line and an actual

gap is about ½ percentage point in you some different answers, depending on what you MR. WASCHER.  We have a similar model where we do that, and we include some other variables as well.  I think our current participation rate the Tealbook.  So different models can get include.

There has been little change in the path of the recovery in the Third District since our July meeting.  Our region's story growth at a moderate pace.  Housing rebounded over the past four months.  The outlook remains quite positive among our business contacts.  All of the Philadelphia states both improving Our Business Outlook Survey, which remains confidential until 10:00 a.m. on Thursday, has been finalized and shows broad-based strength.  The general activity index, which had been 9.3 in August, jumped to 22.3 in September.  And the indexes for new orders, shipments, and employment all jumped significantly in the most recent survey, suggesting

September 17-18, 2013

The general activity index consecutive months of positive readings, after being in negative territory also posted significant gains. economic conditions and, at some level, accelerating improvement. has now posted four earlier in the year.  The indexes of future activity a relatively strong recovery in our region.  So a major impact on Third District on refinances.  House prices are rising.

My staff is forecasting the next at this meeting because we have communicated forward guidance on our asset course we laid out to the incoming data since meeting has led me to make a minor adjustment in my near-term forecast for 2013 but adjusted my 2013 forecast down two-tenths of The Committee's economic projections for the national economy take on more significance purchases in terms of our June economic projections.  The fundamental question is whether we have revised our forecast enough to warrant deviating from the policy public in June.  In my view, the answer to that is no.  My assessment of the our July no change in my outlook over the medium term.  I

well within normal in our point forecast for growth is in no sense significant.  In fact, the for the current year is year ahead, it's 150 basis points.  The basic forecast we laid out I believe that forecast is still intact.  I anticipate growth will pick up to about 3 percent year before returning to a steady-state growth rate of about 2½ percent in 2015 and '16. a percentage point, down to 2.4 percent, but the size and revision is certainly error bands.  Two-tenths average historical root mean squared error for forecasts made in September more than 80 basis points.  For a in June led us to conclude that it would be appropriate to begin reducing the pace of purchases this fall. next

I project the unemployment rate will continue to decline, much as President reaching 7 percent by the end of this the end of 2014, and 6 percent in 2015 and '16, which I Although inflation remains low, I project it to gradually increase back toward 2 percent through the rest of our board the Committee's forward guidance.  I expect us to end early next year, at which point the unemployment rate will be at or below 7 percent, I see the economy steady state late in 2015, my policy path calls for a gradual increase over the next years, less steep than implied by a traditional policy rule, but steeper than what is in the returning to its neutral rate, which I see as about 4 percent, end of 2016. I have generally taken on purchases and we'd begin to raise the federal funds rate when the unemployment rate reaches 6½ percent. According to my forecast, that will be in the second half of 2014.  Although returning to its three Tealbook.  And I have the funds rate by the

2013 through 2015 about ¼ percentage point per year.  The The Tealbook forecast has also changed only a little since June.  The staff has reduced their growth forecast for unemployment rate forecast is slightly lower than it was in June, as we heard.  PCE inflation is

September 17-18, 2013

any meaningful sense.  The Tealbook forecast projected two-tenths of a percentage point higher in 2013 but lower by a similar amount in 2014 and 2015.  None of these changes is significant in incorporates both our tapering plans laid out in June and the subsequent run-up in interest rates.

as well as the dealers, are anticipating that we gave in June.  We cannot turn back the clock and convey any forward guidance in June, and now decide that it isn't In my view, based on the incoming data, it would be very follow through with the plan we laid out without losing credibility. Indeed, most private-sector forecasters, will begin to reduce the pace of purchases at this meeting.  Thus, they see incoming data as consistent with the forward guidance we proceed as if we did not appropriate to taper with the June outlook.  We have already made that decision.  To maintain our credibility, a deviation from the policy path we laid out in June has to be argued on the basis of a significant change in the forecast. hard to deploy a substantially different outlook from what we have projected in June.  Thus, I don't see how we cannot view.  First, argue that interest rates have risen more than you would have liked.  And when we a market reaction in June after by not doing anything and attempt to ease financial conditions game to be playing.  We don't control over market expectations.  We need to be quite humble about our ability to from our credibility and our willingness to follow through on our promises. One might think of two reasons for delay, and neither is compelling in my you may started to discuss the possibility of tapering, indeed, we did see the meeting.  Rates have been rising since the employment report of May 3.  You might argue that we could surprise the markets and bring short-term rates back down.  I think this is a very risky have tight anticipate, let alone control, market expectations.  The little effect we do have on expectations derives directly Unless we can make a compelling argument that the forecast for the economy has changed significantly from June, not following through on our forward guidance risks creating further

In other words, moving the goalpost or our reaction function undermines the efficacy of our forward guidance. uncertainty about our policy reaction function.  Such uncertainty It current creating confusion about argue it is better to wait and gather some more data, as suggested in a act in the coming months?  Markets will surely you're not acting now, what will cause you to react in coming for years, is that the data will continue to come in consistent with moderate growth, with year or so.  I don't Second, one might alternative B.  After all, we still have the opportunity to do a reduction in the pace of purchases later in the fall, which would be consistent with our forward guidance.  And I think we have problem here, because on what basis would we want to know pretty precisely, if months?  To my mind, the most probable outcome for the coming months, and perhaps several monthly variations up and down, similar to what we have seen over the past think it is likely we will see a much stronger case for following through with our forward guidance in December than we have right now.

would we choose to act in coming months?  It just seems unlikely to that another $500 billion or another $2 trillion in purchases will launch produce such a result. sheet expand we truly prepared for such an eventuality? So on what grounds me that we will see the kind of breakout set of numbers that make the decision obvious.

Thus, we will be contributing to policy uncertainty market volatility as market participants The public will be increasingly confused about our plans for asset purchases and our reaction function.  The credibility and, thus, the effectiveness of our forward guidance could be undermined, and our balance sheet will taper and eventually end purchases.  And when we do, you will have to bear all of those costs again.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

They are seeing business activity, and quickly what we heard, our contacts can be described as apprehensively optimistic.  This represents a slight pullback from sentiment before the trajectories that are in essence very similar to the first half.

I said as I began, my reading of the key data leaves me ambivalent.  I can make the context for export growth.  Business demand for government spending has shrunk measurably.  Industrial activity is improving along a slowing from the revised second-quarter estimate and signal a slowing of hiring.  The glass can be seen as half empty or half circumstance in which to make the policy decision we face this meeting. As case for believing in a pickup in growth.  Growth seems to have strengthened in Europe and stabilized in China, adding to an encouraging fixed capital appears to be improving.  The drag on GDP growth from combined federal, state, and local several dimensions.  At the same time, our current tracking estimates, and those of others, for GDP growth in the third quarter suggest cast significant doubt on the assumption of a pickup in the second half.  Also, the recent employment report may full, and I think that is an agonizing at modestly downgraded my 2013 growth forecast but held to a growth over the forecast horizon.  My projection of growth, however, is not as early or as strong as the Tealbook.  My forecast for the percent in the middle year.  So in my overall growth and employment outlook, I am sticking to an optimistic of my District contacts, with some apprehension. In my SEP submission, I basic outlook of a pickup in the pace of accelerating unemployment rate is similar to the Tealbook in the near term, crossing 7 of next narrative but, like many

On a headline basis, the Tealbook projection year-over-year headline objective in eight of the previous nine I find this troubling, and I find it as fodder for the half-empty interpretation. returning to target by 2015 rather than remaining below 2 percent for longer as in the Tealbook.

as consistent with the St. Louis view and the Tealbook view District contacts associated with global businesses suggested that, on balance, international conditions have stabilized in recent weeks.

They nevertheless project that inflation will move back toward target as the economy continues to improve.  Importantly, I think improvements in the global macroeconomic outlook, combined with a continuation of our aggressively easing monetary policy, will drive inflation expectations and actual inflation higher in the quarters ahead.  However, I prefer to see more tangible to policy action based on this scenario.  For this reason, I will be counseling patience during the policy round at this meeting.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

As a result, the broad July meeting, and little changed since the continue to expect GDP growth to pick up over time, which will rate down toward its natural rate and pull inflation up toward our 2 similar to the Tealbook outlook. MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In keeping recovery, much of the contours of my forecast are little changed since our previous SEP submission.  I bring the unemployment percent objective, broadly firming.  Today's CPI release was about as I had Bank's median CPI inflation measure been for the past two years.  The recent declines in the I had anticipated, causing me to edge down my Recent inflation data appear to be expected, and it increasingly looks like third-quarter inflation measures will rebound, whether we look at CPI, PCE, headline, or core inflation.

September 17-18, 2013

I believe the risks to the outlook for growth, unemployment, I've made relative to my previous forecast.  But since we launched the asset purchase program in September of 2012, these small adjustments have year ago, both labor market conditions and the the labor market have improved considerably, as David pointed out in his As to the balance of risks, and inflation remain broadly balanced.  I have often found myself saying that changes to my outlook have been small current accumulated.  Compared with the situation a outlook for presentation.

risen from a six-month average of 97,000 at the time of our September 2012 measured by the unemployment rate.  And while we remain concerned force has grown by more than 800,000 people I have lowered my forecast for the year from 7.9 percent in my September 2012 as of this meeting.  The Tealbook's forecast of unemployment has a similar amount since September of last year, and its forecast of payroll employment year has risen by more than 1 million jobs.  Now, it is true that recent payroll I am expecting this slowing to be temporary. Over the past 12 months, the economy has added more than 2 million jobs, as the pace of payroll gains has meeting to about 160,000 today.  Unemployment has declined by more than 1 million people or 0.8 percentage point, as about the labor force participation rate, the labor since last fall.  In response to these improvements, unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of this projection to 7.2 percent shifted by at the end of this gains have slowed, but generally report a sense of cautious optimism, and a variety of outlook in general, and labor markets in particular, support this view. continuing at a strong pace and, even with the recent increase in mortgage and nonmanufacturing My District contacts indicators about both the The auto recovery is rates, housing affordability does remain high.  Both the manufacturing ISM surveys have been encouraging the past two months, with the nonmanufacturing survey

And initial claims for even before the recent computer glitch that clocking in at survey's employment index is near post-recession highs.  Small businesses in the August NFIB survey reported the strongest percentage of hiring unemployment insurance hit a post-recession low lowered them even more.

According to that force participation and the unemployment rate have a correlation of pattern holds, the continued economic recovery will consist of both a further reduction in the unemployment rate and outlook for the labor market clearly has implications for our monetary policy, tomorrow's go-round to share my views on policy.

No one is talking about upside or a substantial downside over the firms see demand concerning softened over the past six weeks.

We still appear to be muddling along without demand, so they see no pressure to hire workers or invest in new capital In terms of the national somewhat disappointing.  On the upside, the second quarter turned out better than we were expecting, although 2½ percent Tealbook seems to be expecting, probably overstates the forward momentum.  A softening tone of much of the more signs that a more vigorous recovery is building.  That was the objective, after all.  July and August payroll employment gains were disappointing.  Taken as a whole, these reports are not indicative of a vibrant, sustainable labor market.  Businesses have adequate capacity and staffing to meet current levels of until more customers actually walk through the door, and that's not the case at the moment.

I think the past few months of spending growth, we shouldn't assume in financial conditions.  The increased restrictiveness of financial conditions risk. Consumer expenditures have decelerated noticeably. data are pretty worrisome.  That's also the situation with the latest consumer confidence data. And while autos and housing have been sources of strength for auto sales, home construction, and housing prices will continue to climb at their recent pace given the tightening is a significant downside

I view this exercise as flawed.  I I would truly consider appropriate 2 percent and unemployment falling below the natural rate.  I certainly cheer those Regarding our SEP submission, you will again note that couldn't bring myself to write down a forecast with what monetary policy.  For me, that would exhibit some overshooting, with inflation going at least a little above participants who did submit something like that.

Thank you.  We accept your applause.

Indeed, these asset price responses share of the transmission mechanism from tighter financial conditions to the economy resulting from higher rates in the FRB/US model.  But in the current episode of equity prices have not declined, house prices have continued to rise, and the dollar has appreciated only very modestly. materializing, the effects of the increase in longer-term interest rates on the economy are likely to be far more muted than the FRB/US the effects of the recent increase in longer-term rates on the outlook for the economy.

So Jeremy's One puzzling aspect of this improvement in the labor market has been the growth in real GDP, which many people have mentioned already.  Jeremy very Real gross domestic income has grown nearly 2.7 percent over the past four quarters, about 1 percentage point above that of real GDP.  Jeremy's is in many respects a better indicator of the overall output of the economy than is GDP.  In fact, in a recent paper with coauthors, he percent weight on GDI in the economy-it's a very sophisticated analysis.  My own preliminary research using Laubach-Williams model

We haven't looked at the transition economic health of these three states than their continued caution from local business contacts regarding possible in growth and hiring largely grounded in concerns about revenue.

I think one skepticism that you hear-maybe less in this you'll hear it-is that adding monetary accommodation may not are reasons for concern in this dimension when one 2009, but basically it's the same as population growth, and that's what it that the employment-to-population ratio has remained basically the same.

I said, these data have led some observers to the pessimistic conclusion that policy good news is that this flatness of the years.  The unemployment rate overstates it.  If you look at the people who are of 25 and 54, you get a brighter picture.  The employment-to-population ratio As stimulus cannot improve labor market outcomes.  I think the employment-to-population ratio understates the degree of improvement in the labor market over the past few between the ages in this group is about 20 percent back to its 2007 level from its 2009 nadir.

First, the earlier the most recent trend the past few months is lower observations drop year-over-year rate is likely to drift upwards.

And, third, inflation expectations I must admit the five-year, five-year forward has drifted down a little watching.  So the fact that inflation is a bit below our 2 percent get that much weight from me in my monetary policy views. With respect to the inflation outlook, I'm not particularly troubled by the fact that core PCE inflation is somewhat below our objective downtrend appears to have bottomed out because above the year-over-year growth rate.  As time passes and the earlier, out, the the inflation data, it shows that the across core remain pretty well anchored above the current core PCE rate, which should exert some upward pull on inflation, although bit recently, and so that deserves objective doesn't really

If so, job growth may enjoyed earlier this year, unless output growth strengthens substantially.  Of And it is worth recalling that for the past two years, the initially reported gains were revised up substantially over the following two months. MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The data we have received since our July meeting have been mostly further decline in the unemployment rate, but, as others have noted, several beneath the surface of the past two employment reports. payroll gains suggests that productivity well continue to move down in coming quarters, rather than reverting to the near 200,000 per month pace we course, seasonal adjustment issues appear to be particularly challenging during the summer months, so it is rash to jump to the conclusion that the pace of improvement in the labor market has in fact slowed. August nonfarm payroll slowed over the summer.  Mortgage rates have risen yet further since meeting, and it seems increasingly likely that the soft tone in housing starts and home apparent slowing in the pace of house price gains, may reflect restraint from But it is also possible that the weaker tone of those reports and incoming data on spending portend yet another episode in an all-too-long series of disappointments pertaining to the momentum of the recovery.  It is worrisome that household spending outside of motor vehicles appears to have our July sales, as well as the those higher rates.

cut my modal outlook for real activity relative to my June SEP submission. from the tightening in financial conditions since June, real activity and inflation are now associated with a somewhat lower path I had anticipated in my previous SEP.  In other words, I expect yet greater patience on our part will be required in removing accommodation. Despite the recent disappointing data flow, I have and inflation over the forecast horizon only slightly However, in light of the restraint resulting these trajectories for for the federal funds rate than that remarks, I would like to highlight a striking feature of the Tealbook baseline, I made earlier.  That's be for many years to come for the economy to an important role in our communications pertaining to our forward guidance.  The question The downward shift in the funds rate path I have incorporated in my SEP is broadly consistent with the revisions since June in the Tealbook baseline path for the funds rate.  In the remainder of my which is close to my SEP submission and along the lines of the comments just how low the real federal funds rate path must achieve our maximum employment and 2 percent longer-run inflation objectives.  This is the point that President Kocherlakota just made.  I'll argue that this feature of the forecast ought to play is:  Just why does the funds rate path in the Tealbook baseline remain so low for so long?  To answer this question, I thought it would be instructive to examine the implied path of the equilibrium real funds rate, or r * for short, along the Tealbook path.

September 17-18, 2013

This measure currently stands at late 2016, 2 percentage points end of 2018, it is only around 1¼ percent.  I would consistent with other as President Williams noted, the Laubach-Williams estimate of  * model forecasts that end of 2016 ranging from around ½ to 1½ The measure of r * reported in the Tealbook is defined as 'the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would return output to potential in 12 quarters.' minus 1.6 percent.  Tealbook does not report how r * evolves over time, so I asked the staff to compute the path of r * in the extended Tealbook baseline.  As it turns out, this rate rises only gradually over time.  By r * reaches a level near zero, still roughly below its long-run value.  And even by the note that the prolonged depression of r * in the Tealbook baseline appears estimates.  For example, r currently stands around minus ½ percentage point.  And the four DSGE were updated for this meeting suggest r * at the percent-President Kocherlakota pointed this out too.

And it would reach 2¼ percent account for the shortfall r * from its long-run value of around 2 percent federal funds rate remains near zero, even at the end of 2016 One might think that if by unemployment of its are no such I see three lessons learned from this exercise.  Lesson one is that it helps to explain why in the Tealbook outlook the real when resource slack has largely disappeared and inflation is moving up to our 2 percent objective. r * were near its 2 percent longer-run value in the Tealbook and the Committee's modal SEP projections, a near zero real funds rate in 2016 as the economy is approaching full employment would cause a substantial undershoot natural rate and an eventual overshoot of our 2 percent inflation objective.  But there under- and overshoots in the Tealbook baseline.

I am just really repeating what gradual path along which the funds rate returns FOMC is intentionally committing to a path for abatement of headwinds.  Fortuitously, the funds rate Lesson two is that the r * is still severely depressed only because monetary policy takes this fact into before President Kocherlakota told us.  Importantly, the to its longer-run normal level of 4 percent in the Tealbook baseline is not any reflection of a Woodfordian monetary policy in which the future short-term interest rates that entails an overshoot of our 2 percent inflation objective.  The optimal control path in the Tealbook does possess this feature, but it entails a substantially lower path for the real federal funds rate than the Tealbook baseline.  Rather, the gradual increase in the funds rate in the Tealbook baseline is simply a time-consistent response to evolving economic conditions, particularly the slow

MR. POWELL.  Mr. Chairman, there was a two-hander here.

tell a headwinds story, then you would also that that's going to slow the pace at which inflation is going to return to target and at MR. BULLARD.  Governor Yellen, usually if we say which the output gap is going to close.

MS. YELLEN.  And it does.

complicated headwinds story in which these variables there are still headwinds at work that are I'm following your story MR. BULLARD.  You're telling a move all the way back to normal values, but somehow keeping the real funds rate at this low level.  And so I'm not sure because of that.

I'm simply describing the Tealbook I'm wrong.  What's going on in the Tealbook are gradually abating.  Now, at the present time, an them because of the zero bound.  So, we are not able to bring this economy to full will abate over time.  And as they abate over time, we are able a low value of the real funds rategoals. MS. YELLEN.  I'm telling a story, and I believe baseline, and David and others can correct me if baseline is that there are headwinds, and they those headwinds are so strong-resulting in r * of minus 1.6 percent-that we cannot totally offset employment.  But the headwinds to leave the zero bound.  Now, by the end of 2016, by having it is exactly what Narayana said-the headwinds are still there, but by keeping the real federal funds rate well below its long-run level of 2 percent, we succeed in combating them and achieving our

September 17-18, 2013

goals, say by the end of 2016 and the years after that, in the baseline, and go back to a 4 percent funds rate with 2 percent inflation.  But in the years before that, the goals, but the setting of our policy that is required to do so entails a real funds rate Now, once we have achieved our those headwinds continue to abate.  And as they continue to abate, we need to raise the real federal funds rate in order to stay where we want to be.  So over time, from 2016 out through, say, I don't know when exactly, maybe 2020-by then, they are fully gone we economy is where we want it to be, at full employment with 2 percent inflation.  We are achieving our that is lower than the long-run 2 percent.

I appreciate that story.  Maybe this is a question for David pace at which our other key variables are a system where this thing comes back to steady state.  We've still MR. BULLARD.  Okay. Wilcox, but why isn't this also slowing down the coming back?  See, you've got got the policy rate at the low level.  Normally, you would think if those headwinds were in place, everything would go more slowly back to steady state, including policy.

in the projection is MR. WILCOX.  I think the simple answer is that monetary policy endogenous to the existence of the headwinds.  Were it not for the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, it would not be the case that the resource utilization gap would have come back to zero, and that inflation would be headed back toward the 2 percent objective.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  We have agreement.  Governor Tarullo.

you, Mr. Chairman.  Like many others, I found the data that become available between June and today not clearly establishing the steady improvement majority of the Committee at the June meeting. suggests that as a group we are sticking with that basic narrative, albeit part of the group, sticking to a projection of modest to moderate over the next couple of years.  But I suspect MR. TARULLO.  Thank have contemplated by the baseline projections of the But the preliminary SEP with the improvement delayed a bit, and less optimism about the upper range of that improvement.  And I'm increases in GDP and declines in unemployment

September 17-18, 2013

us-and I think the staff also, as reflected in the Tealbook-have less certainty around I, at least, tried to ask myself what new many of that projection than we had back in June.  So, once again, we find ourselves revisiting the possible explanations for why that may be the case.  And evidence there may be for any of these possibilities.

as mixed toward the disappointing end as we think.  There is always the as David mentioned in his initial presentation. One explanation is that the numbers we have been receiving are somewhat misleading, so maybe things aren't possibility of noisiness in the data, of course, something that is apparently more than usually likely with August employment numbers, a different take on the possibility of the numbers being misleading was, as John mentioned a moment ago, put forth in an interesting staff presentation at yesterday's a little bit ISM numbers, which have been a bit of a bright spot in the gray data of late. Quite Williams Board meeting.  It suggested that actual output may have been understated by the GDP numbers of late, and that the higher GDI numbers are, based on past observation, likely better predictors of what future GDP will look like than our current GDP numbers themselves.  There is of support for that hypothesis in the otherwise very

'Supply-side damage' hypothesis, years.  My view has been that the longer I have also been of really further.  And, thus, there's been no near-term implication for monetary policy. The second explanation is what the Tealbook calls the and we've talked about this one a lot over the past few unemployment stayed elevated, the labor market impaired, and business fixed investment relatively low, the more likely it was that there would be some lasting structural damage to the economy following on from the major dislocations of 2008 and 2009.  But the view that, given the amount of slack that still likely remains in the economy, we're not able to judge how much damage there has been and won't be until the recovery has proceeded a fair ways

September 17-18, 2013

basic way, but that provides some evidence of current, as opposed to inferred or while, that was actually something of a rebuttal to structural damage arguments. while probably largely attributable to the expiration of extended UI but now else.  Neither of these changes in the transition destinations of the longbear watching over the next couple of quarters. My bottom line on the structural damage hypothesis hasn't changed in any there is one piece of data anticipated, structural damage effects.  That is the pattern of exit from long-term unemployment. For quite a Recently, though, the transition rate of the long-term unemployed to employment has dipped down a bit, more so when considered relative to the exit rate of the short-term unemployed, and the transition rate of the long-term unemployed out of the labor force has continued to tick up. The latter was for a may reflect something term unemployed is dramatic, but they probably following the crisis, which impede recovery.  Presumably, the difference guess you could make the case that, after a while, headwinds I'm not going to go down that road.  The kind of headwind most obviously a financial crisis aftermath is that there are high amounts of debt at households, harder to manage in the face of asset values and income.  But once balance sheet repair progresses far enough, that firms, at least large ones, sitting on a lot of cash, and good case for the proposition that the repair process should A third explanation has been loosely stated-the headwinds explanation of factors unleashed by or between headwinds and structural damage is that the latter cannot be counteracted with more fiscal or monetary stimulus, whereas the former can-hence, the implicit metaphor of an airplane throttling up to maintain speed.  I cause damage, but characteristic of financial firms, and nonfinancial firms, all of which becomes declining headwind should abate.  With nonfinancial financial firms having been strengthened substantially, and household income-to-debt ratios back to about 2003 levels, there is a pretty

a sustained steeper path of recovery began to seem year.  I knew Janet's intervention was coming, so I haven't had all of this myself, but as Janet just reminded us, we are facing a different set of to provide a different explanation.  Some, such as the extent of fiscal a offset with continued monetary stimulus.  The good bit of slack in the economy.  And, as has been for some time, this presumption continues to be supported by what I might term a more decomposed form, as revealed in a growth, which shows that none of the skewing that to see toward the upper end, where sectoral pockets of labor shortages lead to This is probably the main reason why more plausible to me earlier this to try to develop headwinds that continue tightening, have blown up since the recession ended.  And others, such as the very slow recovery of the housing industry, continue to blow even after the rain has stopped, like the tail-end of hurricane.  These headwinds, presumably, can be headwinds hypothesis, of course, presumes a the case negative piece of evidence-that is, the absence of any indication of wage pressures.  This is true not only in the aggregate, but also in a somewhat plotting of the distribution of average wage one might expect significant wage increases, has actually occurred.

explanations, and the relative each over time will, thus, obviously be critical to our decisions.  For now, though, greater aggregate demand.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I suspect there is something to each of these three importance of I don't think that the recent run of fairly disappointing data has changed the basic story of an economy still in need of

We do have an offset in terms of federal payrolls, but the growth in terms of and the decline in unemployment is not being led by energy, it is being computers and autos and exports.

I do want to warn my colleagues that unless we see more favorable tax additional employment come to employment.  But treatment, here's just one instance where we're likely to see that a screeching halt in 2014.

glass being half empty, I'm more on the wavelength of President Williams and President Pianalto.  With wavelength, Governor Yellen and Governor Tarullo.  That I cannot say that we've had economic reports on the disappointing side over the last finances, pent-up demand for consumer durable and capital recovery.  We heard Now, I've heard so many people around the table talk about the and I must say all due respect, I'm less on your means several months.  We've had sustained low real interest rates, abundant credit, improved household and strong corporate goods, and to me that provides the basis for an acceleration in the pace of around this table concerns about Europe and several major Asian economies and financial systems.  They still linger, but in several instances they have begun to abate.

We heard from President Pianalto about NFIB small businesses'

Initial claims have most recent report, which had some you know, due to the computer systems in two states.  Year-over-year real GDP growth-has improved. ISM numbers that you mentioned, Governor Tarullo, have increased, and as far as inflation Since our July meeting reference point we have continued to trend downward with the exception of the oddities, as growth-and very importantly, as President Williams mentioned, GDI The

And then, very importantly, one of the subjects I continue to monitor, which is the spread on junk debt, has continued to narrow. is concerned, it not only PCE inflation month rate of that heard from several of our interlocutors I would easing, not tightening.  Let you some statistics.  The latest pre-FOMC financial Board briefing notes that 'net Financial Stability, 'SLOOS responses indicate that the easing of standards compiled by four of our Federal Reserve Banks financial stress is well below average.  They showed a generally modest indexes, between June and August. And that puts me onto financial conditions.  I've at this table that we have increased restrictiveness; financial conditions have tightened. submit that outside of real estate, credit conditions are, if anything, me just give credit flows to nonfinancial businesses have remained strong.'  According to the latest QS Assessment of occurred across all major categories of loans captured in the survey, with the notable exception of residential real estate loans.'  Indexes uniformly show that increase in stress from April to June, and then a generally modest reduction in stress, particularly the Chicago and St. Louis

I mentioned earlier, the junk bond spread has declined, depending on which you use, and I monitor two measures.  It is certainly under 4 percent according to one and it is barely above 2 percent according to the other, which is the Merrill Lynch U.S. Cash Pay Index less Moody's Seasoned Aaa Corporate Bond Yield.  And as far as you look at our major trading partners, we're pretty we have highly that financial conditions have tightened.  They have tightened Stock prices have increased over the past several FOMC meetings and since the July meeting.  As measure measure, High-Yield the dollar exchange rate is concerned, if much even over the last several months.  So I would dispute the notion that restrictive financial conditions or

Almost all construction workers shop at The maintenance rate for their microwaves is important because that's where people has ramped up to a rate of repair that's 17 percent this annum, year.  So there are some counterindicators in terms of lumber There are two oddball statistics that I like to monitor with regard to housing:  One is lumber shipments, and they have slowed to a and the second would be my all-time favorite indicator, which is the repair the microwave ovens that 7-Eleven operates.  They average purchaser there 7-Eleven. take their food to warm it up.  It above 11 to 12 percent last shipments and the maintenance rate of microwave ovens, and the fact is there are certain areas that are still booming, though clearly the bloom is off the rose, and we do see financial tightening in the residential sector.

certainly the case that longer-term interest rates have increased substantially over the growth outlook, it's not that the rise in longer-term rates reflects expectations of higher or greater uncertainty about the future path of short-term interest rates, the post-liftoff conduct of policy.  Failure to scale back asset purchases at this point, as far I'm concerned, based on what I hear from the business sector and what I believe and will even greater uncertainty about future policy.  The most important It's May to August period.  Now, to the extent that this reflects a stronger necessarily bad.  To the extent short-term interest rates as argued by the Board staff, the appropriate remedy seems to me to be clear communication about as argue tomorrow, would create thing to me is post-liftoff guidance, and I'll expand on that tomorrow during my comments.

I was able to get MR. FISHER:  I've actually drilled in on it with the CEO.  [Laughter] 10,200 stores out of the 50,000 stores worldwide, and they're actually measuring this.  It's an interesting indicator because it's great for cocktail conversation.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You know who would have loved that story?  Alan Greenspan.

MR. FISHER.  In fact, he told me that story.  [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Stein.

boy, I figured I would play it straight this entirely.  I'm going to talk repetitive of things other people have said. MR. STEIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Well, time and not try to talk about policy, not try to change the subject about the outlook, and I'm going to be highly from the at the end of this year, going down to 6.5, and then 6.0.  I each of the next two years.  So, in other words, like President Lacker and a number of beginning to capitulate a little bit on my estimate of productivity growth in the face continue to see-in particular, this ongoing tension between the data on those on output growth.  The last 12 months are a very good example.  If you knew about the last 12 months was that the unemployment rate had come down First of all, in my SEP forecast, my outlook for unemployment is little changed June meeting.  I have it at 7.2 percent have cut back my projections for GDP growth considerably.  I've taken about ½ percentage point off for others, I'm of the evidence that we the labor market versus the only fact

September 17-18, 2013

good 12 months.  On the other hand, if you knew was that GDP growth was, I think, 1.7 percent over the last 12 months, by 0.8 percentage point, you'd say, well, this is a pretty the only fact you'd say that's pretty lame.

thing, measurement error, which also may well be kind of important-the growth.  You know, the economy has added a lot that just hasn't resulted in a lot more output. And so the economy is stuck in the mud.  The obvious reconciliation-modulo the Jeremy Nalewaik obvious other reconciliation is productivity more labor, but

I said, I'm beginning to revise down my estimate, but the thing I thought about is that the point estimate.  Really what shapes how you think about this is your priors are.  I realized I was going into this with a relatively fixed set of priors, going to happen if I just say to myself, 'I really have very little clue about I think about it? As it's not really so much about how diffuse and I thought, what's this whole productivity thing.'  How will that shape how year.  Unemployment just keeps coming down 0.8 percentage point a at 1½, 2, 2¼ percent, something like that.  It are two ways you could interpret this.  If you have pretty tight priors around growth is, you say, 'Wow, that's pretty bad news for the labor market given, and going to have to true-up to one another.  So, future you're just really highly and uncertain about productivity, you say, 'Well, the labor market is doing pretty well, guess I learned more.  I had uncertainty.  I've learned more, and I have to just revise down Imagine the following thought experiment:  Suppose the next six months are a run, just like we've had so far this year, and GDP just continues to muddle along seems like there what productivity outlook.'  That is to say, well, unemployment has come down, but productivity is a eventually these two things are unemployment is not going to come down as fast-it's sort of the euphemism everybody says'it wasn't supported by strong GDP growth.'  On the other hand, if agnostic and I

September 17-18, 2013

guess I'm philosophically moving in the direction of the second another, but I view that I really don't have a clue. my productivity estimate.'  So I way of looking at it.  I don't have a strong view on productivity one way or certainly have a stronger that it shapes your perspective quite a bit.  When I listen to you're saying, 'Look.  We're seeing unemployment come down, but it's in this idea that the two ought to go I think if you have the alternative view, it might be a little bit of a going to get all the really going to feel all that good in terms of having growth.  So I just want to put that out there, not that that's the leading case, but it that one would want to think about, again, in terms of how the labor market outlook. One implication of this is Vice Chairman Dudley and President Rosengren, you implicitly have much tighter priors.  In other words, because not supported.  We don't see momentum.  We don't see the kind of breakout momentum growth that we're looking for,' that implicitly maps into together in a certain way. mistake to have an output milestone.  You know, it may well be that we're way back to full employment, and it's never really fast seems like it's a plausible scenario one sets milestones for

have already talked about financial market conditions.  I We've clearly had an increase in interest rates.  David, I thought your thing It does you frame it and what horizon you look at.  If you look at the period really a low point, and in some absolute sense, rates really quite low.  When you frame it over a yearly horizon relative to a forecast, which is about it, then there's a less impressive change, and I'm not sure quite the right way of framing it is-it depends on the question you're asking. In terms of risks, many people agree that seems like the big risk.  We've clearly had a tightening of financial markets-I mean, let me be careful: was really interesting.  I thought, 'Well, we've had this big increase in interest rates.' depend a little bit on how since May, it's very big.  Now, May was were another way of thinking what

September 17-18, 2013

as given, then there's the question of, 'What is it going to do?' I would just basically repeat what Richard said.  My expectation is that there could be a and housing-related stuff.  Less so in other areas because well.  So, for example, you think about corporate investment, you think about the fact that the base rate has gone up, credit spreads, other measures of corporate credit conditions, the SLOOS, all that and a bunch of others have I think the base Treasury rate matters as much for economy is good, and so it's kind of hard to find the effect, gut instinct is that all else equal, I would have been much more worried had we seen this accompanied by a significant widening of credit spreads. But taking the increase and here potentially significant effect on housing of the configuration of other asset prices-President Williams said this as if but corporate kind of stuff, hasn't moved.  We have quite a bit of good evidence that corporate investment responds to things like the credit spread.  Egon Zakrajsek on our staff done pretty convincing work that credit spreads and things like credit spreads matter.  But you would be harder pressed to find evidence that corporate investment.  Some of that is just an econometric problem because there's an endogeneity.  When rates are up, the but my rise in Treasury rates from rising rates, but as we start evaluating the incoming data, I think you want you want to look say, if we see housing start to really tail off relative to other stuff, I effect of financial market we just see a general slowing or if we see corporate investment being a little a little more hesitant to say, 'Oh, that must be coming from financial less apparent.  I think we want to be a little bit I think that's just worth bearing in mind, and I don't say this so much to downplay the risk that we have to have a bit of a hypothesis with which you evaluate it, and a sense of where for problems.  That is to would be inclined to infer that that's telling us something about the conditions.  If disappointing, I'd be conditions,' because the channel is just a little bit careful about not overattributing all disappointments to the change in financial conditions

September 17-18, 2013

are disappointments for lots of other reasons.  Thank you, Mr.

because, of course, there Chairman.

I would say is two things.  One, I think we have to be pretty uncertain about growth partly because of what happened early in the cycle.  Productivity growth to interpret this low period.  Is this something growth we saw during the the early stages of the recovery? What productivity was unusually high.  So it's a little hard to say how that's temporary, or just the flip side of the very high productivity downturn and we've seen the gotten very excited about that, and we think the liftoff going to generate stronger income, and that's going to support aggregate demand-and then we've seen this disappointment.  It's this chronic the response to these seeming accelerations in payroll growth where me feel a little bit more reluctant to buy into do. And, two, we've had these other episodes during this expansion when employment numbers pick up, and we've is at hand because employment is higher disappointment in terms of you haven't seen the follow-through that makes employment growth to the degree that maybe you

Let me say that I don't intend it as I spring.  We had strong PCE growth, fast-rising housing prices.  Consumer As Dan points out, household delevering is ongoing, and all of that strong fiscal winds that were meant to be waning in the latter half of the year.

PCE has been of fiscal tightening are much less clear now.  Consumer So again, I don't mean it to be a terribly pessimistic outcome.

The path and effect confidence has fallen back.  Housing prices are increasing, but at a slower and perhaps more sustainable rate. back to expecting table and, frankly, like the Tealbook.

Let me first say that I thought the alternative simulation in the least four or five of us have mentioned that.  I that there are the three narratives that he that GDP may be being misleadingly reported and will be revised up later, financial crisis.  And maybe the explanation lies in some or all case, what we're seeing is a stronger reduction in unemployment than we would I predict And with that lower slower than in the baseline, to 6.2 percent by the end of 2015, which is still a faster pace than the weak GDP Tealbook was very interesting on this.  I'm not the only one who was very taken by Jeremy Nalewaik's interesting briefing on Monday-at won't go into that in great depth now.  I'll just say mentioned, which are that we may be seeing supply-side damage, or that this might be just more catch-up from the period of excess firing during the of those.  In any expect to see, and there's just no way to know how much longer that will continue-so that it will.

September 17-18, 2013

I heard from the pretty large group I spoke to before this meeting, including CEOs of banks of all sizes whom I Duke, and also private equity and hedge fund investors, business can detect of a sharp improvement. And that overall slow improvement narrative is what of people that inherited from Governor executives, and a bunch of others.  There's this feeling that we will see slowly improving conditions, but really no expectation I

also think, and others seem to agree, that the tail risks have probably diminished and are public and the markets seem to think that this worried and see no way out.  The Congress has about seven days left in and mid-October to find an answer-and at least in 2011, there were talks are not even any talks.  So this is really an accident waiting to happen. I changing, but they're still there.  In particular, the fall's debt ceiling and government shutdown confrontation is just more bread and circuses to entertain the populace, and that amounts really to a huge unpriced risk.  Long-time participants in these matters are very session between now going on.  Now there the July meeting, I suggested that we were now in 'execution after the articulation of a loose tapering-and-stopping rule, and that phrase has a flavor of technocratic precision, which turns out to have been aspirational or perhaps Nonetheless, this is still an exercise in being faithful to what the gains in the labor markets, moderate growth that picks up over the next going to Let me then turn to current conditions, and the question for this meeting, it seems to me, is how those conditions measure up against the framework for reducing purchases that we agreed upon at the June meeting.  At mode' comforting misleading.  [Laughter] Chairman laid out in the June press conference, which was that for the Committee to taper, incoming data needed to be broadly consistent with the Committee's June expectation of three things:  continuing several quarters, and inflation heading back toward the 2 percent objective.  So I'm

September 17-18, 2013

an attempt to simplify some pretty touch on each of them quickly.  And this is admittedly complicated underlying issues.

gains in the labor markets, the trailing three-month payroll average is are slightly up.  In addition, the cumulative improvement in conditions is significant.  We're down 0.8 percentage point since the announcement gap between last September's unemployment forecast and this full percentage point starting in 2014.  So with all of that, it's hard for me conditions are not broadly consistent with June expectations. As for continuing now 148,000, and the August number was 169,000.  The expectation in the June Tealbook was 160,000 per month for the third quarter.  Unemployment has declined more than in the June forecast, although no one likes to see the decline in participation.  The staff's index of labor market indicators and several others labor market of the program, and the September's is now a to conclude that labor on growth picking up is complicated, it seems to me.

As far as readings of Q2 were probably an anomaly.  I inflation data are broadly consistent with the forecast.  So I would say consistent and have been met. The story to call for rate than was expected in June, but given all of the near-term uncertainty the link between GDP and unemployment, this part of the test is one where careful, and it probably has the least clear connection to the And it's also worth pointing out here that there are large standard errors of both payrolls and GDP, which should probably steer us to smooth through bad months and good months as well, and look at the longer-term data inflation is concerned, readings since June, to me, suggest that inflation has stabilized below our mandate-consistent rate, and that the very low would say that incoming all three conditions are broadly

So the medium- and longer-term story for the housing a gradual loosening in previous Tealbook anyone who doesn't have pristine credit, and that's a concern that's just not related to asset purchases.

The first is the tightening in financial conditions, and overall, I continue to think that financial conditions are in a better, more sustainable place. could hurt the recovery is clearly housing, and the view for now seems to be that the housing Housing is still affordable by our measures.  Rates are still historically low. formation can only recovery is intact.  As Richard pointed out, we don't see tighter financial conditions for investment-grade or non-investment-grade borrowers.  We continue to see bank lending standards.  We see the equity market up or at least flat since the and, I think, up since June.  So the real issue with financial conditions is that banks don't seem to want to bank with directly round of tightening, and I think that are high enough that any reaction would be modest.  Of course, none of will ever be sure of that at this meeting or at any future meeting. I do understand the desire not to provoke another expectations of a taper us

The suspect it will be no less real in future meetings.

September 17-18, 2013

ground in leaning toward is unreasonable.  And, Mr. I will stop there, lest I inadvertently cross over into policy matters.  [Laughter] The bottom line for me is that the Committee, I think, would be on firm concluding that the test set forth in June has been met.  I don't argue that the data compel that conclusion or that the alternative we are obviously Chairman,

It feels a little harder to summarize this time than at our previous CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I wouldn't want that to happen.  Thank you all very much. Let me try to summarize. meeting for some reason.

contours of the outlook haven't changed too much overall since our July growth is expected to continue.  Some, but far from all, expect a who expect a pickup has been slowly atrophying over guess Einstein's principle does apply after a while.  But there still are, as we can see in going to be at least some pickup as the fiscal drag and are downside risks still from fiscal policy uncertainties, interest in the data. Generally, the meeting.  Modest to moderate pickup, and I think the number of people time.  I the SEP, many people who think there's other headwinds wane.  There rates, and from uncertainties about productivity that Governor Stein talked about.  Participants continue to see 'persistent ambiguity'

There are very few impulse buys, and In the household sector, consumer spending has been a little bit on the soft side.  Retail sales, soft.  Factors that year, employment insecurity, and declining consumers are more value driven.

growth recently has been somewhat pretty stagnant.  Unemployment continues to falling participation and low productivity.  However, labor market The recent labor data have been mixed.  Payroll disappointing, and the employment-to-population ratio-at least for the entire population, as opposed to the working-age population-has been fall in part because of

September 17-18, 2013

why the labor market has been growth as a possible alternative.  Judging the amount of slack and structural damage, indicator that would that there's structural damage is the fact that fewer long-term unemployed are finding changes is conditions have improved meaningfully since September 2012, and participation could rise with the recovery.  One explanation a number of people suggested for improving over the past year was the possibility of mismeasurement of GDP growth, and they cited GDI however, remains quite difficult.  Governor Tarullo talked about that.  One suggest jobs.  More are leaving the labor force.  On the other hand, the distribution of wage not showing skew.

housing continued to be strong. In the housing sector, there are some fundamentals continuing to promote expansion, but higher mortgage rates are a meaningful risk in that sector.  Auto sales, which are more dependent on short-term rates, have

I have in my I have here 'then there's ISM surveys have been encouraging, as has the NFIB survey; firms say that the amount of demand does not justify much hiring at from the surveys.

In the financial sector, there was a lot of discussion of the increase in interest rates-how much of it was in some sense justified, and whether or not Certainly One offsetting factor is higher house prices and stock prices, which will mute the effects of higher interest rates to some extent.  A stronger dollar works in the other direction.  Household balance sheets and firm balance sheets are continuing to improve, which is terms, as opposed to a higher rates.  It was noted that policy return to full employment so long as monetary policy is appropriate.

However, the low r *, importantly, does not prevent a

A few participants argued that optimal policy maintenance of following through on commitments. Inflation remains low but is expected to rise gradually toward target.  However, inflation has been below some of the recent softness in inflation has reversed, as anticipated, and that's true according to a variety of measures.  Businesses in most, but not all, Districts report few wage or price pressures. I should involve an inflation overshoot, but another participant emphasized that credibility requires raised, such as what the long-term policy are, whether financial conditions had tightened, whether there's structural damage, the sources of unemployment declines are, and so on, but I think there is some diversity of So a number of interesting topics were implications what

wonder if I could ask a question of Governor Stein.  In trying to think you laid out, I was trying to think of some of I should be paying attention to.  What are the inflation implications if that correct?  I would think that unit labor costs would be going down if that's coming MR. EVANS.  I through the stronger productivity hypothesis that the other markers that hypothesis is about.

I'm getting in over my head-but it I think if productivity is weak, so GDP is growing slowly, would be the right summary statistic.  Did I MR. STEIN.  David, you'll step in and help me if may happen very quickly.  [Laughter] but we're taking up slack, inflation will come when the slack is taken up, in some sense.  In a very simple limiting case, the unemployment rate pass?

MR. EVANS.  Okay.

We are going to have Steve Meyer give the will be a very interesting discussion tomorrow. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay. introduction in a moment.  But before we do that, let me just take a few moments to try to set up what I'm sure you want to call it, of assets.  I a discussion we had at the previous meeting.  But if anyone has a different view, good time to mention that.  So that would be one option; the other option about is to take no action at this meeting, but to use the statement to indicate As a lot of people have already anticipated, we have two plausible policy options that we can discuss tomorrow.  One is a so-called small taper, mini-taper, whatever about $10 billion or so.  By the way, I have been assuming that when we do come to this point of reducing purchases, it will be more or less proportional between different categories of got that from tomorrow would be a we will be talking

September 17-18, 2013

conditionality described in June is met.  I note that either will come back to that the Committee is still on track with the broad strategy articulated in June, as long as the recovery continues, and as long as the of these options could be combined with tweaks to forward guidance, and I that in just a minute.

a lot of consultation, and I have concluded that the Committee is nicely split on the I have indicated a little bit about I'm leaning, but let me just say a few words on the two sides of the issue.  In terms of going ahead with a small reduction in purchases, I think President Plosser was talked about this.  We gone through a lot of effort here to set up the situation that we are in now, where by most good reasons not to do it, but if we don't do it, I think there will be a little bit of and we will have to see what the implications will be for contemplated here, at least as I understand abandonment of the June framework.  Rather, within that framework, there was 'later this year,' we didn't say 'September.'  We said 'depending on the I understand it, the no-action plan doesn't involve abandoning the Now, I want to just say first that neither of these options is an unreasonable option, and I have done issue.  [Laughter]  There is an awful lot of fence-sitting as well. which way the advantages of the first to mention the communications implications.  Governor Stein has have estimates about 65 percent of market participants anticipate a small reduction in purchases. There may be confusion, a little bit of volatility, communication.  That being said, I think what's being it, is not an discretion-we said data.'  So I think, as framework, and I'll come back to that.

that our original criterion was year ago when R&amp;S and the SEP were forecasting unemployment now of were concerned, naturally, about what we Now, a second point to make in favor of action is substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.  And I would remind you of the conversations we had a about 7.8 percent, or something like that, and we

September 17-18, 2013

got no progress in labor markets.  And I think, while certainly labor markets are absolute sense, it is very reasonable to argue that there has been improvement. you look at other unemployment measures-the marginally attached workers or involuntary part-time workers, et down as much or more as the standard unemployment measure.  I won't we know they've been reasonably strong over the year.  They have been want to come back to that. would do if we still weak in any Many people have noted that the unemployment rate has come down eight-tenths.  The participation rate is down three-tenths, which is more or less trend.  So, arguably, a very large part of that eight-tenths is related to jobs.  If broader ones, including cetera-they have come cite the payroll data, but weaker recently, and I

couple of indicators that I would mention in rationalizing that there has is aggregate hours.  A couple of years ago, I talked about the fact of hours, it was much worse.  And we are seeing some improvement there.  We are of job availability. There are another been some improvement; one that in terms of hours, the recession was worse than it was in terms of unemployment.  In unemployment terms, this recession was about the same as the 1981-82 recession at its depth, but in terms also seeing some improvement in various sentiment-type indicators worth noting that this an awful lot of fiscal restraint.  Again, ex ante, the going to be 1 to 1½ percentage points worth of fiscal restraint, and have a very substantial impact on the labor market.  To the extent that job past year have been comparable to the previous year, given the fiscal restraint, is a bit I think we have communications come to the point where we do want to reduce our purchases. So there has been some improvement, and I think it's probably improvement has occurred despite what was CBO was saying that this was that that was going to gains this of an accomplishment.  So we haven't reached substantial improvement, but made meaningful improvement, and that is good news.  That will make our easier when we

September 17-18, 2013

counterargument?  What about the argument for not taking action goal we want to do at going to do it.  It's not that we're necessarily being deceitful, conditions consistent with meeting our a wide variety of interest rates, the dollar, et cetera, I come to the conclusion also the speed of the rise is such that we cannot yet be and financial conditions.  And of the argument is that there has been some tightening, but even though is uncertain, one thing we don't know for sure is whether the economy going to be something that is going to damage going forward. Now, what about the tomorrow?  I think that we run a little bit of a risk of becoming too narrowly focused on the of winding down the asset purchase program.  That's obviously something some point.  We have said we were but the bigger question, of course, is, are financial objectives?  I recognize that we can debate how tight financial conditions are.  If I look at what has happened to that not only the magnitude of the rise but sure that the economy has absorbed this change in interest rates so, I think a central part the amount of tightening can continue to move forward or whether this is the recovery for delaying the reduction in at this meeting, as someone mentioned, is the signaling effect.  We would be saying on reducing the asset purchase program no matter what, that we are attention to the data, we are data-dependent, we are responding to what we are seeing in a very important signal to send.  But since we want to be clear, at least as I radical shift in the policy approach.  Consequently, I don't think there is going to we defer tightening.  Nevertheless, I think there made for signaling that we are indeed committed to provide sufficiently Now, if we stay within the framework-which is what everyone is advocating, I thinkone might argue that that limits what we can do.  One argument purchases that we are not hell-bent paying the economy.  That's understand it, that we are staying within the framework that we set up, I don't think we are talking about a be a major easing of financial conditions, even if is some argument to be

September 17-18, 2013

I will argue in a minute that as we go have some other alternatives that are not as useful at the moment. accommodative conditions to achieve our objectives. forward in time, we may reduced, to some extent, what I perceive to be the costs.  In addition, we will at a lower price, so the fiscal risks are lower.  If we improve the ability to I have two other observations about the no-taper option.  One is that the costs of the asset purchase program have moderated now that the increase in interest rates and the unwinding of risky positions have now be buying bonds control short-term interest rates through the repo facility, the exit risks are lower.  My overall sense is that the risks to the balance sheet have declined somewhat, which is a consideration.

announce tomorrow that we are reducing asset will be read everywhere as the first step in a tightening measure.  If we were to data got worse, then we would not really be much better off because we a better outlook.  So have essentially communicated that you are tightening policy exactly at the time when get worse.  So avoiding regret in a situation of high uncertainty, I think, The other consideration is one that Governor Powell raised, which is regret minimization. Whether we think of it this way or not, if we purchases, that taper tomorrow, and the would have to delay further reductions until we saw more indications of there is not that much gain in that case from having moved.  Then you are in a situation where you conditions subsequently suggests that we should be patient.

would mention two factors.  One is a good sense yet of what the impact of the higher interest rates is going to be. worth mentioning is one that a number of people have noted, which is Why is this uncertainty higher now than normal?  I just the nature of the recent data, which have been quite mixed, and in particular the fact that we do not really have And the second factor fiscal developments in the next month or so.  So, again, there is a risk here that we would act and

September 17-18, 2013

then we would find ourselves very unhappy that we had acted in advance of all of these bad developments.

yet a third approach, which is to strengthen the forward guidance, and I appealing.  There are a number of things we could do.  We could add that says we won't raise rates if inflation doesn't meet guidance about what happens after unemployment hits I want to throw my support behind what Governor Yellen and Governor Tarullo and about, in terms of the importance of communicating in some way why the rule guidance. Now, there is personally find that pretty an inflation floor to the forward guidance some condition.  We can provide more 6½ percent. others were talking policy rate seems likely to stay low for a very long time, inconsistent with standard Taylor estimates.  So there are a number of things that we can do in terms of and in terms of actual direct effects on financial just say this very definitively-we could even guidance would be to actually peg rates over a period of are a we could do.  One issue, though, is that given where we are in terms of the on the long-term At some point, I think that would be helpful and could perhaps substitute for some of the asset purchases, both in terms of signaling conditions.  We could even consider-and let me consider more aggressive or creative measures when we came to that point.  For example, one way to very strongly underscore rate time, which we could do by buying and selling securities longer than overnight.  So there number of things uncertainties about the leadership transition, about membership of the FOMC, and those things, I think that this meeting is probably the worst possible meeting to rely heavily credibility of the Committee.  As we move forward in time, my sense is that we will have more opportunity to use various kinds of communication and commitment to either substitute or complement asset purchases.

September 17-18, 2013

are arguments on both sides of this.  But, broadly speaking, we do we need to think not only about the winding down of this program, which we all also about what is the best thing, more the Congress has set for us.  And that will be an not only about tomorrow's decision but also try to give some input and guidance to how we should think about this going forward.  Monetary policy is a dynamic process.  It is well as tomorrow's action. So, in summary, I think there whatever want to do within a reasonable period of time, but broadly, in terms of achieving the objectives that interesting debate that we have tomorrow.  As usual, in our conversation tomorrow, I hope people will talk as not a meeting-by-meeting process.  So I think it would be, again, helpful for everybody to try to think about the next few meetings as ask Steve Meyer to give us a brief introduction to the Before we end today, let me alternatives.

FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.' MR. MEYER. 7   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will be referring to the handout labeled 'Material for play in the SEP and your sense of the outlook.  So I'm going your current SEP projections as indicating, as Governor as being on as the baseline scenario that the Chairman laid out in recent The Chairman just nicely summarized the key questions that the outside world has been asking about this meeting, and Governor Powell did a very nice job of summarizing the state of to skip ahead to the middle of the page, except to note that market participants are quite likely to interpret Powell suggested, that Committee participants still see the economy basically the same track months.  So that will lead them naturally to the question, will the FOMC cut the pace of purchases?

across these surveys, think more likely to wait until October or December.  However, at this meeting.  As shown in the middle right panel, 8 of the 21 dealers 70 percent or more, but 8 others saw the likelihood of a cut greater than 50 percent, while 5 assigned much As indicated by the middle panel in the center row, surveys of market participants indicate that nearly 75 percent of respondents, averaging you are most likely to reduce the pace of purchases at this meeting, and about 20 percent think you are only one of these surveys-the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers-gives us any information about the probabilities respondents attach to a cut in the pace of purchases assigned a probability of at this meeting as only modestly lower probabilities.  Put another way, about half of the dealers who think you are

you do, someone will be surprised. more likely to cut the pace of purchases this month than not are far from sure.  So no matter what you indicated that you continue to see as likely to be appropriate in 2015, as shown in the bottom left market participants may not, as some you discussed.  Perhaps more interesting, and as raised by Governor Yellen's you see the unemployment rate and inflation as close to estimates of their longer-run normal levels by late 2016, almost all of you see be skeptical that the Committee rate below 4 percent if the economy is, in fact, close to full for that projection. Turning to interest-rate policy, almost all of funds rate liftoff figure.  The dealers who responded to the New York survey continue to share the view that liftoff is most likely in 2015, but other of discussion, though most of your the federal funds rate remaining below its longer-run level at that time.  Some recent market commentary indicates that investors may would keep the funds employment with inflation near 2 percent by the end of 2016, suggesting that they will be seeking to understand your rationale

you are concerned that market participants are misreading your interest rate you are concerned that they anticipate a more your forward rate guidance.  The bottom right panel suggests four If reaction function, and in particular, if rapid increase in the federal funds rate than you think likely, you may be interested in altering possibilities for such changes; I'll say a bit more about them a little later.

alternatives, and first to alternative B, on pages 6 and 7, the first economic activity has been expanding at a 'moderate' pace. conditions have shown if you prefer-in recent months, but that growth.  It concludes by been running below the Committee's 2 percent objective, from fluctuations due to changes in energy prices.'  So overall, this is a B contains one significant change Turning to the paragraph indicates that It also notes that some indicators of labor market 'improvement'-or 'further improvement' the unemployment rate remains elevated.  The paragraph also notes that mortgage rates have risen further and that fiscal policy is restraining saying that inflation has 'apart reading that seems consistent with your earlier projections, but nuanced in terms of mixed data.  The second paragraph of alternative from the July statement:  it cites the tightening of financial conditions in recent months as a potential risk to the pace of improvement in the economy and labor market.

effects of growing underlying strength in the broader It then states that the Committee The third paragraph begins by noting that, in light of the restraining fiscal policy, the improvements in economic activity and in the labor market since the asset purchase program began suggest economy.  This is a point that the Chairman made. decided to wait for more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting asset purchases.  The decision to wait could reflect, at least in part, the concern that tighter financial conditions might slow the pace of improvement in the economy and labor market.

from the version distributed The blue text in the fourth paragraph reflects changes to the Committee on Sunday night.  This paragraph now emphasizes that, in judging

to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the Committee will be looking to see conditions and inflation moving back toward 2 percent.  The reference year is still on the table, but that the decision asset are not on a preset course and will depend on the economic outlook as well your assessments of the likely efficacy and costs of continued purchases. when whether incoming information supports the expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market to coming meetings, should you choose to include it, is meant to signal that a reduction in the pace of purchases this will depend on the incoming data.  The paragraph concludes by stating that purchases as

I noted, offers the option of adding forward guidance equilibrium value even after the economy reaches maximum employment Yellen laid out.  Such of the The fifth paragraph, as indicating that the Committee expects that the federal funds rate will remain below its long-run and inflation returns to 2 percent, for the reasons that Governor guidance could help explain to the outside world the persistently low level federal funds rate in your economic projections.

I indicated earlier, market expectations for this meeting appear fairly diffuse, reaction to various outcomes.  If market to reduce the pace of purchases and sees itself as rising, and the dollar As making it difficult to gauge the likely participants read a statement like that for alternative B as indicating that the Committee is close to a decision most likely still on the path laid out in June, then the adjustment in asset prices and exchange rates might well be muted.  But if market participants read the statement as signaling that the Committee is no longer on that path, then the adjustment in yields and prices would be sharper, with yields falling, equity prices likely depreciating.

you judge that the improvement in the economy and in the outlook since last you confident that progress will continue, you might well prefer more current economic conditions, while the second paragraph says the more confident that the labor market will continue to improve first says that when purchases are completed.  The fifth paragraph simply forward guidance from July. If September warrants an immediate reduction in the pace of asset purchases, and if have become more alternative C, on pages 8 and 9.  The first paragraph of alternative C takes a upbeat view of Committee has become and that inflation will move back toward its longer-run goal.  The third paragraph announces a modest reduction of $5 billion each in the pace of Treasury and agency MBS purchases.  Alternative C offers two versions of paragraph 4:  The continued progress toward the Committee's employment and inflation goals likely would result in additional measured reductions in the pace of asset purchases; the second adds language noting the Committee's expectation that the unemployment rate will be around 7 percent repeats the meeting.  But the strongly positive at A modest cut in the pace of purchases seems close to most market participants' view of the most likely outcome from this FOMC characterization of current conditions and the outlook in alternative C would come as something of a surprise, potentially prompting some rise in yields.  Moreover, a sizable fraction of market participants appears to see a cut in the pace of purchases

Those years ahead were projected to be an inflation floormonetary policy decisions after the unemployment threshold I don't envision that you would adopt all of those, but you rate in 2016 that also appears, in the end of alternative B. Turning finally to alternative A, on pages 4 and 5, the first two paragraphs are essentially the same as in alternative appear to have slowed in recent months.  The third paragraph states that the Committee has not market or sufficient progress toward its economic objectives to warrant a reduction in the pace of purchases.  The fourth paragraph holds open the prospect for a reduction in the pace of purchases but might occur.  The fifth paragraph then offers forward guidance, which we've include a reduction in the unemployment rate threshold to 6 percent, a sentence indicating that the Committee 'anticipates that it would not raise its target for the federal funds rate if inflation between one and two below 1¾ percent'-something that we might think of loosely as and new language that provides more information about the factors the Committee will consider in making is crossed.  I should add might want to debate whether any of them are desirable.  The paragraph concludes with the additional guidance about the funds brackets, at alternative A if you judge that it would be inappropriate to asset purchases while actual inflation is below 2 percent and you see the unemployment rate years.  In you may think it appropriate to modify the Committee's rate guidance as You might prefer reduce the pace of projected inflation also remains below 2 percent, or if as likely to be well above its longer-run normal rate for another couple of either case, well as to continue the current pace of purchases.

They would conclude that the Committee no longer anticipates a reduction in the year, and thus would revise up their expectations Interest rates likely would might depreciate.  But equity prices could fall if market A as indicating that the Committee has A decision to adopt a statement along the lines of changes in the forward guidance, would surprise probably pace of purchases by the end of the of the total size of the Committee's asset purchases. decline, though expected inflation might well rise, equity prices probably would increase, and the dollar participants read the statement of alternative become more pessimistic about the outlook.

goCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good morning, everybody.  We are ready for our policy round, and I have President Rosengren first.

Since people's comments went long yesterday, I bequeath it to the Chair.  I do find that the curved part, which I don't get a lot of use out of, might be more useful to current alternative B.  I'd like to have tied the purchase program to economic outcomes, conditions.  If our purchase program is to be data driven, it needs to reference a growth and more rapid expansion in employment than we are currently I support but there does not seem to be much support on the Committee for moving in that direction, in part because the unemployment rate at this time may not provide a broad enough reflection of labor market broader set of data so that we can have reasonable confidence that the economy will return to 2 percent inflation and full employment in a two- to three-year time frame.  Such a path would require more economic experiencing.

Further tightening of long-term in the economy, those interest-sensitive sectors our policies.  Even though the unemployment rate is much lower than a from potential workers exiting the labor force and thus does I would like to see. Over the past several months, financial conditions have become would have liked, given the current pace of the action that might further element of our mandate too far into the future for rates risks further slowing the only strong sectors that have benefited from year ago, much of that decline came not provide as strong a signal of labor market improvement as

I fear that as a nonevent that is already priced into markets.  But that view risks magnified small and forthright guidance or any other signal we can employ that avoids the perception that we are I see little cost to waiting until we experience stronger GDP before beginning program.  While the direction of rates when we have no confidence in my some see tapering underestimating the potential market reaction, which in recent months has changes in tone into an expectation of a much more rapid tightening than we hope to suggest. When we do choose to reduce purchases, we should be careful to use clear forward sharply tightening policy.  Such communication will be critical to minimizing the risk that markets will overreact to our reductions in purchases.

appropriate, Treasuries than from MBS.  And in terms of the language, while fully support the intent of the last sentence in paragraph 5, I do think that, as the discussion concept.  It might best be left to the minutes, the I fully support the intent of the sentence, I do It may be difficult for people to interpret without a little Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In terms of the distribution of our purchases, I prefer that, when it becomes we reduce purchases more from I yesterday highlighted, it's a pretty complicated press conference, and future speeches to fully explain what the sense of that sentence is before we actually put it in the statement.  Again, while worry about just putting it out there. more guidance.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Williams.

you said yesterday, there are good envisioned in alternative C.  I view the choice I do see several advantages to a very modest step-down in the pace of asset MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As arguments for both alternative B and the tapering as a close call.

September 17-18, 2013

year.  To my mind, there's no question that we have Chairman laid out in as anticipated back in June, which argues for execution on the plan laid purchases, as in alternative C, at this time.  First, it would appropriately acknowledge the sizable improvement in labor markets over the past made considerable progress toward this goal since the program was started.  Second, we'd demonstrate concretely that we are following through on the plan that the his June press conference, and that the Committee endorsed in July.  Overall, the recovery is proceeding more or less out then.  Third, with a small initial move, we would still be adding considerable monetary stimulus going forward, which would position us well in case future improvements in the labor market fall short of our expectations.

I see the main argument for alternative B as wanting to collect further information expansion.  And of course at one level, it's hard to communications.  Here I would have a slightly different June plan, including about Now, and confidence in the ongoing strength of the argue against gaining information and certainty.  However, inaction carries with it considerable risks, especially regarding our perspective on what it means in terms of what our baseline should be.  The the knockouts and the whole plan as described, should really be our baseline for thinking what inaction versus action is.

future policy could increase if we were perceived as backtracking on are not at all evident.  And this confusion could commitment to our forward guidance more year.  The point I want to make here is, the strategy is what matters, not the Uncertainty about the plan laid out in June for reasons that undermine the public's understanding of our generally, including forward guidance with the funds rate.  Indeed, in my mind, clear confirmation of our plan is more important than whether we decide to reduce purchases at this meeting or later this

September 17-18, 2013

which meeting we make what move and exactly how much we adjust the tactical decisions about purchases.

am worried that delaying action may well financial conditions. B, I think it's critically important that clear that this is not a repudiation of the plan that we have articulated over the past few as helpful in this regard.  I'm thinking of the first sentence of paragraph 3.  I would also that we put in the bracketed phrase in paragraph 4.  I actually like 'later this year,' but 'at good, too.  So I strongly urge that we have that bracketed language in signal a newfound pessimism about the by the forecast.  Such a public misperception Even with our best communication efforts, I confuse markets, add to uncertainty and risk premiums, and, in the end, could be counterproductive with respect to the desire to bring about more-favorable Therefore, if the Committee chooses to go with alternative we make months.  I view the new language in paragraph 3 of alternative B that was introduced over the weekend argue its coming meetings' is paragraph 4.  Moreover, we must not inadvertently outlook that's supported neither by the data nor could be damaging to confidence.

years has climbed considerably, which has pushed up term premiums more In my view, the proper treatment for this problem, which I do view as a problem, is funds rate, not more asset purchases.  Therefore, it would Now, I am concerned about the apparent tightening in expectations regarding the funds rate that we've seen over the past few months.  In addition, it's clear that uncertainty about rates over the next few generally. stronger forward guidance around our

and push against the tapering of asset purchases, now or in the future, implies a more imminent liftoff what we will do once the unemployment in the language that says 'Once the unemployment rate reaches 6 I would replace '6 percent' with '6½ percent':  'Once the unemployment rate Relevant factors include additional measures of labor market employment'-which, I think, captures this issue and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.'  The important is that it does create some space between the 6½ percent threshold and the be very useful, sooner rather than later, to strengthen our forward guidance perception that of the funds rate.  To that end, it would help to clarify rate reaches 6½ percent.  Now, I favor a small variant of the language in paragraph 5 of alternative A-specifically, percent . . . ,' reaches 6½ percent, and assuming inflation is well contained at that time, the Committee will consider a broad set of indicators in determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy. conditions such as the level and growth of around employment-to-population and labor force participation-'indicators of inflation pressures part of that language actual liftoff of the funds rate.

But again, agree with President Rosengren that that's best done through the minutes, through the conference, and through our more general communications.  Thank you. Finally, in terms of this issue that President Rosengren mentioned and Governor Yellen highlighted yesterday-about, once we do lift off, the next phase, what the be-I agree the right way to convey that information.  Governor Yellen is absolutely right that we need to convey that information, and we need to explain our thinking here.  The SEP is going to be out there.  We have, I think, a good story I Chairman's press

PARTICIPANTS.  There's a two-hander.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Oh, I'm sorry.  President Kocherlakota.

remarks, you favored the language in paragraph 5 of alternative A, but '6' with '6½.'  What was your thinking on that? MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  A quick question for President Williams.  In your proposed replacing

'6½' in the statement.  My view is, we won't rate until the unemployment rate is around 6 percent or something like that.  What to explain that even when it gets to 6½, what our thinking will be.  We will no at unemployment, MR. WILLIAMS.  Well, we currently have raise the funds I'm trying to do is longer have a threshold out there, so the thinking is, we'll be looking employment-

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  That's helpful.  Thanks.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  President Plosser.

I recommend that we proceed with I believe it is the wisest and most prudent course of action at this time.  There are as there always are, but my assessment of the costs and at this meeting is that the MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Today alternative C. costs and benefits with each strategy, benefits, and the potential risk, associated with not reducing purchases costs exceed the benefits.

want to align myself with many of the comments that President Williams just offered in all about signaling.  It's all about what the actions to be or not to be.  I think I supporting this.  The small taper that's being contemplated in alternative C is trivial when it comes to dollars and cents.  It's just not important.  It will have no direct impact on the growth rate or improvement in the economy.  Clearly, it's markets interpret this move to be, and what they interpret our we can agree up front that it's just not consequential from a quantity standpoint.  So it's about

September 17-18, 2013

In the first place, markets are expecting us to taper, broadly speaking.  That our choosing to taper-or 'taper lite,' whatever effects, but they're likely to be small and Should we not taper, there will be some surprises, and the market reaction could expectations. doesn't mean there won't be any price effects of you want to call it.  There probably will be some manageable. be, potentially, quite unpredictable.  I'll come back to that in a minute.

markets for this.  We've talked about a plan.  We have not pushed growing assessment that, in fact, this meeting is likely to begin a process. signaling that continued with during the intermeeting period, could be I want to do, in thinking about signaling, is to think about, as That's the way we have to think about it.  And I worry that if we don't we've prepared markets, it could have some very unexpected and I think we prepared the back on the market's We haven't pushed back on that, and so I think that not following through with the the Chairman gave in June, and that we a very costly mistake for us.  What the Chairman suggested yesterday, what implication this decision today has for the future decisions that we make. follow through with how dangerous effects on constraints we face in the future.

a preset course.  This Tapering today is consistent with our performance.  If, in fact, we do choose to taper, we should be very clear that, as the Chairman and others have said, this is not can change and be adjusted, as appropriate, to economic conditions.  I think that needs to be very clear.

by not tapering today, as President Williams said, we will send a a weak economy.  And we run the risk of undermining confidence, of undermining economy, when in fact, our expectations about the what they think our reaction I do worry, though, that signal of expectations about the future path of the future path of the economy really haven't changed that much.  By not acting today, we run the risk of creating substantial confusion in the marketplace over

September 17-18, 2013

for asset purchases.  We've laid out a plan.  Should we not follow through has helped clarify how we're changing our reaction function that I function might be with that, they're going to say, 'If not now, when?  And under what conditions?'  There's nothing that we have said that leads to this unexpected decision.  I think that's going to lead to policy uncertainty.  It will lead to volatility in markets that we don't want.  We don't want to enhance uncertainty, and yet think we will be doing just that.

I think that it raises a question in the a 7 percent unemployment rate when this purchase program might end.  Now, we have not committed to that, as I understand it.  And I think that not tapering today will signal to the markets that a lot weaker than we thought, and (b) we will not end this program the unemployment rate is 7.3 percent now.  We forecast.  And we will not It potentially undermines our credibility. marketplace about the fact that we've talked about asset our 6½ percent is a threshold.  But (a) we think the economy is by the time we get to 7 percent, because, frankly, could easily be at 7 percent by the first quarter, which is actually my be able to end it that quickly.

The odds of our taking an action at are actually pretty low.  I think we'll be in the midst of We will be, potentially, in an environment where there are hearings on Chairperson for this Committee.  Regardless of who that nominee is, the going to debate monetary policy, and it's going to be quite fractious, I suspect, to be a little bit reluctant to enter the fray with policy acting over the rest of this year is very high.  That means we are unlikely to be and then we won't start tapering, in my view, until we're close I don't think we'll be able to act the rest of this fall. either the October or December meeting the fiscal ceiling debate. the nomination of a new Congress is during those hearings.  We are likely decisions that are viewed as important in the midst of those debates.  So I don't think the likelihood of our able to act until starting next year,

September 17-18, 2013

confusing signals, and the public is not going to know to 7 percent.  Again, we'll be sending what to think about it.

as when we would consider raising the funds Taking no action today basically sends the signal that that's off the table-we will not act won't be done tapering by the time we get to 6½.  This is essentially a backdoor decision to change the threshold of I think that's the way the market will interpret it, and I am very uncomfortable with I don't like to do that through a nonaction today that, de facto, resets those We've laid out a threshold of 6½ percent rate. at 6½-because, in effect, this says we decision to not taper today 6½ percent. using a nontaper decision today to signal something about our forward guidance in the process. And that will be the effect, if not the intent, of what we're doing.  If we want to change the threshold, then we need to debate that issue and talk about it.  I'm perfectly open to having that debate.  But expectations in the marketplace.  I'm worried that that's what in fact might happen.

agree with President Williams.  My thought about future guidance is that the important argued that in.  But I decision. I thing we need to talk about is not changing the threshold, but talking about how we will act after that threshold is reached.  And we need to be more explicit about that.  Many of us position back when we set up the threshold.  That's the direction we need to be going think that by not acting today, we are actually making a decision on that de facto, and I'm uncomfortable with that today on a modest taper sends clear signals that we're not on a and that this could be stretched out longer.  By not tapering, we run the risk of So I think that not acting preset course constraining ourselves in the future by putting ourselves in a box about what our choices might be and how they might play out.  I'm uncomfortable with that.  I think we need to go with the

September 17-18, 2013

plan that the Chairman laid out and stick to it, send the signal that we're sticking to it, and proceed accordingly.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Chairman, I hope the Committee listened very carefully to President Plosser and President Williams.  I think those want to belittle my of Keynes.  Sorry, I couldn't resist that one-I thought of that

We seem to be finding excuses not to move, and I'm going to come around meetings, we expectations and the dealer surveys.  And then this time, we had all of these nuances of interpretation-sort of, 'Well, I'm not sure really what they mean,' and '48 and so on. we are parsing the data a little bit differently Now, far be it from me, Mr. Chairman, as you've reminded me many for the Let's not be driven by market expectations.'  So even though markets expect giving us space to do so, expectations for tapering are way high and uniform I've seen, I'm going to set that aside, and I'm not going to mention it.

They case, and the externalities, they become normal economic thought-just as in the ethanol and farm bill subsidies.  I very careful and set the criteria for adjusting the pace of asset and fairly substantial increase in long-term interest rates.  It's I listened to yesterday and what I expect to hear argument for deferring action?  Well, if rates went up because that the proper response is In June, we announced a framework purchases.  The result was a sharp this rise in rates that people apparently have in mind around this table when they refer to 'a tightening of financial conditions.'  And it's this rise in rates that seems to be the main argument for deferring action at this meeting, from what today.  Is the rise in rates a good people don't properly understand the framework, then it seems to me to improve our communications.  We tried that, and it made some difference, but not much.

criteria announced in June were too easily satisfied.  Perhaps, in 'tighter financial conditions,' as if they were some exogenous influence on the a change in our plans. An alternative interpretation is that people do understand the framework, but that we around this table failed to fully appreciate its implications.  Now some of us are having second thoughts.  Perhaps the retrospect, we ought to have imposed a higher standard of proof.  But please, let's not point a finger at economy forcing as a signal that the Committee is hell-bent on ending the asset purchase program In this case, the best thing we can do is to demonstrate over A third alternative is a variation of the first that I just mentioned:  There's nothing wrong with the framework laid out in June, but people don't believe we mean it.  They interpret the announcement regardless of the incoming data.

September 17-18, 2013

asset purchases up or down in response to incoming data.  To my mind, that economic risks that we are worried about we don't see those materialize.  And one parenthetical note:  This morning the dollar was trading has been over the past several months against our major trading partners.  So the of risks have simply not changed by a significant amount relative to June to justify doing nothing at this meeting.  Doing nothing would increase uncertainty about would call the credibility of our communications into question, time that we're sticking to the program that we laid out, as President Plosser mentioned, adjusting the pace of means modestly trimming the pace of purchases at this meeting while being prepared to hold steady or even reverse course if the downside materialize, and being prepared to follow up with further trimming if downside risks exactly where it outlook and the balance or July the future conduct of policy.  It as was mentioned earlier-and, I believe, Mr. Chairman, your personal credibility as well.

the 7 percent level, as mentioned by President Plosser, which would likely signal By our January meeting, for all we know, the unemployment rate may have reached or flirted with completion of the asset purchase program.  That's how it's understood in the marketplace, despite the nuances we like to infer.

financial conditions have, indeed, I mentioned am not only open to but would also advocate that asset purchase trimming be limited been sympathetic to did vote for the MBS program in the I believe it worked.  So I would limit the tapering the very end of his Keynesian analysis. Now, it's principally in the housing market that tighter obtained.  They're manifest.

I beginning because I felt it was necessary, and to Treasuries.  President Rosengren worked that in at And indeed, by signaling that the Committee is sensitive to the potential for an MBS taper to

But I agree with any significant push in that direction is probably best deferred until year, given the changes that are likely to occur in this Committee.  I'm not sure at this time.  But I want to push that later under the next Chairperson As yesterday-especially you, Mr. Chairman, that sometime next we'd be terribly credible and under our new leadership with the new composition of the Committee.

I don't consider it tightening if we ease off on the you look at what together with the reinvestments, we're talking about reducing by 10 percent the and we're still adding accommodation.  I think that can be clearly press conference. I think we perform a disservice to ourselves and the great institution we serve when we flinch from acknowledging the facts, when we look for excuses not to act.  Now, I realize that we're haunted by the accommodation by moving $10 billion in Treasuries off the purchase list.  If we're doing amount of purchases, explained in the long and hard-about whether we will really be able, as President in the face of the fiscal cliff and all of the As to the future, I would think very long and hard, Mr. Chairman-and I'd ask this Committee to think very Plosser mentioned, to muster the courage to move

MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Although it's going to support alternative B.  As data present an ambiguous picture-in fact, too ambiguous a picture.  The represented by the SEP central tendency may be overly optimistic, and the the outlook are to the downside.  That as between starting to taper now or sustaining purchases a while longer and starting to taper later, but likely very soon.  This is a tight set of decision options.  I do not believe options are realistically on the table-that is, to sustain purchases indefinitely, the open-ended posture that we started with, or to increase purchases.  There may be arguments for these policy stances, but the markets and public have not been prepared for the serious Committee of those options.  Indeed, the three policy options on the table today, presented at this meeting, reflect this reality that we have consists, realistically, of tapering now or evidence, is the economy strong enough to move ahead in So if one accepts that the array of choices today soon, then I think there are some relevant decision criteria, and I'll frame those decision criteria as four questions.  First, based on data

September 17-18, 2013

LSAP stimulus and, relatively shortly, with LSAP stimulus eliminated?  Call criterion.  Second, how confident is the Committee in the presented in the central tendency of the SEP?  Call that a confidence criterion, delay to the October I see this as a short-term efficacy criterion. For me, that's a credibility criterion. a state of declining this the current economic strength outlook as meaning our confidence in the outlook.  Third, what is to be gained from a or December meeting in terms of plausibly improved data, accumulated short-term direct effects of purchases on the economy, and greater certainty? And, fourth, what does it take to preserve and protect the Committee's credibility and act consistently with recent communications?

I size up the situation relative to these questions.  There are reasons to have recent data.  If the outlook chance of underperformance than At the same time, little will be gained by waiting until October.  The economy and October, by early December, we may have information that gives more Here's how some reservations about the strength of the economy as evidenced by plays out near what is expected, that's fine, but there is more outperformance. will absorb a modest start of tapering in the amount of $10 billion.

I see the merits of including the optional language coming meetings' fact, I think failure to include this language may bring on undesired interpretations of what, in the minds of many in the Committee is reversing guidance, since, in my view, a decision to delay until October or would prefer to guidance.

I think that on the basis of our inflation projections, we can afford to be patient in assessing the future of program, possibly have been feasible.  My economies strengthen in coming quarters.  However, I think we can wait until we see moretangible signs that such a development is occurring before taking of purchases.

comments on the policy options in front of us.  Let's begin with B, paragraph 4, the phrase 'at its coming meetings.'  In my view, this phrase should I associate myself with comments by President Williams and President Lockhart.  I as marginally helpful to the Committee should we decide that October is an I advise the Committee of the weight concerning future directional decisions for monetary policy on a as the December meeting, because macroeconomic events at that particular be conducive to major policy action. I have several alternative be included. see this phrase opportune moment to reduce the pace of purchases by a small amount. not to put all single meeting, such juncture may or may not rate projections during the press conference.  Governor Yellen made an Also in alternative B, in paragraph 5, there's an optional phrase at the very end.  I think that this phrase should be omitted and that we should simply let the Chairman discuss the 2016 SEP policy important pitch for the interpretation of the 2016 SEP policy rate embedded in this sentence.

September 17-18, 2013

reason rates are still low at the 2016 juncture is that unspecified First of all, while this is a good issue for ramifications of productivity growth, and slow growth of would then feed back into macroeconomic The key idea is that the persistent headwinds will still be abating at that point. the Committee to discuss, I do not think we have thought through all of the including such a phrase in the statement, and, in this sense, I agree with Presidents Rosengren and Williams.  In my own view, including this phrase would significantly increase the risk of sending an unwarranted pessimistic signal about the state of the U.S. economy in 2016, a situation about which we have very little knowledge.  In particular, that 2016 economy may be interpreted as one with low real interest rates, low national income.  Sending a pessimistic signal today decisionmaking today, depressing investment behavior, for example.

years has been based on work by Michael Woodford and his coauthors.  The SEP could be viewed as part of an optimal anticipated the Committee's policy intentions for 2016, it would induce, according to the B. Much of the 'lower for longer' policy discussion that has revolved around this table over the last several relatively low policy rate in 2016 projected in the policy strategy consistent with Woodford's work.  If so, to the extent that markets have not already theory, more consumption and investment today.  I think we should at least leave this possibility on the table, and therefore, for this reason, I think we should omit the last sentence of paragraph 5 in alternative whole purpose of forward guidance might be called into question with that future More broadly, the the explanation suggested in the last sentence of paragraph 5.  A provocative way to put this is, perhaps we should abandon all attempts at forward guidance if all we are saying is economic prospects are bleak.

September 17-18, 2013

alternative C, paragraph 4, there are two options.  The one labeled just '4' makes no includes a reference to the 7 rate.  I have some comments on this, which would enshrine 7 percent as a 7 percent level of unemployment is crossed.  Given the recent behavior of Committee.  Unemployment could easily cross we are currently, as a Committee, in no position to be at zero purchases In reference to a 7 percent unemployment rate, and paragraph 4' percent unemployment threshold for the asset purchase program.  This reference suggests that purchases will be zero at the time that the unemployment, I see this as quite reckless for the 7 percent very soon, and that quickly.  Accordingly, if we went with alternative C, I would suggest 4 over 4'.

giving equal time to all options here.  In alternative A, about how to introduce an inflation floor in the forward an inflation floor, so I wanted to comment on this.  I do think that if we way to the 2½ percent I agree with the Chairman's assessment that forward guidance, given upcoming changes in going forward, and so I wanted known-that I'd like this to be more symmetrical than what it is here. Let me turn now to alternative A, paragraph 5, there is some language guidance.  I've supported move in this direction, inflation thresholds should be symmetrical.  The inflation floor, therefore, should be 1½ percent and should be viewed and worded in a symmetrical threshold on inflation on the high side.  However, this is an inopportune time to try to strengthen our Committee composition.  But this is an issue that may be salient to make my preferences Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

further consideration that ahead, or we could look at a current you're looking at a projected we should be putting our target in.  Symmetry is CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  I just would raise for we could look at projected inflation, one to two years measure of inflation, underlying inflation-something like that.  If level, I think it's a good question whether or not

September 17-18, 2013

I think the number to put in there a very important question we need to think about. not the entire consideration here.  I just raise the question.  But is actually mostly. MR. BULLARD.  Yes.  In the past, I've liked to not put the forecast in there, because any credible central bank should be saying that inflation is going to go back to target relatively soon. So I think that's a conundrum for both of our thresholds-on the high side,

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Evans.

I was coming into this meeting with an open mind.  That's true.  However, having alternative B as MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I said in public commentary before this meeting that said that, I don't think anybody will be surprised that, ultimately, I do favor written.

It strikes me that most alternative C seem as though our June framework was to put us on a preset I signed up for.  Last June, I reluctantly agreed to our year if the outlook improves.  I had to remind myself, by looking at the SEPs, that the lower today than it was in June.  I think that would be a little bit troubling if we do something like alternative C.  It's reasonable to have opened up all of these communication on that is so But, nevertheless, that's what we said, and it was conditional on our optimistic a framework, and Chairman Bernanke clarified that at the a very positive effect in clarifying what we intended. Maybe this is an unfair characterization, but let me say it anyway. of the arguments for course for September, and that's not what plan to announce that we expected to begin dialing back our asset purchase flow rate sometime later this SEP outlook is were to actually options and to talk about the conditions under which we would begin dialing back, but, in the past, I've preferred not to discuss exit prematurely, just because the difficult. projections being on track.  That was NBER.  When he mentioned that we're not on a preset course, that had terms of

I said yesterday, I continue to think the exercise has many flaws.  For instance, I had a well.  And that provides a counterweight to our policy accommodation. I have worried that the value of our SEPs in this exercise is less than what we would hope for.  As much more aggressive monetary policy assumption in my June SEP, and that was an important fundamental for the improving outlook.  Since then, long-term interest rates have gone up; Baa rates have gone up as fully adequate, we've had weak economic activity and we've had weak inflation, and I come down on quite optimal monetary policy that I can bring myself to put in the SEP. I have been reluctant to say that our monetary policy stance has been because the side that there's inadequate aggregate demand-the zero lower bound has hurt us in that regard.  So it's not really

are different viewpoints and different ways to interpret the data.  I think alternative hypothesis.  I got the sign wrong in my question what I should have been pointing out.  He was saying that we might growth lower while we still have employment stronger.  So it was a low-productivity was trying to get at was, there are other refutable implications for these we put these hypotheses out there, we want to examine what other they have, because that's where they're potentially refutable.  I would have guessed of Phillips curves could lead to higher price adjustment, and so we accommodative monetary policy.  So I'm interested to evidence on that, but there's a lot of uncertainty. Now, there Governor Stein put out an interesting yesterday, so let me clarify be seeing environment.  What I hypotheses.  Whenever implications that unit labor costs might go up in that environment.  So short-run marginal costs could go up, pricing behavior outside might see uplift in inflation.  That would be confirming evidence, I think, for that viewpoint, and it would suggest less scope for strongly see more that yesterday we had a good review of recent I said I was open minded.  I thought developments since our July meeting, and frankly, for me, there's just too much uncertainty,

I previously said that I'd like growth to assess whether growth is potentially strong enough to sustain force developments, as opposed to having the I've credibility today by acting?  Later this year and December, and, if the expected improvement is eventually deemed evident, given that to see third-quarter GDP further employment gains and improving labor unemployment rate fall for the wrong reasons.  I don't view this as backtracking on what said in the past, because it was conditional on the outlook being strong enough.  And we can come down in different places on that, but for me, I think the outlook hasn't been strong enough. Why should we risk a regretful outcome on our includes October then we can act, as we'd said before.

also worried about the linkage between our asset purchase announcements and our It's being tarnished by misperceptions of our perseverance with regard makes me nervous.

Lastly, in paragraph 4, we have asset purchases, the Committee will improvements in labor markets and inflation moving back toward its objective.  I worry about that.

President Pianalto. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.

I noted yesterday, compared with the year ago, both labor market conditions and the outlook for labor markets have meeting, the decline in the unemployment rate and our asset purchases while remaining open to making adjustments as I prefer alternative C today. MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As situation a improved considerably.  Since our previous continued gains in private payroll employment reinforce the picture of ongoing labor market improvement.  In my view, we should acknowledge the progress labor markets have made since last September and slow required.  Therefore,

C as being the alternative most consistent with our prior guidance provided through your June press statement that I at this meeting would provide markets with a clearer Given my view of the progress we've seen in labor markets, as well as my economic outlook, I see alternative communications.  It delivers on the reductions in asset purchases would cease in the vicinity of a 7 percent unemployment rate. also think reducing our asset purchases view on the likely timing and structure of remaining asset purchases.

We're unlikely to learn that much between now and the end of data, it's unlikely that many of our views about could leave us waiting until December to act, at expect the unemployment rate to be even closer to 7 percent.  In my mind, this Furthermore, it's difficult to see how any real advantage could be achieved by postponing action until our October October.  With one month's additional economic the outlook would change markedly.  And that which time I would call into question what conditions would likely lead the Committee to make adjustments to, and eventually stop, the purchase program.  So, again, adjusting our asset purchases today, I think, acknowledges progress toward the objective of this program of substantial improvement in the outlook for labor markets.

This reflects partially the for the inflation rate in 2016, but it also In my case, the SEP is providing the forward I would support in today's challenging environment. In terms of our longer-term objectives, my SEP submission has a fed funds 1.75 percent in 2016, while headwinds that are still affecting my outlook, particularly reflects an intentional decision to provide extra accommodation-that is, to keep the fed funds rate below the guidance of most any Taylor rule. guidance that forward guidance, of the options that are presented, I as agree with you, Mr. Chairman, that this is not the time to make forward guidance.

Although I changes to our

Others around the table have C for a lot of the explicitly chose what criterion we would tell the public we were could have expressed it more elastically.  We could have talked about things labor force participation more broadly, but we chose the outlook for conditions.  In June, we put more substance into that, more content into that, which MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  You did an excellent job yesterday of summarizing a wide array done so as well, so I don't need to repeat a lot of those.  I favor alternative reasons that have been discussed.  But for me, one is fairly decisive, and that is the value of following through on actions that are implied by our past communications.  When we originally rolled out this program, we very going to use:  the outlook for labor market conditions.  There are a wide array of things we could have chosen.  We that alluded to growth or labor market we explicitly deputized you to convey, Mr. Chairman.

that if economic conditions evolved as we expected, we'd begin tapering later year.  But we also tied the end of the program to 7 percent unemployment, and we were very was Governor Stein's proposal.  We said that, in the middle of next year we expect to end purchases, the unemployment rate would likely be in the vicinity of 7 of communicating the asset purchases was likely to vary with economic We said this explicit about this-this when percent.  We decided to make that link very explicitly, and that was a way way in which the reduction in the pace of conditions and the data as they came in.  And, sure enough, they've evolved since June.

So if we're going to start to taper in a way that's consistent Chairman to say, we need to get started. outlook for the labor market has changed.  It's improved.  We actually expect to get to 7 sooner than we did in June.  It now looks as though we're We might even get there with what we authorized the all that we've communicated to markets, we've We've had a lot of trouble communicating this year, and it was a got ourselves organized in June and settled on a framework to I would think we'd want to strive mightily to avoid the appearance of lurching to to end And then, on top of that, as a result of come into this meeting with a broad majority of market participants expecting us to begin tapering at this meeting. bumpy spring until we communicate. some new communication framework or some new strategy to govern how we're going our asset purchase program.

But we decided to close off a were going to focus on something a little more narrow, there was a chance that day like today, we'd have some considerations that we would have liked to that we've committed not to bring to bear on it.  The answer to ex post regret in this situation is a question.  How much faith do you want people to place in future about future monetary policy?  So for me, that suggests that today's I sense some ex post regret around the table.  Set been doing this asset purchase program.  And, if going to govern it, you can picture a lot of tapering.  You can picture a lot, and a lot of that has come up today.  President President Evans, and others have advanced a lot of lot of them.  We communicated that we which is the outlook for labor market conditions.  Well, that means that in the future, on a bring to bear on the decision, but any what we say in the

September 17-18, 2013

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President George.

MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative C.  We have taken costly steps over the past several months to prepare markets for a modest adjustment to the pace of asset purchases, and markets appear prepared for such an adjustment at this meeting.

about what constitutes substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor of monetary easing. improves monetary easing for some It is clear that our individual judgments vary, and, certainly, we've not developed any collective sense market.  My own reading of the language in the statement suggests we may have confused the stopping rule with the conditions needed to begin paring back on the level Our statement says we will continue until the outlook for the labor market substantially, and I think an action today to modestly reduce the pace of purchases, even if our individual or collective outlook hurdle is not met, clearly continues time.

reported last January that the average monthly employment gain in 2013 that the average monthly employment year is expected to be 192,000.  In the September 2012 Tealbook, the projection for you keep that forecast horizon the As I've noted in past meetings, I see substantial progress continuing in labor markets. The Blue Chip survey was expected to be 158,000.  Their latest survey indicates gain next employment growth in mid-2014 was around 200,000, and, if same, the projection in the current Tealbook for employment growth in mid-2015 is about 250,000.

continue to support the road map for purchases that the Chairman presented at the June been sufficiently positive to continue with this I press conference and view the data as having

September 17-18, 2013

guidance, and market expectations, my at this meeting.  Reducing both Treasury and MBS C, is acceptable, although I would suggest that we have the research finds very slight spillover effects of Treasury purchases and Treasury-only purchases would do little to tighten plan.  Consistent with this road map, our previous preferred course of action is to begin tapering purchases, as proposed in alternative latitude to adjust that mix based on recent research, including that by Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jørgensen.  That suggests that an adjustment of $10 billion in broader financial conditions.

signaling that increases in the fed funds rate after liftoff are estimates in our SEP is from ½ to 4¼ percent.  And so, to provide more clarity, I could to the statement would carry a formal path after liftoff, which I could see as a I also support the idea of likely to be gradual as we assess the economy's response.  However, the qualitative guidance along the lines of alternative B would not reduce uncertainty, in my view, given that the current range of support incorporating the median estimate of the funds rate from the SEP into our FOMC statement.  Moving this information from the SEP endorsement of the Committee regarding the likely valuable tool as we approach exit.

I advocate for this initial modest reduction in purchases, I share the desire to see and to be assured that no setbacks lie ahead-even to achieve But it seems to me that waiting for more evidence in the discounts the real progress we have seen and I am mindful that we and to promise near-zero rates into the future.

year that it anticipates reducing the flow of purchases by the end of 2013.  The MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Committee communicated earlier this challenge with implementing this communication is that the decisions about the timing and the

September 17-18, 2013

reductions could affect the public's beliefs about the Committee's future strategy: unemployment rate or even what actions the Committee might take before the unemployment from the events of the past three or four months, and that is program are spilling over and affecting beliefs forward guidance. magnitude of in particular, what actions the Committee might be likely to take when the falls below 6½ percent rate reaches 6½ percent.  This is not a hypothetical proposition.  I think this is one of the key lessons, one we should take away that our communications about the asset purchase about all elements of our going to propose two solutions to this problem we face.  One is a narrow, and the other is broader and more strategic in nature.  Let me start with Backward in time, I would reducing purchases in December, assuming the outlook around the table who have been arguing in favor the sense that we're unlikely to see enough hard information about the forward and reduce purchases in December, see enough Today I'm incrementalist approach, the narrow solution.  I'll work backward in time associated with this. advocate that we do follow through by evolves accordingly.  I'm sympathetic to those of alternative C today, in evolution of the outlook in the next two months to really change the perception of what that outlook is.  This narrow solution is to carry assuming the outlook evolves accordingly.  As I suggested, it's unlikely we'll information to go back on that.

go in $10 billion going to be an existential crisis every meeting for a long time to come. reason to be thinking about bigger chunks.  I'm open on that dimension.  I'd that I think the act of reducing is having a lot more content for us and for markets than considering.  And that might be an argument for chunking things a little We should think about the size of this reduction pretty carefully.  If we chunks, I think there's There might be a just say the size that we're larger.

September 17-18, 2013

I would not go forward with what I just said in December without taking the correct sure that this problem that I started with does not occur, and that is this of our decisions about the timing and magnitude of reductions in purchases what we're going to be doing in the future after we get to 6½ percent and below have to work on our forward guidance and our communication to alternative A.  I'm skeptical of the value of changing, in that last percent back to 6½ percent, as President Williams suggested.  I think the has been extremely ineffective.  We should be going to do in a quantitative way, and I am committing the Committee to keep interest rates low until the percent.  If we do not provide quantitative guidance, then this Every decision we make about the purchase program will be influencing about what we're going to do after the unemployment rate falls below 6½ But steps in October to make spillover in terms influencing about interest rates.  We harden beliefs about the future strategies of the Committee through communications along the lines of the last paragraph of paragraph of A, from 6 qualitative guidance that we've offered in the past prepared to make this decision soon about what we're perfectly comfortable with unemployment rate falls to 6 problem will still exist. the public's beliefs percent.

would explain the decision to not taper in terms of this need to sharpen I about what we intend to do as economic conditions evolve.  So that's my as follows:  In September, explain the decision forward guidance; in October, actually do sharpen our by changing the last paragraph of alternative B along the lines of what's in A; In September, I our forward guidance-Mr. Chairman, you will have the opportunity to do this later today. think that any observer of the past three or four months would recognize that the Committee has a problem on this dimension, and that we need to be stronger, more forceful, and, perhaps most importantly, clearer narrow incrementalist approach, which would be not to taper via the need to sharpen our forward guidance

September 17-18, 2013

anticipate that it will.  That's my narrow incrementalist approach I see-the fact that every move we make on the purchase program is having a going to do on every aspect of our future policy. and then, finally, in December, reduce purchases, assuming the outlook evolves accordingly, which I guess, definitionally, I to the problem that big influence on investors' beliefs about what we're course of monetary

I truly favor, but it has, I think, little support, a relentlessly goals-oriented approach to policy.  Specifically, we always should can to align the medium-term outlook with the long-term goals we Well, the answer would be, if we look at paragraph 2 of any of the alternatives-A, B, or that.  The second paragraphs say explicitly that the medium-term that is gradually declining and inflation running below The broader solution is the one that unfortunately, in the Committee.  We just need to be much more systematically strategic.  We have to follow be doing whatever we enunciated in the January statement.  A reasonable question would be, aren't we already doing this? C-that we're not doing outlook involves elevated unemployment target over the medium term.  We should provide more accommodation until, explicitly, either unemployment or inflation is hitting its target.

not just an aesthetic preference for consistency that's driving this.  We face the costs goals-oriented approach on an ongoing basis.  As soon as we don't follow a goalsthat other things are affecting our decisions.  What, exactly, are these I actually don't know the answer to this, and I presume markets don't know, either. guesswork about what those are.  Every action we take, like reducing met with, 'Wow, there must be something else going on in their minds.  What is it, interest rates, and the effectiveness of It's of not using a oriented approach, it means other things? So there's a lot of purchases, is exactly?'  And that influences, then, term premiums, policy.

Is it the cost of the Every piece of that is influencing Relatedly, it really makes communication challenging.  Even communication can affect beliefs in a major way because, are these other factors that are influencing balance sheet?  How big are those?  What do those mean? market beliefs.

going forward, it's important to live up to them. dwarfed by the need to maintain strategic credibility.  And what I mean is, it's the need to be always driving toward our goals in a relentless fashion.  If we do not goals. Lockhart mentioned the disturbing data on employment by failing to provide accommodation when unemployment much risk the credibility of the long-term goals as rapidly as we possibly can over the medium term. There's been a lot of talk about credibility today.  And it is important for us to live up to tactical credibility.  When we enunciate plans But tactical credibility is by that do that, we risk, I think, the biggest loss of credibility, which is the credibility of our When we run below our inflation target-President this-this is not exactly the way to build confidence in the fact that we have a 2 percent inflation target.  We're not building confidence in the notion that we're concerned about high unemployment and low is elevated and inflation is low.  So I think we very goals that we enunciated in our January statement if we don't actually make choices that drive us toward those

I think it matters-it really makes don't follow a gradual increase of inflation back to target over a five- or six-year-long Finally-and this is not as big a deal, but decisionmaking much harder for this Committee on an ongoing basis if we strategic, goals-oriented approach, because if we're comfortable with a gradual decline of unemployment and a period, lots of other things can come into play at that stage.  How we feel about every tool of accommodation starts to influence our decisionmaking.  And, boy, that makes it very hard to

September 17-18, 2013

If, on the other hand, you're always driving for the goals, then the only tension your medium-term outlook for inflation versus your medium-term outlook for that really narrows reach decisions. is, what is unemployment?  Those can be very heated and complicated discussions, but down the range of conversation and decisionmaking appropriately, I think.

goals-oriented approach of the kind I describe imply for today? A, because A still has its paragraph 2 of only gradual are other things we could be thinking about.  We could be lowering the rate on excess reserves.  Mr. Chairman, I thought your idea of pegging I think the quantity of assets on the because we're trying to influence rates and longer-term yields.  And so What would a relentlessly It would imply doing more than alternative returns to target.  There unemployment rate threshold even below what's suggested in alternative A, to 5.5 percent.  We could lower the interest rates was very interesting-I'm not buying assets because balance sheet matters, but that's a very powerful argument for actually trying to operate directly in rate space as opposed to quantity space.

your patience even longer, fellow members of the Committee, I'll that reductions of purchases, content about the Committee's future strategy.  I've offered two one, which is to adopt a more consistent, always act to align our I favor the broader one, but you should never of the good, and so the narrow one is something that I hope we can But at the risk of trying try to wrap up quickly here.  I think the key problem we face is even if small, have undue signal solutions to this problem:  a narrow one, which is to attempt to harden our forward guidance in October and then reduce purchases; and a broader goals-oriented approach to formulating our monetary policy in which we medium-term outlook with our longer-term goals. let the best be the enemy work on.

There has undeniably been a lot of improvement in the labor market since we started the asset purchase program a year that score, I think a as my lingering doubts about the potential for further improvements going anticipate that we'll see steady improvement in the labor market, and that inflation will move up toward our 2 percent objective, a scenario along the general lines of that laid out by the Chairman in his wiser not to move today in the labor market will be sustained.

to me, strike the right balance.  They they the current circumstances, it's prudent to await further confirmation that clearly pace of purchases on the table without raising the bar for what we'd The new sentences in paragraph 3 of alternative B, acknowledge the improvement in labor market conditions since we began our program, but also point out that, in those improvements will be sustained.  The new language in paragraph 4 of alternative B keeps a reduction in the need to see in the data.

B signals that we're willing to be patient in adjusting the pace of our and emphasizes that we remain focused on implementing policies that will achieve our market participants on winding down the asset purchase program for reasons we've not efficacy or costs, including financial stability risks.  I with President Kocherlakota that the same perception is undermining the credibility of our Alternative purchases dual mandate objectives.  It gently pushes back against the view that many have that we're hell-bent clearly articulated, perhaps relating to agree

It also highlights our concern that the deterioration in financial conditions attainment of our objectives. forward guidance. we've seen in recent months could undermine the purchases today does entail some yields appear to be due importantly to higher and even our December meetings, we may conceivably labor market progress as we are now.  For that progress but also to point to the cumulative progress we've seen since Actual progress matters, and we may well make further progress. all else being equal, the greater our cumulative progress, the more confident we can be than after we've passed through Columbus, find ourselves at the Weehawken entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel. Of course, a decision not to reduce the pace of our risks.  The increases we've seen in longer-term term premiums, in part reflecting heightened uncertainty about monetary policy.  A decision to maintain our current pace of purchases may not alleviate, and could exacerbate, this uncertainty. Moreover, by the time of our October remain just as uncertain about the sustainability of reason, I think it's important, as paragraph 3 of alternative B does, not only to stress our uncertainty about future the start of our program. Indeed, that we will ultimately reach our mandated maximum employment goal-the main purpose of the asset purchase program since the outset-and the safer it should become to reduce the pace of purchases.  Put differently, it's a lot more reasonable to worry that we won't arrive in Manhattan when we're in Denver or Kansas City Ohio, or

yet further, I might not want to reduce the pace of purchases if I thought, for example, of some adverse event such as a fiscal or financial crisis.  But the more achieve, the smaller should be the set of circumstances that would justify a decision purchases.  That's why I think the stance expressed in the second paragraph 3 of alternative B, that we 'decided to await more evidence that progress not put us on a treadmill.  Each month that we see further improvement reduction in the pace of Lincoln That's not to say that all else is always equal.  For example, even if the unemployment rate falls that we were on the cusp progress we not to reduce the pace of sentence of will be sustained,' does in labor market conditions will raise my confidence that, even with a purchases, we will finish that 3,049-mile road trip from 101 Market Street in San Francisco via Denver, Kansas City, and Columbus, and happily emerge on the other side of the Tunnel.

I still expect to see further improvement over coming months, I would be okay with 'at its coming meetings' in paragraph 4 of alternative B. Since adding the bracketed text conclude with a brief comment on our forward guidance pertaining to the path of yesterday.  I see it as essential to the attainment of our and that it appropriately shapes market of our policies.  Since early May, one-year forward rates ending in three roughly 110 basis points, and those ending in four years by 160 basis points. rate, three to years ahead, has shifted down by 30 basis points.

I think it's more desirable for the Committee as a whole to opine on this topic.  I recognize across and that the language proposed at the end of paragraph perhaps more thought about framing or other language.  But I agree with It doesn't have to be today, but I'd like to see that in future meetings.

you.  Governor Tarullo. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with the many people who have what we are signaling also over the course of the next several quarters, in all assessment and positions, I want to return us for a moment to two market expectations. MR. TARULLO.  Thank suggested that our discussion and decision today are predominantly about about our policies not just today, but likelihood.  Just to preface my sets of institutional difficulties that we have with

I've said before, goes back to the origins of the current LSAP program in FOMC statement and, certainly, as perceived by time.  That's created a certain awkwardness since then, whereby we we didn't really want to push The first, as September 2012.  The program, as stated in the markets, probably did not reflect the broad consensus of the FOMC that was suggested by the strong vote that it had at the introduce concepts somewhat tentatively about efficacy or costs;

September 17-18, 2013

good reasons, even though they may have animated concerns of a number of in terms of the articulated those publicly for Committee members; and so we find ourselves having to talk publicly standard of substantial improvement in labor markets, even though people's own individual calculi are affected by a number of things other than that.

we all recall just from that meeting a few months ago, a convergent view on how we were going to proceed with LSAPs.  There who seemed to have much more of a chronology in mind:  We're headed going to proceed after that.  There are others who were leery I think, dictated the standards that the Chairman articulated in the press conference, were data driven but, obviously, communicated some lean toward taper. The second problem, which I think has become more apparent today, is that, once again, with the June so-called framework, as there wasn't really were several colleagues toward September, and then we're of making very many signals in any direction.  And then there were those in the middle, who, ultimately, which not only managing market expectations, I think is apparent in the really quite thoughtful, a cut or two above our normal hand, and yet reflecting genuine and good faith differences of So in my mind, what we have here is a matter of but also managing ourselves.  That makes this a very messy decision, as comments of people today, which are interventions, on the one perspective, on the other.

policy sense, what the standards for tapering would be.  And of one from the September 2012 FOMC that the Chairman articulated in June, a while that, for most people, one's Now let me turn to, in a course, we have two sitting side by side here:  the statement; and the second, the framework for tapering invoking and building on the September 2012 statement but trying to develop that a little further. Well, with respect to the September 2012 statement of overall substantial improvement in the outlook for labor markets, I think it's been pretty clear for

September 17-18, 2013

LSAPs is pretty closely correlated to one's has occurred.  Labor market conditions are force participation rate, or the fact that some traditional indicators of dynamism, even depressed by historical standards. going-in position on the wisdom and efficacy of position on how much labor market improvement potentially quite broad and encompass a general assessment of the health of the labor market, and so some want to focus on unemployment, and others want to point to net job creation, the labor though they're showing signs of life, are still pretty

I think people know, my own view is that there are still a fair number of questions, as going probably going to stay with us for a while as to how much is achievable It's also been my good bit more can be done now, and that a while as to whether we're approaching the limit of As I suggested yesterday, about the relative contributions of different explanations for what's on.  Those questions are in labor markets through policies intended to increase aggregate demand. position, which I continue to hold, that, pretty clearly, a we will not need to make a decision for what can be achieved in a prudent fashion.

'substantial'?  This is a classic legal word that gets inserted into a standard can be consistent with a variety of always thought we were going to have disagreements on that, and so we June press conference.  I do want to read those because there's been a little bit of selective and I think it's important to recall all of what he said.  Sorry, Mr. Chairman, I'm to you even as you sit two seats down from me. Now, what's and then is susceptible to a variety of interpretations that going-in positions.  So I do.  I think we can pin down a little bit more, though, the standards that the Chairman articulated in his text use today, repeating history, your own history, back

[Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Go ahead.

attention of the reporters and the public to MR. TARULLO.  He began by drawing the the economic outcomes that the Committee saw as most likely, that is, those reflected in the June

September 17-18, 2013

'involve continuing gains in labor markets, supported by growth that picks up over the next several quarters as the near-term restraint from We also see inflation moving back toward our If the incoming data are broadly consistent with this forecast, the anticipates that it would be appropriate to moderate the monthly pace of year.' SEP.  Then he said that those outcomes moderate fiscal policy and other headwinds diminishes. 2 percent objective over time. Committee currently purchases later this a benchmark to whether it's appropriate to begin to taper.  Now, those are not hard of sentences later, he said, 'In this scenario'-that is, our collective SEP projectionsThe 7 percent as a number that drew attention to the fact that dependent.  At the a number that was explicitly linked to the path projected by the So he's established our collective expectations as stated in the June SEP as for our later decisions as numbers, obviously; they're still qualitative standards.  But that was the benchmark.  And then, a couple 'when asset purchases ultimately come to an end, the unemployment rate would likely be in the vicinity of 7 percent, with solid economic growth supporting further job gains.' figure was, I think, intentionally placed in there this was not a chronologically driven process but instead one that was data same time, however, it was FOMC itself in its June SEP.

good faith and say, 'Gee, what has lower 'over the next several quarters as the near-term and other headwinds diminishes.'  I think a good case can be made Now, I think one can look at that with a fair degree of happened since June?'  The central tendency of the SEP in September is actually for growth in the rest of 2013 and into 2014.  There has been, then, inarguably, no realization of the expectations that moderate growth will pick up restraint from fiscal policy for the proposition, with a fair reading, that the standard that the Chairman articulated in June

September 17-18, 2013

'X' and then do 'not X.' clearly an area in which there's some uncertainty. arguably hasn't been met.  This is not a case in which we would say It's way I heard Jay yesterday and John today in their is that a reasonable external observer listening could well think that the June expectations had been met.  And somebody earlier made expectations, not quite as unanimous as, I yesterday, I thought, made pretty clear that Having said that, I would say that the descriptions of their own assessments of the data carefully the point that there's been some building of those think, some have specified here.  Simon and Steve there was some divergence of views, even though the preponderance of expectations was toward tapering.

my own priors and working assumptions looking at it, as articulated, all, and, again, my policy priors would lead me in the direction of not tapering. So I would say that, trying not to be driven by about labor market conditions and health, I think it's a close case whether the standards have been met.  It's been the case for quite some time that one can massage the 'substantial improvement' standard either to have realized it or to have not realized it.  Just you can tell, in a quasi-legalistic fashion-are we meeting standards that have been and will it be clearly erroneous not to act based on those standards?-I don't think it's a clear case at meeting has been what Narayana talked and today-and Janet, I think, just alluded to as well-which is that there actions on LSAPs as an indication of going to increase the people on this I recognize that manifold How strong is the But for me, the key consideration going into this about both yesterday has been a pretty pronounced market tendency to read our our overall policy orientation.  This includes expectations on when we're federal funds rate, despite the best efforts of the Chairman and many other Committee to draw distinctions between those two policy instruments. sources of uncertainty surround expectations on the federal funds rate now:

September 17-18, 2013

of where that trajectory is going to be, and are our intentions?  Those dilemmas I noted earlier that exist because of the greater our internal views than we communicated externally probably sow some confusion, there are some questions around leadership succession So there are many things affecting that judgment, but it still does seem that at expected I to where Charlie Plosser began-with the proposition, with which I agree, that signaling is remain concerned that even a mild taper today will be read as, at a switch.  I know we don't intend it as ineluctable or inexorable, and we to whether there's been just good improvement economy, which obviously affects people's sense what exactly variance of and, as many people have mentioned, here at the Fed. least a part of the market-driven, as opposed to analyst-driven, pulling forward of the date of liftoff is due to this general reading of what our orientation is-and I think that anecdotally and otherwise, we've had some reinforcement for that proposition.  In that sense, return what this decision is about.  I least in part, flipping can do what we can, beginning with the Chairman's press conference, to push back against that expectation.  But to me, in all honesty, it's what's been gripping me the most about this issue since June, as opposed to very fine distinctions as or substantial improvement or moderate improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions.

come down, in the end, for alternative B, but with some of the hesitancy and concerns I think have been reflected in the statements of a number of you who also came down, in the B.  As Janet and several others have said, I think, the emphasis in the is on assessing 'whether incoming information continues to support the is on the notion that we're alternative B is making sure that is, I think, the way we all want to frame it. I that end, for alternative proposed statement Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement.'  The emphasis still walking down that path and that the decision today under there's no backsliding.  This

September 17-18, 2013

alternative B and indicated why that's the way in which I've been I think, is a little would be better for us but then get into October or December and going to draw attention back to conditions and how much then, in October or December, instead gradual progress, if there's in the quality of the data coming in and we taper nonetheless, that risks LSAPs and probably, then, moving the federal funds rate up more quickly as well. Having made a case for leaning, I do want to close with just one caution, which gets back to this issue of managing ourselves as well as market expectations.  What I'm about to say, counterintuitive, but bear with me for a minute.  From my point of view, it to taper a little today on the basis of this mixed record that is susceptible to different interpretations than it would be to not taper today have more people saying, 'Oh, we really need to taper,' regardless of what's going on outside. The reason I say that is, if we don't taper today based on a mixed record-and I think the record would justify not tapering-that is improvement there is and how things are picking up.  But of what most people expect, which is continued unspectacular but something of a setback telling the public, the markets, and everybody that the FOMC is just hell-bent on a strategy of getting out of this is a plea for a little collective self-diagnosis as to whether we are going to be Those are the next four meetings.  If that's not the case, then, instincts as to what, in a close case, is the better thing to do, I would rather have us taper today than have four more members of the Committee, in December, say, 'We've just got to do it now,' regardless of what's happened Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So comfortable staying with a data-dependent set of assessments in October and December and January and March. notwithstanding my policy genuinely October or externally.

September 17-18, 2013

I could ask the indulgence of the last few speakers, Let's come back at 10:30 and complete CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  If maybe it would be a good time to take a coffee break. the meeting.

[Coffee break]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Governor Stein.

B at this meeting, in I do so with MR. STEIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will vote for alternative part based on President Fisher's admonition about Switzerland.  [Laughter]  But some reluctance because I think alternative C is the decidedly better option.

support, the ultimate aim of alternative B-namely, to push back a bit I'm also somewhat less concerned about the cost of buying yesterday, and I agree with it:  To the extent that there was a for why there was a problem with just expanding the size of the balance sheet, it was in fundamental values. I think that's a completely fair point. Now, to be clear, my disagreement is more one of tactics and execution, not broad goals. I understand, and largely against the recent increase in rates. bonds now that the 10-year rate is in the neighborhood of 300 basis points as opposed to 150. Mr. Chairman, you made this point theory part based on financial stability issues, on pushing bond prices away from That was a bigger deal then than it is now.  So

Again, they're not focused on so far, I think we basically said two things to markets in purchases.  These are My objections, really, are not about the scale of the balance sheet. about not wanting to push back.  They're all around the issues that we've which are communication and messaging. recent months.  One thing we said is, 'Don't draw broad inferences about our reaction function and our commitment to forward guidance based on what we do with asset two separate tools.'  And Mr. Chairman, you worked very hard to hammer this point home after our June meeting and after the rise in short rates.  I thought it was exactly the right thing to do,

September 17-18, 2013

be.  Now, to some extent, we're going to end up doing a 180-degree you to draw a somewhat more dovish inference about us from that.'  So that's the first exactly the right place to turn on this because we're going to say, 'Oh, look, we're stepping back from the brink, and we invite point.

would going forward, and may make it harder to act at a future have noted, I don't at all want to give the argument that because the 'X,' you should do 'X.'  That's obviously not right.  When you're facing a consideration, not market expectations. Second, it's clear that we've led markets to believe one way.  I don't disagree with Dan's reading of the language in the press conference, but we've led markets to believe that we in fact do a small taper at this meeting.  I do think that not following through will cause some confusion about what our intentions are meeting.  Now, as others market expects policy decision in which there are real, direct economic costs and benefits, those should be the first order of

$85 billion or reducing fundamentals in a way the short rate would.  It's a token gesture.  It's our way of sending gotten ourselves stuck in this peculiar history-dependent a funny language in which '85' means one thing, means something very different and more hawkish.  It's very similar to a in which firms sometimes find themselves:  They feel as though, if they miss their guidance by one penny, that sends a discretely different signal to the market.  And so I that as an unfortunate condition that one wants to push back against, not just accept as a But here's the thing.  The choice between leaving the flow rate at it to $75 billion is not important because it changes the underlying policy that changing the path of smoke signals to the market.  We've equilibrium in which these are just words in and '85 minus epsilon' situation earnings think of fact of life.

September 17-18, 2013

we are playing what's entirely a communication game with the market, it's fair to add clarity or create confusion.  Importantly, I don't as something that's so laden with reaction this point-that this is where we find ourselves; meaning.  If we think about it dynamically, what we do today endorses and is going to make it harder for us to move in the future, economic conditions equal, because this word has acquired so much meaning. If evaluate decisions in terms of whether they think we want to be endorsing the use of '$85 billion' function meaning.  President Kocherlakota made it's really just so full of that vocabulary being

I understand the way you laid it out, Mr. get all of this game theory stuff.  But I want to be a macro pragmatist.  I agree with that. got to be pragmatic and work with the vocabulary I have.  And if that means saying '$85 a few more times, so be it, in some sense. Now, I think the counterargument-as Chairman-is fine.  I want to ease up a bit.  That's the right thing to do, from a macro perspective.  I I've billion'

a hard time macro-pragmatic aspect.  The question is-and President Williams raised a better vocabulary available?  Since it's all about communication, is there a I think there is.  Let me mention three things, where I think I'm out there one communication thing President Fisher mentioned was, if we vary the mix MBS versus Treasuries, does that signal a little bit of understanding about the housing seems like an interesting thing. So I think those are essentially the two different arguments, and I have disagreeing with the this-do we have better and more effective way to communicate? two of which I think there's at least some agreement around, and one on my own.  First, of market?  I'm certainly open to that; it if, at the end of the day, we're really commitment to the path of the short-term rate after liftoff, going to come back to that in a minute.  But in some sense, that's what we're Second, a number of people have mentioned that interested in communicating about our let's do that.  I'm

September 17-18, 2013

that via trying to talk about.  And, really, the question before us is, do we continue to talk about '$85 billion,' or do we talk about what we want to talk about?

I'm out on my own.  Here would be a suggestion:  Announce that LSAP program on a completely mechanical, unemployment-linked wind-down, 6.8 percent-I'll come back to that in just a second.  This is not a small taper at this afterward, we drop the flow rate $15 billion for each one-tenth tick have to put a cap in there somewhere in case the balance so it would be subject to not buying forever.  A stopping value of 6.8 Third, here's where we're putting the with a stopping value of something we've said, this is something different.  So, specifically, we do meeting.  Every meeting down in the unemployment rate.  We'd sheet gets really big, percent-no discretion going forward.  Simon can basically implement this with no further input from us.

place or not? MR. POTTER.  Second decimal

key-the no discretion.  There are two you wanted to send a more dovish message.  Well, you could, I did in this thing, move the unemployment rate from 7 to 6.8 percent.  That's a big deal.  The and 6.8 percent is maybe four more months, roughly speaking, of asset credible, I think, if you do it this way.  So if you're of discretion is really key.  It's the discretion that is the as Narayana said, we're going to face an existential crisis at every meeting I think some of us have been thinking, 'Oh, once we get past the first taper, It's not going to be good, because we've got this vocabulary, this thing means MR. STEIN.  We'll talk.  So here's the motivations.  On the one hand, say as difference between 7 purchases.  That's substantial and it's pretty just interested in saying something a little bit more dovish, that does it.  But I think-and this is totally central, in my view-the removal heart of our problem; as we go forward. life will be good.'

September 17-18, 2013

going to face the same problem over and over again.  I you kill the problem is by removing discretion. something at every meeting, and we're want to kill the problem, and I think the way you do this mechanical hard rule, the perfect summary statistic for the state of the labor market to go all John Taylor on you guys.  This is not thing in this case is, we have discretion over way I would try to was talking about in terms of the way you shape the forward guidance, alternative A-you make it very clear that after liftoff, going to be conditioning on exactly those things that we can't condition on if we subject to a mechanical stopping rule based on unemployment.  After liftoff, if labor going to crossing the 6½ percent Now, the counterargument would be, if unemployment rate, of course, is not a or for things we care about.  Look, I'm not trying about rules versus discretion.  The very important our other and more important tool, which is the path of the funds rate.  The explain this is, we're putting this thing on autopilot.  But-and I think this gets very close to what President Williams and a little bit of this is in paragraph 5 of we're the LSAP program force participation comes in a little weak or if inflation is lower, all of that, which we're explain now as clearly as possible, will shape how we behave after threshold.

I wanted to make clear the concerns I have over fair point that a number of people have raised:  You don't want to just 'I hate asset purchases, and I've hated them for a long time, and I want But I think the concern is no longer really over that, and this proposal, in fact, of asset purchases than whatever policy we go down the alternative B route.  I think it's really that we've got a doing ourselves, the incoming Chair, and the So that's basically the point.  Again, alternative B-there's a get locked into saying, them to die.' might lead us to do, in expectation, more in the way may be following if we communication problem.  We've felt it now at a number of meetings, and we're likely to feel it at a number of meetings going forward.  We'll be

I lean to a small taper at this meeting, combined with a sharpening of the Digging into that a little bit, I'm one of those who argues that the taper should be I'm definitely coming around to the view that there is an attraction in cutting with that to send a supportive signal for housing.  As far as goes, I continue to be reluctant to tinker with the thresholds.  But I think the we'll raise after liftoff.  As far as the former is concerned, I thought President Williams's a pause for thinking is a constructive one; it suggests that we will pause and think, this is what we'll think about.  And regarding the latter, I am comfortable with something alternative B that Governor Yellen and others have discussed.  Generally, it and forward guidance-without, it's hoped, writing too I think that's the way to go.  If you start to worry about the guidance your decision on whether to taper, that's a road that's fraught with trouble. Specifically, guidance. symmetrical, but just Treasuries.  So I'm okay guidance sharpening Committee should think about doing two things, the first of which is to emphasize the likelihood that we will be slow footed when it comes to liftoff, and the second of which is that rates slowly suggestion for and like the language in seems to me that the only real way to break the connection between asset purchases guidance is really to find a way to strengthen the many blank checks.  But and that affects

September 17-18, 2013

yesterday that current conditions would support a small this meeting.  The communications and tactical issues also point in that I do think it's a case that can be argued on the other side, and was On the decision to taper, I argued reduction in purchases at direction.  And by the way, very well argued by Dan.

Fed watcher thinks so, even those who oppose any such move.  Sixteen of I talked to does a private survey of the desks of to do a small or a medium-sized taper-that was mine who runs a a small taper and recommending that clients position that way as well. got a free option to move.  Folks believe you will and should take much likelihoodgoing to see a situation again anytime soon in which the market is quite this sure about Market sentiment is clearly that the Committee will reduce purchases at this meeting. Nearly every major the 21 dealers think so.  One of the hedge funds the major dealers, and 8 of 8 of them expect us true both before and after the first estimate of August payrolls.  A friend of large pension fund sent me something from the desk of one of the big dealers saying that the desk was positioned for My friend talks to a lot of market participants, and he's not somebody who has got a lot of dollars down on this bet, so it's not influenced by that.  But his words were, 'A modest taper is priced in.  You've essentially it.'  That's an exact quote.  So there's just no guarantee-and, frankly, not that we're it.

you look at the underlying probabilities, you can argue that this is like that.  I really do believe that this is more of a binary world you've got to make a decision based on the information you think something is 60 percent likely, you're going to say 'yes' every time.  It's Now, I know that if 60 percent likely or something out there.  I think this is a world where you have.  If like, you can't propose to somebody by saying, 'I'm 75 percent likely to ask you to marry me.' It's going to be one or the other.  [Laughter]

And in the short term, that's likely to good in the market, like a warm bath.  Depending on the rest of the message, financial to loosen a bit further.  My concern is more that as September turns to bath may get cold and clammy. In this world, the Street, everyone is very much positioned for this.  So that's the overwhelming expectation, independent of whether the market thinks it's a we think it's a good idea it's right or wrong; they tell us about our communications and about likely point is, I think this will feel conditions would be likely October and November and December, that warm are two possible stories that the market could take away from this.  One of them I the risk-management story that people have articulated:  We see a little weaker data, risk; we're weighing that, and we're thinking That, I think, is the good story.  If we can erratic signal, the market raise the bar for future tapering. There would call financial conditions tightening, and some event that it would be wise, and it would be prudent, to wait. make that story stick, we'll be okay.  The other story is that there is significant buyer's remorse in the Committee or we are just confused, we're sending a bit of an won't know what to do, and we'll significantly

forward lean in the press conference set the bar pretty low for future tapers in alternative B.  That's our think that that has to be the answer-or for me, it's the answer-if you're going to But it's a hard thing to explain.  There is just a tension, unavoidably, between and being ready to go, in a month or so, on the same data.  The comment will ready to go then.  It doesn't make sense.'  So there will be a desire to read more got to make the first explanation stick if going to go that way. Our answer to that is to go out with a pretty language.  I think we've answer, and I do alternative B. holding off now be, 'You had us into it, no matter what we do.  But I think we've really we're

September 17-18, 2013

or December.  If we don't do this now-and we're going to-it's quite plausible that we would be at this for your first taper.  So I just think that's reality. I would also echo another thing that Dan said, which is that we have to emotionally accept the idea that there's no guarantee of October it doesn't seem as though another six or nine months without being able to taper, because it's not going to be in our interest.  You can do a dovish surprise; you're not going to be well advised to do a hawkish surprise when the market is not ready for going to hold off today-I suspect, anyway.  And I will support B.  I would have a preference for C.  It's a very close call, but the Chairman has more wants.  Again, it's a very close call B.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I understand we're alternative than earned the right to go out on the monetary policy that he and plausible either way.  So I will support alternative

about whether to begin to reduce the pace of purchases, and it is a close call. reduction at this particular meeting, for economic activity has been a bit disappointing relative to our annual rate.  We've been forecasting a pickup in the growth rate for poor forecasting record in recent years, I don't VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I thought long and hard about the choice But I concluded that it was still premature to undertake a four reasons.  First, the pace of expectations.  Real GDP growth in the current quarter looks as though it's going to come in at only around a 2 percent quite a while, and it hasn't arrived yet.  Given our think we should act just on the basis of a forecast.

conditions have tightened in anticipation of a shift in monetary policy the economy.  I think evaluate the impact before we move in a way that might tighten financial conditions rise in mortgage rates is still Second, financial by more than we intended, certainly.  This does create a new headwind for we need to still further.  How much the housing sector will be hurt by the

of the time lag between offers to purchase a home and the closing of going to know a lot more about the impact of the higher mortgage rates highly uncertain because the contract, and we're on housing within the next few months.

at this meeting is bad relative to the substantial fiscal risks that going to take to play out, but I would that, by the end of the year, we'll have much greater resolution on that front. Third, I think the timing lie ahead over the near term surrounding prospects for the continuing budget resolution and the resolution of the debt ceiling.  I don't know how long that's certainly expect raised by Governor Powell, I think risk-management cautious approach.  If the economy proceeds as expected or is good-sized reduction in asset purchases in October or And, fourth, to go back to a point considerations really do suggest a stronger than expected, then we can do a December.  In contrast, if the economy is weaker than anticipated, I think we'll regret moving before we've actually seen a pickup in the economic growth rate.

risk that moving will generate a larger adjustment in financial conditions actual policy change.  I think most of us have been surprised by how big Treasury and mortgage rates has been since May.  And that occurred in response just about the possibility that we might reduce the purchase rate later this year, rather Also, there's a than is warranted by the the rise in to our musings than our actually doing so.  So I think we have to be cautious in that respect.

some reduction in the pace of asset purchases is anticipated confident now to begin a reduction in asset purchases, and that could send a more as we try to mitigate that signal by making a very small taper. In Now, while it's true that within the next few months, the actual decision to do so could trigger bigger effects than anticipated because of threshold effects.  The market would see us as being over the threshold, sufficiently powerful signal to the market even The whole idea of this small taper is to mitigate the signal of what this means to the market.

September 17-18, 2013

rate and inflation about sustainable I'd actually prefer to wait and start later with the current environment, with growth still stuck around a 2 percent annual below our 2 percent objective, it strikes me that we need to be pretty sure improvement in the labor market before we move. a larger taper, versus starting earlier with a smaller taper.

final consideration, if we don't taper at this meeting, it's actually going to be facility without having to worry that the testing a precursor to an earlier exit.  So the will be a lot easier, I think, if we don't taper at Also, as a easier to do this testing of the reverse repurchase is going to cause people to interpret that facility as being communication in terms of using the new facility this meeting.

argued that we should begin to taper because that's what market generally anticipate.  I don't think that's a good justification, for two reasons.  First, the market.  We never said we were going to move in September.  As conference, we said year,' if the economy evolves in line with our expectations.  We should emphasize gain credibility, I think, by being true to that.  Second, united in the view that going to disappoint someone.  At the end of yet?  I don't think we have. Some people have participants we can't be led around by Governor Tarullo pointed out when he went through the Chairman's press 'later this that the timing is data dependent, and we as Simon and others have mentioned, market participants are by no means we'll begin to move at this meeting, and so we're the day, what we have to be driven by is being true to what we said we were going to do-being data dependent.  Have we quite achieved the test are making progress on the labor market, and we are getting more confident going to get to our objectives.  But in light of the mixed data, the tightening of Now, the messaging of the action is extremely important, and I think we really want to cast this as, 'We that we're financial conditions, and the fiscal uncertainty right ahead, we're not quite over the threshold yet.

September 17-18, 2013

evolve in the way that we anticipate, we think we'll be over the threshold relatively If things soon.  But it will be dependent on the data.'

I guess my bias is that a decision to cut more in Treasuries than in agencies.  But that's splitting decision about whether to taper or not to taper. I don't have strong views in terms of Treasuries versus agencies. I'm not sure it makes that much difference.  At the margin, as we discuss this in the future, I would certainly accept hairs relative to the still at around a median of 2 percent in I think we really need to explain that it's because policy needs to be at a low interest rate a while to provide support so that we can just grow at a trend rate in 2016.  That's I don't think, though, that putting it in the statement at this time provide clarification.  People will look at it, and they'll read it, and they'll go, So I think it's better to talk about it in the press conference, talk about the statement in In terms of language, I think paragraph 5 in alternative B-the concept is really important.  Why is the SEP projection for the funds rate 2016? setting for essentially what we're saying. will actually 'What is this all about?' it in the minutes, talk about it in speeches, and then try to craft language in subsequent meetings that drives this home a little bit more.

'at its coming meetings' is perfectly I think we will definitely want to put that in.  It would be weird if we weren't going meetings, so I don't see that as controversial.  It's consistent with Finally, in terms of the bracketed language, accurate, so to consider it at coming following the framework that the Chairman laid out at the June press conference.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

close decision. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  Thank you for an exceptionally good discussion of what really and truly is a

September 17-18, 2013

Let me defend that preference.  Let me begin by addressing the going back on our word or abandoning our framework or Let me just say that, first of all, everybody I heard around the table and I consulted with before the meeting on a bilateral basis-not everybody was thrilled I laid out in June, and Dan did us the favor what it was. I support alternative B. question of whether or not we are anything like that. everybody ex ante when we did what we did in June, but I think, at this point, everybody around the table is willing to live with and adhere to the framework that of reminding us reinforcing that we are remaining within that at the press conference.  Just looking at the language paragraph 3 of alternative B, the beginning of that, we say we take note of 'the and labor market conditions since it began its asset purchase That condition of I think that we do have mechanisms for framework, besides my obvious opportunity here, first in improvement in economic activity program,' which is 'consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy.' strikes me as a pretty upbeat description, a basic outlook that is for a pickup of growth as fiscal drag is reduced and continuing improvement in labor market conditions.  And I do have planned, in my opening remarks today, to spend some time on the cumulative improvement we've seen in the labor market, which, obviously, lays the predicate for our meeting the substantial improvement in the labor market.

that in paragraph 4 of alternative B, there's a key sentence that when to moderate . . . ,' not 'In judging whether to moderate . . . ,' or 'In a presumption there that moderation will take place.  It's I take it, in listening to people around the table, that the working majority 'at its coming meetings.'  If that's not the case, we'll have an that in a second.  But obviously, beyond being factual, as the Vice Second, I would note starts 'In judging judging if to moderate . . . ,' so there's just a matter of timing. is in favor of including the phrase opportunity to talk about

September 17-18, 2013

a hint that coming are still on the table.  And as I mentioned yesterday, I will be clear that even October is 'whether incoming information continues to support.'  In the bar, but that we're still well within the answers are all structured around the June framework. Chairman suggested, I think he also knows that it's going to be a bit of meetings on the table, notwithstanding that there's no scheduled press conference.  That sentence also says that the Committee will be assessing other words, it's been supporting.  Does it continue to support 'the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement'?  So I don't know how we could be any stronger in saying that we've decided, at this meeting, that we don't quite meet framework; my of that said, there were a couple of elements of the June framework that are year' is later this year; it doesn't necessarily mean September. 'asset purchases are not on a preset course.' are still tied to the data.  In short, I think the public will understand, most of them, that June framework and that we're exercising the conditionality clause, if you Again, all important.  First, 'later this Second, and more important, as in the statement, The conditionality, the data dependence, is, I think, really important, and the strength of this program was that it was tied to progress in the economy-that was the main innovation over the previous asset purchase programs.  And we want to ensure that people understand that asset purchases we're still within the will, in that framework.

case for taking no action?  I see three basic arguments.  The first is, remember that the conditionality is that the data are consistent with our underlying Lockhart, didn't you say 'persistently ambiguous'?-and do raise some significant increase in interest rates, and that continued since July, It has been Now, what's the argument expectations of growth, labor market conditions, and inflation.  I think the recent data are pretty ambiguous-President questions.  There is a very notwithstanding the fact that there weren't any more communication events.

September 17-18, 2013

meeting, and, nevertheless, rates continued to drift up.  That we've seen some be important to understand, particularly in housing but also in other to be.  So the increase in interest rates, I I will note and one that is noted in the statement. remarkably quiet since the previous said, mortgage rates appear to have stabilized, at least for the moment, and impact on housing.  It'll interest-sensitive areas, how big that effect is likely think, is an important development, one that won't emphasize but which clearly will be a subtext in more than accounted This is not to say that we should draw a strong conclusion that we we may want to see a little bit concluding that the progress we saw earlier in the year and since pace. In addition, something which I talking about labor market conditions, is that the last couple of labor market reports were pretty weak-109,000 jobs in July, an unemployment decline in August that was for by declining participation. are off track, but rather that, given the noisiness of these data, more information before September is being continued at about the earlier

inflation has picked up slightly as the temporary factors ask whether or not going to be approaching target anytime soon.  I de-emphasize little bit. Also, while it is true that recent unwound, as R&amp;S predicted, inflation is quite low, and one could arguably there's any basis for thinking it's that because, obviously, that's not something we're going to know much about in the next month or two, but it does condition the overall outlook a also won't put much weight on fiscal uncertainty, but I think that it is a considerationearlier this and the events that are coming up for October.  To summarize all of that, as I think are we doing this now?  So, as I said before, you can defend tapering, I guess the clearest case was made by President Plosser, who said, 'Well, there's been some I both the uncertainty about the total impact of the fiscal restraint that was undertaken year Governor Tarullo mentioned, the SEP downgraded 2013 and 2014 growth-again, raising a tough question about, why and

September 17-18, 2013

that we've seen any the first argument is that the recent data really change, but it's well within the bounds of noise, and we don't really know real change.'  And I think that's fair.  But before taking this step, I would like to have a little bit more confirmation that progress is continuing.  So are somewhat ambiguous, and additional information could be helpful.

There are some issues of signaling and It's a very delicate balance, but, to the extent that markets believe thatkeeps coming up-we are determined to get out of this program as fast guidance, but also for the I'll come back to that issue in just a The second argument has also been addressed. communication here. and the word 'hell-bent' as possible, no matter what happens, that's bad not only for our rate general perception of our willingness to be aggressive in supporting economic recovery.  And I think a little bit of a surprise could actually make that point. second.

argument is risk analysis, and it's been talked about.  There is some I think, Governor Tarullo said-and I mentioned yesterday, it may not be a we will very much regret having taken an action today and reputational damage, I would assume.  On the other hand, if conditions as they've been recently, then we're okay, basically, in either case at the next couple of meetings. My third basic chance that the actual act of tapering will flip a switch-as, cause rates to move up meaningfully more.  That is a pretty significant risk, given how much they've already risen and how quickly.  In addition, as high probability, but, given the recent data, there's some chance that things will worsen notably in the next few months, in which case we will have a lot of continue to be more or less because we'd be able to start the taper process of that, I do recognize that if I had any illusion that I could predict I hereby for sure exactly how the Now, having said all the market response to communication, it has been completely shattered.  [Laughter]  So adopt the Rubin view that markets will fluctuate, and I do not know

September 17-18, 2013

I will do my best to and that we are going to begin the process of I recognize that there is some risk there, and you just have to make the best guess that you markets will deal with the fact that we will be surprising them somewhat. clarify that we remain within the June framework, winding down the program, contingent on the data confirming the basic contours of our outlook. But can.

I would support alternative B at this meeting.  Let me say gathered from the discussion.  There's a lot of interest, I think, in a while.  It's a really good in particular, the inflation threshold, the post-liftoff period, and, as guidance on the asset purchases would be spare time, can take a look and in October at how guidance, which would be a very useful offset if we are able to taper, is, not only is it virtually it's also very likely that we will have Board nominations.  There will be, at that point, a greater sense of certainty about the doesn't mean we couldn't also reduce purchases in October; I'm a complementary move, I think we ought to be carefully at our guidance in October. So those are the reasons that one other thing, which I strengthening our forward guidance, which I've been supporting for idea.  People have noted, Governor Stein suggested, maybe even more worthwhile.  I would suggest that we and the staff, in its copious maybe do some preliminary consultation so that we can look very seriously we might strengthen the because it would, again, separate, to some extent, these two tools.  So I think that's certainly worth pursuing.  One reason to do it in October as opposed to today certain that the leadership uncertainty will be resolved, but a couple of composition of the Committee going forward.  Obviously, people in confirmation mode are not going to be making speeches advocating particular policies, but, nevertheless, the backgrounds and records of the individuals would provide some information to the markets.  So that's what I'd like to propose.  That prepared to do that.  But, as a backstop or even as looking very

September 17-18, 2013

go through the language really quickly here.  Let me see and make sure that I heard nothing at all about paragraph 1 of alternative B, the word 'further' is in brackets.  Remember, the word 'further' guess I would suggest that we take off the brackets and just leave Let me just there aren't any particular concerns. description of the economy.  The was used in July.  So I 'further' there.

are capital as well as the credit.  Nevertheless, I do think that, certainly, the higher mortgage rates, which we are looking at, and we do also want to see Second, I take President Fisher's observations about financial conditions.  There many dimensions of financial conditions.  They include the cost of availability of are cited in paragraph 1 of alternative B, are one of the things that want to understand the implications.  But it's not just housing-I think we what's happening to other interest-sensitive factors.

No one mentioned paragraph 2 of alternative B, either.

I make a slight suggestion so that we're more MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, may accurate?

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sure.

I would have that section just say 'But some tightening of financial pace of improvement I don't think you take anything away.  I think, again, market what we're talking about, because they're seeing tightening in certain financial conditions has occurred in recent MR. FISHER. conditions has occurred in recent months and, if sustained, could slow the in the economy and labor market.' operators would wonder sectors.  But I think if we just say 'Some tightening of months and, if sustained . . .'-that's literally true.

September 17-18, 2013

It means that whatever tightening there was, even if it was small, is something that 'the large tightening.' CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  But this statement is true, too.  You could say 'the tightening.' could slow the pace of the economy.  It didn't say

If you reject it, fine.  I just wanted to request it. MR. FISHER.  It's a minor change. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.  Are there other suggestions on that or support for that?

I think I like it the way it is. fold my hand.  Thank you. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think I would like to keep it the way it is. MR. FISHER.  I

would also suggest that we keep the CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, I appreciate it.  I 'on net' here that's bracketed.

I was interested-I think it was President Kocherlakota, you suggested the fiscal something I'm perfectly No one commented on that, so I'm assuming that this sentence is okay, so.  [No response] Now, reference in the beginning of paragraph 3.  This is a pretty strong introductory statement.  It basically has a theory, which says that the thing that's holding us back is 'federal fiscal retrenchment'-otherwise, we would see a stronger economy.  That's comfortable with.  And it does take a somewhat more optimistic tone about the underlying strength of the economy. but if anyone is concerned about it, they should say

Let me just note, in case there was any confusion, that the introduction of at the end of paragraph 3 of alternative paragraph.  So there's All right. 'stronger economic recovery' and 'inflation, over time' B is simply moving the phrase that was crossed out at the beginning of the no substantive change intended by that movement.

September 17-18, 2013

paragraph 4, I think that the sense of the discussion was to include 'at its coming and that no one seemed to have any concerns about the rest of the language.  If there so.  [No response] In meetings,' are concerns, please say

My sense of the discussion was that we way, but I do think that the language is why I think it's promising.  The sentence that says 'In determining how policy, the Committee will also about the language in paragraph 5 of alternative A is explicitly says that, after we get to 6½ percent, we're going to start looking at other Alternative B is actually a little bit vague on that particular point. Finally, there were a couple of comments about paragraph 5.  In particular, President Williams noted some language on the post-liftoff plans. ought to do this in October in a more systematic promising.  Let me say long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary consider other information,' actually could apply to the threshold as well as the period after reaching the threshold.  And what's nice that it very stuff.

I think-and I'll ask Governor Yellen for her agreement-that most people felt it the permission of the Committee to guess, would be that the going to have to be very Committee, but Any objections to my saying something like that? Finally, would be better to leave this sentence off for now, the last sentence in paragraph 5 of alternative B, because it's a complicated idea.  However, I would like explain why the SEP has this property.  And the main reason, I Committee believes that it can achieve maximum employment and price stability, as the SEP suggests, by 2016.  But in order to do that, given headwinds, we're patient with our rate policy.  That's the expectation of not everyone on the certainly the majority of the Committee. President Kocherlakota.

I don't have an objection.  I'm very sympathetic to that I will say that I have tried myself to explain this issue to MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. description of the Committee's views.

MR. EVANS.  Mr. Chairman?

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.

I could just say this:  One reaction to that would be to try to get the exactly right.  Another reaction would be to just repeat it many times.  One of the your NBER commentary was that you followed, basically, the plain English of MR. EVANS.  If wording advantages of what you'd said in the press conference, but by repeating it over and over again, I think it sinks in.

you talking about this last sentence? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are difficult concept, I wouldn't be stymied good, then repeating itMR. EVANS.  As an example.  When we get to a by the fact that it's a little hard to understand.  If the plain English is

a banker's friend.  [Laughter]  All right.  Any other comments or questions?  Again, I really end, I think that, while it's worth doing this and my hope is that it will send a signal of our our objectives, I'm a little more optimistic President Fisher. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes, I've discovered that elegant variation is not really central do appreciate people's openness and thoughtfulness in this discussion.  It's a difficult decision. In the commitment to doing what's necessary to achieve than Governor Powell about this.  I think that we are, ultimately, going to converge to the same path, more or less, that we would be on if we took a small action today, but of course, that remains to be seen.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Maybe that was the reason.

I've heard MR. FISHER.  Yes, it was a very impressive statement.  And it's the only time four individuals use the term 'hell-bent' in eight years.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I think this was a really good discussion. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.

It was very helpful.  I asked yesterday for people to think year.  And I think we kind of backed into a decent plan for the rest of the year, particularly focusing on our guidance in CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. not only about today, but also about the rest of the what might be October and, of course, responding to the data in terms of the asset purchases.
