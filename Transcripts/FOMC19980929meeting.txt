Transcript  f  the ederal pen Market  Committee  Meeting  of

o F O September  29,  1998

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. We  are  getting  nder  way a  bit  arly, t   am sure  we u e bu I will se  the  time  productively. uld somebody like  o  move approval f  the  minutes?  I  want u Wo t o to  call our  attention   the  addition  f  reference   the inutes o  our ecent elephone y to o a in m t r t conference.    trust l f  you have  looked  at  it  nd that  here  s o  objection   the  way it s I al o a t i n to i worded.

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Move  approval.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without  objection.

The second  item  on the genda  involves   continuation  iscussions 've  had  on a a ofd we the  issue f  disclosure.   its  emorandum,  the taff  innowed down our  earlier nsiderations, o In m s w co and the  options  ow  seem fairly raightforward.  ere  is o  urgency  to  implement  any  of hem, n st Th n t and I  think e should ontinue ur  discussions til  e can  reach  a  consensus f ome sort. w c o un w o s This  is ot  strictly atter  or  Committee  vote.  Whatever  we do,  including  othing,  t  s n a  m f a n i i important  hat  t  eflect  consensus s  differentiated  m a  majority  ote.  I  don't  hink  change t i r a a fro v t a in  our  procedures  hould e  made by a  majority  ote  because nce  such  a change  is ade it  s s b v o m i very  difficult    backtrack.  s a  result,  y  change  should e something ith  which everyone to A an b w feels easonably  omfortable.  aving said hat,  ould  somebody like o  respond  to  the r c H t w t memorandum,  which sets ut  the  issues  n  a way that oes  not  seem to  require    staff iefing? o i d a br President  oenig. H

MR.  HOENIG. Mr.  Chairman,  after  eading he emo  and  participating everal r t m in  s discussions   this uestion,  y inclination    to  go with  Option  1.  With regard o  that  ption, of q m is t o the  simpler  nd  more straightforward   language,  he  better.  ndeed,    would  simplify  he a the t I I t

language ven  further.  or  the  symmetric  alternative, uld say  something ike  in  view  of he e F I  wo l " t currently ailable  vidence,  he  Committee  believes  hat evelopments re qually ikely av t t d a e l to warrant    decrease r  an  increase  n  the ederal  unds ate." f he  decision  ere  for   tilt, a o i f f r I t w a I would  have  the  sentence  ay  "in  view  of he urrently ailable idence,  he ommittee s t c av v t C believes  hat  evelopments re  more likely   warrant   decrease/increase n  an  increase/ t d a to a tha decrease  n  the  federal  unds ate."    think hat ording  is nderstandable d  straightforward. i f r I t w u an

I  also ould  like o  see  the inutes eleased  ven  sooner han s ontemplated  n  this w t m r e t i c i memo  if  hat  s  physically ssible. hat's  ecause,  s  I  said he  last  ime  we discussed  his t i po T b a t t t matter,  he  minutes rovide ontext  or he ommittee's ecision.  f e are  going  to  be  more t p c f t C d I w transparent,  oner s  better an  later   that  egard.   know there re  physical  imitations so i th in r I a l involved n  the  production  f he  minutes. i o t

In  sum,  my preference  ould  be  to  put impler  anguage n  the irective,  lease  t w s l i d re i promptly,  nd  then ublish he inutes  as  soon  as  we can  to  give  context  o  our  decision. a p t m t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I  gather y  implication at  e have  concluded n  our b th w i previous  iscussions at  ariations    wording  to  describe  iffering  grees f ilt ve  not d th v in d de o t ha served  us  very  well. s you know,  in  the ast e have  had  hard ilts,  dium  tilts,  lted  lts, A p w t me ti ti biased ilts,  d  who knows what  else! t an

MR. HOENIG. We  need  an  interpreter  figure  ut  what  all hat  eans. That  is rue to o t m t even  for s,  let lone he ublic. u a t p

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  uynn. G

MR. GUYNN. Mr.  Chairman,  I hare om  Hoenig's iews  pretty  uch down the s T v m line.    come to  this,   I  said ast  ime, ith  a  sense hat he ore information  e can  put ut I as l t w t t m w o promptly,  he  better. e more quickly arkets eact, e  more the  policy  ncertainty emiums t Th m r th u pr

that  ight  otherwise  et  built  nto  arkets re educed.  So,  I  would  favor oth  announcing he m g i m a r b t tilt mediately  fter  ach  meeting  and  releasing e  minutes  sooner. im a e th

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Tom, did  you also ay  you favored eleasing e ilt s r th t immediately?

MR.  HOENIG. Yes,  I  would  be  in  favor  f eleasing   romptly fter  ach  meeting o r itp a e with  the impler,  learer  anguage. s c l

MR.  GUYNN. I  think  t  s  mportant  s  we continue  his  iscussion   be  sure  that  e i i i a t d to w all  have  the ame objectives.    my  view,  the  first d  foremost bjective  o  make our  intent s In an o ist clear.    think  he taff es  a  really  ice ob n  page  2 of  their  emo  where  they xpress heir I t s do n j o m e t sense  of hat  we mean by the  tilt,  mely  that t eflects  e ommittee's hinking  bout  the w na i r th C t a balance  of isks.  hat  is y  current  nderstanding  f he rimary eason or he  tilt nguage.  I r T m u o t p r f t la believe  he  secondary ntent  s  to ontinue he  practice  f  giving he hairman  the  authority t i i c t o t C to act  for he  Committee  in  extraordinary  rcumstances.    assume  those re  the wo  things e are t ci I a t w trying  o  accomplish. t

I  do  not  think hat nnouncing he ilt uld  have  a negative  ffect  n the ommittee's t a t t wo e o C discussion,  though hat s n issue  aised  n  the taff  emo.  In  fact,  would argue  that  t ight al t i a r i s m I i m even  strengthen  he  discussion   that hose ho favored ction t  a  meeting  when none  was t in t w a a taken  would  at  least  ave  the enefit  f he  tilt ing  announced  immediately,  ith  whatever h b o t be w effect  hat  ight  have  on the arket.  I  also m satisfied  at  ed  watchers nd  others ho pay t m m a th F a w attention   the  tilt e  smart nough to  realize at ircumstances  ay change  as  events nfold to ar e th c m u after   meeting.  Thus,  they ill ot xpect  our ext  action  lways  to  be  in  the irection   a  tilt. a w n e n a d of

I  also hare om  Hoenig's iew  on releasing e  minutes.  I  assume  that  e should  be s T v th w able o  publish  he inutes ooner han  a  few days  before he  next eeting  as  suggested  n  the t t m s t t m i staff mo.  Since  the inutes  elaborate  n  the easoning  ehind he  tilt,  hink  he  sooner e me m o r b t I  t t w

release  hem, he  better  e are  served.   also hare om's  preference  or impler  anguage n the t t w I s T f s l o tilt,  d  I  would incorporate e impler anguage n  the  staff  emo  with  the hanges  that  om an th s l i m c T suggested.    also ould  reword  the ead entence  o  indicate  hat  he  Committee  seeks onditions I w l s t t t c in  reserve  arkets hat re  consistent th  its  andate  to  foster  onger-run  rice  tability m t a wi m l p s and sustained  conomic  growth. e

Finally,  wonder  whether  we should  consider  ropping he ast  entence  f  the I d t l s o operating  aragraph,  hich references  rowth  in  M2  and  M3.  That  sentence ay suggest  hat p w g m t the  Committee has  those ggregates  s  a  policy bjective,  d  I  question  hether t  s elevant  n a a o an w i i r i terms  of he ay we currently  onduct olicy. owever,  this  ay be an issue  hat  e don't  ant t w c p H m t w w to  open  at his  ime. t t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. As a  central  ank, e should t  least  ecognize  hat  2 b w a r t M and  M3  exist,   matter hat  we do  with  them.  [Laughter] no w

MR.  GUYNN. I  accept hat!  hank you,  Mr.  Chairman. t T

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  inehan. M

MS.  MINEHAN. I  am very  much  in  agreement  with  Presidents enig  and  Guynn.  I Ho favor ption  1, rompt  release  fter    meeting,  nd  simpler  anguage. ,  too, ried  o  draft O p a a a l I t t language hat ould underscore  he oncept  of  risk  o  which both  Tom  and  Jack  seemed to e t w t c t b referring.  also elieve  hat  he  minutes  should e  released  ooner han  2 or  3 days  before  he I b t t b s t t next  meeting,  f  hat  s  at ll ossible. i t i a p

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  arry. P

MR.  PARRY. I  basically pport hat  the  three residents o preceded e said su w P wh m about  making a  prompt  announcement, nd  I  would release  he perational ragraph hen we a t o pa w change  the ilt.  have  to  say  that    find he anguage n ption  2  relating   the  tilt    be t I I t l i O to to somewhat preferable   that  n  Option  1, hough  both  certainly e etter an  what  we have to i t ar b th

today.  Option  2,  it eems  to  me,  captures  he  essential  ement f symmetry  in  that  t  efers  o s t el o a i r t the  likelihood at  e will ove  policy  n  one  direction ther  han  the  other,  nd  I  think hat s th w m i ra t a t i highly esirable.  hat I  like bout  Option  1  is he  reference   the  long-run  oals. o,  some d W a t to g S combination f  Options  1  and  2 would  be  my  preference. o

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  cTeer. M

MR.  MCTEER. Just o  play evil's  vocate,    would  like o  suggest hat  e'd  be t d ad I t t w better  ff ot ormally  oting n a  tilt. erefore,  e wouldn't  ave  the  decision  o ake on o n f v o Th w h t m how to  release  hat ote.  I  understand  hat aving  the ilt    an option ay help ith  consensus t v t h t as m w building  nd  arriving   a  decision  uring ny  given  meeting,  ut  we can  get he ense f  where a at d a b t s o we as  a group  are  leaning  ithout  ecessarily ting n  it. e  would run  fewer  risks  f reating w n vo o W o c embarrassing  ituations  ere we were  getting  eady  to  zig ut  had  said t he  previous  eeting s wh r b a t m that  e were more likely  o  zag. I  think  here ould  be  a  greater  egree f reedom  for he w t t w d o f t Committee  if e did  not  have  a  formal  tilt t ust  istened   each  other  nd  knew which  way w bu j l to a we were leaning  ithout aving  to  take   vote. w h a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Rivlin.

MS. RIVLIN.  I  agree  with  Option  1  as  amended by  Tom  Hoenig.  I  thought he taff t s draft  as a  quite  ood breakthrough  n  terms  of  added  clarity d  straightforwardness,    Tom w g i an and has  made it    bit  etter.  suspect  hat hat  will appen  if  e know we are  announcing he ilt a b I t w h w t t is that e will e  less ikely  o  have  one.  We  may,  if  here s   considerable gree  of ncertainty, w b l t t i a de u take  refuge  n  a  no  tilt rective,   that eems  appropriate    me.  The only eason or aving  a i di but s to r f h tilt  hat e want  to  send  a  signal bout  which way we are  leaning.  hen  we are  sure nough ist w a W e of  that  ignal,  e ought  to  say  so. We  don't  eed  to  signal  urselves;  need  to  signal s w n o we somebody else.  So,  it hould e  a  public atter.    also hink t ould  be  desirable   get  the s b m I t i w to

minutes  out  sooner f  e could.  But  the mportant  reakthrough  s traightforward  nguage n i w i b i s la o the  tilt  d announcing  it mmediately. an i

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Meyer.

MR.  MEYER. I  continue o avor mmediate  announcement  of  the ilt.  thought om t f i t I T Hoenig and  Jack  Guynn presented  he  arguments xtremely ell, nd  I elieve  om  improved t e w a b T the  draft  anguage   little.  ecognize  hat  here  s  some danger hat  n  immediate  announcement l a I  r t t i t a could  reduce he  use  of  the ilt. wever,  if  e are isciplined, can avoid  that  nd  honestly t t Ho w d we a communicate  to  the  public xactly  ow we assess  he  risks  oing orward.  That  is  what  the ilt e h t g f t does.  Releasing  he inutes  more quickly  ould be  a  further nstructive  ep oward t m w co st t incremental  ransparency,  d  I  think oing  that  ould  be  a  good idea. t an d w

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  roaddus. B

MR.  BROADDUS. Mr.  Chairman,   continue  o  believe  hat  he  more  information I t t t and  the learer  he nformation,  e  better.  o,  I  agree ith  the ajority  ere.  I  like  he anguage c t i th S w m h t l of  Option  1, nd  I  think  om  Hoenig has  improved  it. ith Tom's  changes, hat  ption trikes a T W t o s me as  a  huge  improvement  over  what we have  now.  I  would  release  he irective mediately t d im and  release  he  minutes s  early s  possible. t a a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  oehne. B

MR. BOEHNE. I  agree  with  the impler  anguage. ,  oo,  hink hat om  has s l I t t t T improved  it,  nd  I  would go with hat. hile  I  realize at t's  fficult  be against  roviding a t W th i di to p more information, ontinue o  have  some problems  with  immediate  release  f  the  tilt.    am for I  c t o I more information  s  a eneral atter,  ut  I  believe  he  practical tcome  of  prompt  release  f a g m b t ou o our  decision  n the  tilt uld  be  less se  of  it. onetary  policy  oes  not ake lace n  a  vacuum. o wo u M d t p i It  takes  lace n  a  wider ocial  nd  political  vironment. n  that nvironment,  t s lmost p i s a en I e i i a always  easier  o  lower nterest  tes  han t s o aise  hem.  If e are lanning  o  raise  nterest t i ra t i i t r t w p t i

rates,  e may as  well  get  a  real ang  for he uck  and  actually   it. f e say  we might  raise w b t b do I w them and  then  fail  o  do so, e are oing  to  get he  inevitable nouncement  effect  nd the t w g t an a associated iticism r oing  it. here  will e  a further nnouncement"  effect  ater  hen cr fo d T b "a l w nothing appens.  I  think e will o through hat xercise    few  times nd  conclude hat  t  eally h w g t e a a t i r is ot  worth  doing.  Not acting  n  the  direction   a  tilt y also rode  our  credibility.  tilt n i of ma e The may be  useful or ur  internal liberations,    we would be  using t  ess nd  adopting f o de but i l a symmetric  directives re frequently. ,  I  have  real oubts hat  his  ind  of  disclosure uld mo So d t t k wo actually ntribute   clarity. d I  therefore  ave  misgivings  bout  moving in  the  direction co to An h a where the ajority  pinion  appears o  be  going. m o t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  tern. S

MR.  STERN. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. I  certainly  vor arlier lease  f he fa e e o t minutes  and  clarifying  e  language ith  regard o  the  tilt   the  lack hereof.  ike  Bob Parry, th w t or t L I have  a  mild  preference  or omething ike  ption  2,  but  there  oesn't em to  be  a  huge f s l O d se difference tween  the wo versions  s  I  read  them. be t a

I  share d Boehne's eservations  out  the  immediate elease  f  the ecision  n the E r ab r o d o tilt. storically,  eems to  me that  t as  been  a  very  noisy ignal  ecause e frequently ve Hi it s i h s b w ha had a tilt   changed  the ilt d  nothing ollowed. hat  gives e some pause.  I'm ot  sure e or t an f T m n w are  going  to  have  the ntended esults om  that ind  of elease,   least  t his  oint n  time.  So, i r fr k r at a t p i I'm  not  in  favor f mmediate elease  t east  or ow, and  I  would prefer  o  hold  off aking a o i r a l f n t m decision.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Ferguson.

MR.  FERGUSON. I  am  with  what  seems  to  be  the rowing  majority  ere,  ut g h b I recognize hat  here  re  counter rguments.  I'm  in  favor f  immediately  eleasing e ilt inly t t a a o r th t ma because  it's uestion  f  honesty. f    consensus as  emerged in  the ommittee that  ays  the a  q o I a h C s

risks  ave  moved in  a  certain rection  nd  therefore  olicy  ay follow,  think t s seful o h di a p m I i i u t inform  the  market.  We  are ow in  a  posture  here  we do  not elease  he  tilt d  we end  up n w r t an having  a umber of  people  trying  o  interpret  r  speeches nd  our esponses  o  questions   a n t ou a r t in way that ay not  conform  with  our hinking.    think eleasing e ilt omptly ill ive  us  a m t I r th t pr w g chance  to  be  much  clearer th  the arket,  o  signal  ith  one  voice s  opposed  to  potentially wi m t w a 19 voices,  nd  to e certain  hat f  e have  reached   consensus,  e will ell  he arket  what  the a b t i w a w t t m consensus  is.

I  also ould  be  happy  to  encourage he arlier lease  f  the inutes n  the  sense hat w t e re o m i t they  provide   fuller ntext or ur  decisions.  s to  the  language,    have  a slight eference  or a co f o A I pr f Option  1  as  amended by  Tom  Hoenig, ut  I  can  support  ption  2 as  well. b O

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  oole. P

MR.  POOLE. I,  too,  ike  ption  1, ut  I  would  prefer  he ilt nguage rom Option  2. l O b t t la f I  think hat  he arliest  ssible  elease  f  the inutes,  onsistent th  their  eing  written  learly t t e po r o m c wi b c and  informatively,  a  good idea.   would like  o  add  that    cannot magine   better me  to is I t I i a ti introduce  hese ew procedures han  right  ow, given  the  other hings  hat  re oing  on. t n t n t t a g

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Gramlich.

MR. GRAMLICH. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. First, m for eleasing e  tilt I  a r th sentence r  the  entire  irective ragraph romptly  after  he eeting  and  the inutes  as  soon  as o d pa p t m m possible  hereafter.    the anguage f he  directive ragraph,    am for ption  1. et  me point t On l o t pa I O L out  one  difference tween  Option  1  and  Option  2;  Option  1 tates  he ommittee's oals n  the be s t C g i first ntence nd  goes  on to  say  what  the ommittee did; ption  2  reverses  hat  rder. owever se a C O t o H we describe  he  tilt,  ould like o  preserve  hat  spect f  Option  1. That  is,    would  state  he t I  w t t a o I t goals irst d  then  indicate at we did. f an wh

I  agree ith  Bill oole  that  e should dopt  these hanges  today,  lthough hey ay w P w a c a t m make us  a little  ss ggressive  bout hanging  the irective  nguage.   agree ith  what  Tom le a a c d la I w Hoenig said,  ut  unlike ob McTeer,  I  would  like  o  retain  he  tilt  he irective. e thing b B t t int d On I have  been  worried bout, nd  I  have  said o  in  the ast,  s hat he ay we make policy  ould a a s p i t t w c allow  us  to  get oo  rigid  n  the ederal  unds ate. f  e keep  the ilt, can  be  a little  ss igid, t o f f r I w t we le r and  I  would  like  o  retain  t  or hat  eason. t i f t r

On a  last  oint egarding  ur  credibility t  d Boehne made and  Gary Stern p r o tha E seconded,    have  been  impressed ince   have  been  here  at ow  short  eople's mories are.  Six I s I h p me weeks is  a  fairly ng  interval   terms f  monetary  events,  nd  there s  great  eal f lo in o a i a d o speculation  bout hat  we are  going  to  do  today nd not  too uch is emembered  about  where a w a m r we were six  weeks ago.  I'm  not  too  worried bout he redibility ue ecause f e change  our a t c iss b i w position  r  change  our  minds  I  think hat  ould be  viewed  in  the ontext f  whether t s  good o t w c o i i a thing o  do  in  light  f he  most  recent vents.  I  don't  hink  e would lose ny  credibility.   I t o t e t w a So, am inclined  o  downplay that  rgument. t a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice  Chair.

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman,  I  think t ight  be  worth i m thinking  bout  why we do  what  we do before e change  it.  ne of  the ealities hat  y a w O r i t b releasing  he inutes  of  meeting  two days  after  he ollowing  eeting,  he ecision  n the  tilt t m a t f m t d o at he  earlier eting  may be  interesting   it  s  no  longer  ery  important.  e  already  ave t me but i v W h decided  either  o ase  or  not o  ease  or  to  tighten   not o ighten  t he eeting hat  ook lace t e t or t t a t m t t p two days  before. hy  have  we thought hat  se  of he ilt s  served ur  cause ell?  In  my W t u t t ha o w view  it as  helped s  to  focus  on what  we want  to  do  in  terms  of uiding ur  policy  etween  one h u g o b meeting  and  the ext r  at east  n  terms  of   longer-term  iew  of here  we are eaded.  I  think n o l i a v w h that  as  served s  very ell. h u w

If e decide o  release  he  minutes arlier,  ich in  and  of tself   robably   good w t t e wh i isp a idea,  y analysis  f  the ollective  ychology  of his  roup  is hat  n  fact,  s  Alice ivlin m o c ps t g t i a R suggested,  e will ot  do a  whole  lot f  "tilting."  e  reason s hat  f  e are  going  to  announce w n o Th i t i w the  tilt ther  ight  way or  shortly fore he  next eeting y  releasing e  minutes arly,  e ei r a be t m b th e w will reate    difficult  nundrum for his  entral  ank.  Central ankers re  supposed  to  be c a co t c b b a believers   price  tability.  en if e are  symmetric  in  our  approach  to nflation,  I  think in s Ev w i as many of  us  are,  n  the ense hat e are  opposed  to  both  inflation d  deflation,  e ublic i s t w an th p believes  hat  entral  ankers re  supposed o  be  inflation  ghters.  e  have  to  remind  them t c b a t fi W every  now  and  then hat e are gainst  eflation so.   can  envision  s  sitting  ound  this  able t w a d al I u ar t saying hat  e ought  to  have  a  directive at  s iased oward  tightening,  d  some of s  would t w th i b t an u then  say  that  e ought  to  go ahead  and  tighten. ut  if  e do  not ant  to  tighten  t  a  meeting, w B w w a then  it ould  be  better t  to nnounce  after  he  meeting hat  e are hinking  bout oing  it ater. w no a t t w t a d l Doing the  latter  uld in  my view  make us  look  a  little  estionable   our udgment r  at  least wo qu in j o in  our  strength  f haracter.  n  the  other  and, f  e are  thinking  f asing ut re  not  sure e o c O h i w o e b a w want  to ase  at  a  given eeting,  eople ould conclude hat hat  s   rather  easonable  hing or e m p w t t i a r t f central  ankers o e  doing.  So,  with  an  early  nnouncement  we would wind  up  in  my  view  of b t b a the  real orld  more likely   tilt ward asing nd  less ikely  o  tilt ward  firming. w to to e a l t o

Even though  I  believe  hat  t  ould  be a  good  idea n  principle    release  he inutes t i w i to t m early,  nd  therefore  don't  eel ery  strongly  bout  whether e announce  the ilt   the  absence a I f v a w t or of  a  tilt ortly  fter    meeting,    think  t  s ikely  hat  ith  such  an  announcement  the se  of   tilt sh a a I i i l t w u a would  become a  fairly re henomenon.  Most of  the  time  when we think hat  conomic ra p t e conditions,  e  financial rkets,  nd  monetary  conditions e  such  that  t ight  be  appropriate th ma a ar i m to  ease onetary  policy  t ome point,  e as  good  central nkers ight  not e  entirely  re  of m a s w ba m b su

the  need  for asing uite et,  o  we would  not  do  it. herefore,  'm ot ure hat  we would e q y s T I n s w accomplish y  changing  our  procedures. b

To summarize,  prompt  announcements  make us  look  like  elievers   transparency; b in that  s  good.  They make us  look  like  e are  sharing  nformation  ith  the merican  people;  hat i w i w A t is  good. But  in  terms  of ctually  erving  he nterests   he  American people ell--and    think a s t i oft w I we have  been  doing  a  phenomenally  good  job n  that  egard,  eaving  ollective  desty  aside--I i r l c mo am not  sure hat    change  in  our  announcement  procedures ould  improve  our  performance. t a w

MR. MOSKOW. Mr.  Chairman,  I  tend  to  agree ith  President ehne and also w Bo President  cDonough. M It s  hard  to rgue  against  ransparency. viously, e all ant  to i a t Ob w w release  s  much information  s  possible.  ut  if  e were  to esign his  ystem  from  the  start, a a B w d t s I cannot  imagine  that  e would design  a system  that  ould  require  s  to ake two  decisions.  ne w w u m O might  be  a decision  o  maintain  n unchanged  policy  nd  the  other   decision  n whether e t a a a o w want  to  tell  he  world  we might  be  tightening   easing ater. ternatively, might  take n t or l Al we a action nd announce  shortly  fter  he  meeting  whether ur  directive cludes  ither  f  those wo a a t o in e o t tilts.  ust  oes  not  seem logical  o  me that s  a  central  ank  we  would  want  to  do  that.  e It j d t a b W have  used  the ilt r ther  urposes,  nd  now we are rying  o  design ome system  around  that t fo o p a t t s history.  e  wouldn't  esign t his  ay if e were  to  start resh nd  didn't ve  to  take  account W d i t w w af a ha of  its  se  in  the  ast. u p

I  believe  hat f  e were  to  agree  to nnounce  the ilt  ome time efore he ext t i w a t ats b t n meeting, he  practical sult  ould  be  that  e would  use  it uch less. ctually, ough,  he t re w w m A th t existing  ystem  seems to  be  working  rather  ell.  We  had unusual ircumstances  t  the  August s w c a meeting  when we changed  to  a  symmetric  directive.  e July inutes,  eleased  hortly  fter  hat Th m r s a t meeting, ndicated  hat e had  had  an upward  bias. n  the  interim, tween  the ugust  meeting i t w I be A

and  the eptember  meeting,  he  Chairman  consulted  ith  us  at ackson  Hole,  and  he S t w J subsequently  nnounced  that he  directive  longer ad  an upward bias. o,  I  think hat,  n the a t no h S t o whole,  our  system  for nnouncing  our  decisions  as  worked  rather  ell  over he  years nd  I  do a h w t a not  see  any  need  to hange  it t his  oint. c a t p

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  ordan. J

MR.  JORDAN. Thank you. With regard o  the inutes,    agree  with  releasing em t m I th as  soon  they  can  be  prepared, en  though  releasing em sooner ill mpose  some burden  on ev th w i the  staff d  on all f  us  who review  and  approve hem. an o t

On the  release  f he  tilt,  ough,    am  persuaded y  a  number of omments today  that o t th I b c if e release  t  mmediately,  e will ot  use  it. herefore,  want  to elease  he  tilt mediately! w i i w n T I r t im [Laughter]  I  am persuaded hat  ver  time  the  costs f aving  a  tilt tweigh  its  enefits   terms t o o h ou b in of  consensus uilding.    have always  thought  hat  f  e have  monetary  policy  hat perates  n a b I t i w t o o price  asis,  e run  into  roblems  in  terms  of nteractions  the arketplace f  e announce  our b w p i in m i w intention   change  interest  tes  n  a  certain  irection er ime.  The markets o  move  on  that to ra i d ov t d kind  of  information,    opposed  to he ay they end o  function  f  e have  a  quantitative as t w t t i w approach  to  implementing olicy. p

With regard o  the  wording  of he  options, ke  ob Parry nd  Ned Gramlich,    like he t t li B a I t way Option  1  begins ith  a  statement  f ur  objectives. garding  the ilt  ntence,  hough,   do w o o Re t se t I not  like  ption  1  because t tates at the ommittee  believes  hat  evelopments  are  more O i s th " C t d likely  o  warrant....etc."  t  immediately tarts   raise  uestions  bout hat developments re t Tha s to q a w a involved r  what  indicators  ashing  ed,  ellow,  r  green  will rigger   action.  t uts ndue o fl r y o t an I p u weight  on  some signal  hat  ay lead o  a  change  in  policy. ption  2  does  not o  that. t m t O d

I  agree  with  Governor  Gramlich's  omment that  he ederal  unds ate  as  tended o  be c t f f r h t too  rigid, t  my sense  has  been  that  he ilt  equently s  been  used  in  lieu f aking a  policy bu t t fr ha o m

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Kelley.

MR. KELLEY. Mr.  Chairman,  when we discussed  his  ssue  arlier,  poke  at  some t i e I  s length gainst  he dea f  early elease  nd  I  still  el he  same. I  would  like  o estate   views a t i o r a fe t t r my briefly,     may, even  though  most  of y concerns lready  ave  been  expressed.  First  f  all, if I m a h o please  ecall  hat  he  Lindsey aper hat  upported ur  earlier scussion  howed that  ver  the r t t p t s o di s o past  12 years,  he ilt   place t he  time  of  each  FOMC t t in a t decision  as in  the  same direction   the w as decision  tself  ly 2.7  percent f  the  time.  In  the ther  7.3  percent  f he ime, he ecision i on 5 o o 4 o t t t d differed  rom  the xisting lt.  hus,  the ilt s  been  nearly erfectly rthless  s  a  predictor f e ti T t ha p wo a of policy ecisions.  Laughter] d [

In  my  view, his  nd  other roblems  give s  three  easons ot  to  change  our t a p u r n announcement  practices,  d  they  provide e with  a  notion f  what  the esults  ould  be  if  e an m o r w w did.  First, is  ecord hows that n  early elease  ver  the ast ecade  would  frequently ve th r s a r o p d ha misled he  general ublic,  hich  is  only oncerned ith  deeds  and  not  the ine uances  of t p w c w f n economic  reasoning.  As a consequence,    am convinced  that ith  early elease  e would I w r w experience    severe oss f redibility t  s  the  lifeblood   our  policy's fectiveness. cond, a l o c ha i of ef Se early  elease  f  an asymmetry  would often e  the quivalent   a  policy  ove that  he r o b e of m t Committee  had  just  ecided ot o  take,  nd  the ommittee could ever  know as  it oted  what d n t a C n v forces  t ight  inadvertently    setting   motion  an  hour  or  so  later  hen the nnouncement  was i m be in w a made. Third,  f  n asymmetry  were in  place t  a  meeting  where the ssues  ere  close, e ery i a a i w th v existence  f  a  publicly  nown  6-  to -week old osition  ould  influence  he  adoption f  a  less o k 8 p c t o than  optimal ew policy. n

As a  consequence  of ll his,  am confident  hat,  fter  eing urned  a  couple f  times, a t I t a b b o the  Committee  would simply  cease  to  employ this  ery  useful  onvention. hat  would be a v c T shame because he  tilt  egitimizes  e  uncertainty at  s requently esent  nd  the  delay hat  s t l th th i f pr a t i frequently  ppropriate,  d  it lso ids aterially   building    consensus. n  sum,  I  can  see  no a an a a m in a I helpful  lements o  an  early elease  egimen  and  many serious  egative  onsequences. e t r r n c

On the  rewording f  the irective,  uth  o  tell    like  he xisting nguage nd  I  would o d tr t I t e la a be  a little  d  to ee  it o. Everyone  who  is nterested  d  needs  to now understands  t erfectly sa s g i an k i p well, nd  more importantly  onstitutes it f  quaint  mericana  that e should herish. a itc a  b o A w c [Laughter]  That  said,    would support   change  if  hat  s he ommittee's ish,  and  either  f he I a t i t C w o t two  wording  options  nd  the  suggested  mendments are  perfectly ceptable  o  me.  Option  1  is a a ac t fine,  ut   think  here s uch  to  be  said or ption  2 because f  its  reater  ontinuity th  the b I t i m f O o g c wi present  ractice.  hank you. p T

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. One of  the hings hat  trikes  about  this  iscussion, t t s me d and  I  must  admit hat    am on both  sides f his  ssue,  s hat    switch ack  and  forth  o  different t I o t i i t I b t sides t  different mes. he reason s hat e are  being ressed  n something hat  e consider a ti T i t w p o t w to  be  of alue o  the arket, amely  that ore information  s etter  han  less. here  also s n v t m n m i b t T i a ethical  ssue  ere,  ne  relating  he ntegrity   his  nstitution,  t learly  n important  ssue i h o tot i oft i tha c isa i that  e need  to  address. oth  of hose onsiderations  ggest hat ore is etter, though e w B t c su t m b al w must  remember that  e  are  not  going  all he ay in roviding  nformation.  f  e went to  the w t w p i I w fullest  tent  n  that  irection,  en  Henry Gonzalez's  pproach f  live  ransmission  his ex i d th a o t oft meeting  obviously ould  be the ost  ethical  nd  most  directly ailable  ource f  information  o w m a av s o t the  market, ut  it lso ould  be  the ost  useless.  o,  let  s  be  careful  bout ow  we weigh  the b a w m S u a h various  lternatives. a

The one  thing hat  truck  e,  which has  not urfaced  n  our  discussion day, s hat t s m s i to i t our  experience  f he  last  everal  ears as  not een  the  same as  our xperience  ver  much o t s y h b e o a longer ime  frame.

MR.  KELLEY. Americana.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. There  does  seem to  be  a  fairly oad onsensus bout br c a the  desirability  better  nd  simpler  anguage. However,  we have  not  yet ome together  n of a l c o some of  the ther ssues;  f   vote  were taken n  those ssues,  think here  ould be  a  majority  n o i i a o i I t w i favor f  doing  something ow, but  there  s till ignificant  nority  n  the ther ide. ith o n i s a  s mi o o s W regard o  the  wording  of he irective,  is  s he irst me  that    have  sensed  the xistence  f t t d th i t f i I e o general greement  though  there emain  some small ifferences. ould  recommend  that  e put a r d I  w w together  anguage hat  eflects,    best e can  judge,  he onsensus f  this  roup  and  revisit  is l t r as w t c o g th

matter  t  a  later eting. e  can  then  make a  change, nd  I  think  e will e  ready o  do so  in a me W a w b t part ecause  we have  wrestled  ith  this  ssue or   long  period f  time. b w i f a o

There  are wo quite ifferent sclosure sues.  ne is  that f iving hanges  in  the  tilt t d di is O o g c the  same status  s  changes  in  the  funds ate  ith  respect  o hen  they re  announced.  The a r w t w a second, hich as  I  see  it ay  be  viewed  as  independent  f he irst,   hen to  publish  he w m o t f isw t minutes.  I ave  a  certain  ympathy  for he iews  of  the ice  Chair n the  latter. ften ave h s t v V o I  o h wondered what  we would gain  by  releasing e  minutes  a  week earlier an he  current  chedule th th t s if he  information  n  the  tilt  s already ut.  I  grant hat  f  he ilt  ot nnounced  shortly  fter t o wa o t i t t isn a a the  meeting,  hen  moving up the ublication   the  minutes learly  as  the ffect  f eleasing e t p of c h e o r th tilt   that oint. ut  if  he ilt  lready ublished, en  the cceleration   the inutes  strikes at p B t t isa p th a of m me as  something  that robably as  more potential r ischief  han  not.  Remember  that  he p h fo m t t minutes  provide  discussion  f  the arious orces  nd  nuances  and  the ike,  nd  if e were to a o v f a l a w decide  to  publish  hem one  week earlier,  en  why not wo  or  three eeks earlier?  here  has t th t w T been general  greement  within he  Committee that he  contingency  iscussions ntained  n  the a t t d co i minutes  should e  published  nly  after  hose ontingencies   longer ave  relevance.  o,  I  do b o t c no h S think hat he  issues  f hether  we publish  he ilt   the oint f  decisionmaking  nd  when we t t o w t t at p o a release  he  minutes re  separable.  hey are  not ecessarily  ed. t a T n ti

Unless  I  hear n  objection, at  I  would  like o  do  is o  have  Don Kohn construct a wh t t a specific, rmal roposal ased  on today's  iscussion  f he  various  ording  options  nd  Tom fo p b d o t w a Hoenig's mendment.  I  believe  e can  come to  an  agreement  at ur  next  meeting n that  ssue. a w o o i However,  I  do think e should  continue ur iscussion  elating    more prompt  disclosures w o d r to to see  if  e can  narrow  our  differences rther.  e  have  narrowed  them  to  some extent.  n  that w fu W I regard,    would  like  o  suggest hat  he taff view  how, as  they  see  it, anges n  our ractices I t t t s re ch i p would  play  out  in eriods  ther han  when we make decisions  nly  at  meetings nd  are  getting p o t o a

very  little  tside  riticism.   have  been  in  such  a  period or uite   while.

The fact hat e have  not  been  the  subject  f  heavy  criticism r i t B t w o fo a prolonged eriod s  quite  nusual  and  may limit  ur  ability    anticipate  at  we could ace n p i u o to wh f i the  down phase  of  business  ycle f  e change  our isclosure actices.  think t  s ssential a c i w d pr I i i e for  us  to  ake certain  hat f  e decide o ove toward  earlier  lease--a  cision  hat  s  I  said m t i w t m re de t a earlier uld  effectively    irreversible--we  l ave  thought  hrough ow things  ould play wo be wil h t h w out  and  what  the mplications  e.

Turning  to he  next age, e see  another  ay of  looking  t  similar ta. t p w w a da In  the op  panel,  e have  the  10-year wap spreads hat    referred   earlier. t w s t I to The panel  shows  the  10-year ixed  eg f  fixed-floating p against  he f l o a swa t government  bond  for he  same  country--France,  rmany, the  United t Ge Kingdom, and  the  United  States  re  shown.

The bottom  panel,  nfortunately,   oorly abeled;  t hould e  called u isp l i s b "swap-spread preads." hat is  depicted  ere  is  the ifference tween  the s W h d be U.K.  swap spread nd  the rench  swap spread n  blue  and  between  the .K. a F i U swap spread  and  the  German  swap spread n  yellow.  This  is   trade hat  s i a t i based  on what  a  number of eople ave  expected o  occur--the  ong-run p h t l convergence  of he  United  Kingdom  into  he MU. t t E Eventually  hat  s oing t i g to  happen and  this  s  one  way to  take dvantage f hat  xpected vent. i a o t e e Instead  f onverging,  owever,  you can  see  that  he preads ave  tripled o c h t s h since ate ugust. l A

Yet  another ay of  looking  t  the  same data s eflected   the lack w a i r in b and white  charts  hat    have  handed  out.

Yes,  in  sterling.  s hat pread e are  looking t  as  it Iti t s w a widens  out  and  becomes more volatile. on't  eed  to  go  through  all he I  d n t data,  ut  you  can see ssentially  e  same for he .S. 10-year pread nd b e th t U s a the  JP  Morgan emerging  market  bond index.

Finally, . Chairman,  in  the hart n  the  last  age  relating   our  open Mr c o p to market  operations,  u can  see  that  ed unds enerally  ave  traded yo f f g h uneventfully  ince our  last  eeting.  e  did  purchase 7.9  billion  an s y m W $ on outright  asis,  nd  we will ave  to  make more such  purchases  ecause b a h b reserve  eeds  have  been  growing. n

Finally,  had no  foreign  xchange  operations   the  period.  owever, we e in H we are  working  on a  number of ssues  nd  I  would like o  mention  those. i a t One on which we are  working  with  Board  staff   that  f pening ccounts is o o a for he  European  Central ank on our  books  and  trying  o  open  a  Federal t B t Reserve  account  on their  ooks.  It s ot  quite lear  hat, f  nything,  e b i n c w i a w can do with  our  account n their  ooks.  We  don't  now  what  services  hey o b k t will e  offering.  ut  in  the pirit  onhomie and  camaraderie,  are b B s ofb we looking o  open  an account ith  the CB.  There  are  a  number  of  technical t w E

We  also re  working  on a  number  of echnical sues  elated  o  the a t is r t advent f  the  euro  that ave  to  do with  our ayment  facilities    how  we o h p and operate  he  accounts.   am opposed, owever, o  undertaking  ny  planning t I h t a at his  ime  of hanges  in  the nvestment  f  our  reserve  oldings.    would t t c i o h I much  rather  ait  and  see  how markets evelop. here  may be some w d T diversification  ions  or he  management of  our  deutschemark eserves, opt f t r but  I  think  he arkets re  going  to e very ncertain  nd in  any  event he t m a b u a t operational sues  re  consuming  our  time  at  present. is a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Peter,    think  e are  all ware  that    major  trauma n I w a a i world  financial rkets  occurred hen the  Russian  devaluation  nd  debt oratorium  were ma w a m announced.  Since  the ize f  the  Russian conomy is e minimis  relative  he  rest  f  the orld, s o e d tot o w something  fundamentally  ifferent  s going  on. d wa

There  are wo,  not  necessarily  mpeting, iews  as  to  what  occurred.  he  first   hat t co v T ist there as a  general ense hat  he  Asian  contagion round  the orld  was moving into emission, w s t t a w r

though  that  as seen  as  a  gradual rocess. hat  improvement  was perhaps est videnced y the w p T b e b behavior f  the  stripped  rady  spreads,  hich  were fairly able  or  while.  The  realization  at o B w st f a th contagion as still ive nd  well  unwound  a  whole  set f  views  and  expectations at  ent  back w al a o th w a  long  way,  and  that  hock  clearly  apable f xplaining  he ehavior f he inancial rkets. s isc o e t b o t f ma

The second  hypothesis  elates   the resumption hat  n  all ikelihood ere ould be r to p t i l th w a  G-7 bailout  f ussia,  nd  the  implication s that f  ussia as bailed  ut,  verybody  would o R a wa i R w o e be  bailed  ut.  The evident  ailure   that  o  occur  raised  he uestion f  whether ailouts e o f of t t q o b ar back  on the  shelf, d  the  associated rket  disruption flected   abrupt eassessment  f isks, an ma re an r o r which is  captured  n  the  very apid hanges  that ou  mentioned. f  those wo hypotheses,  here i r c y O t w do you  tend  to  lean r  would you consider  hem  not ecessarily   e  mutually xclusive  ut art o t n tob e b p of  the xplanation  or hat  occurred? e f w

MR. FISHER.  I  would fall  n  your  third  ategory,  nd  I'm  glad  you offered  hat i c a t option o  me. As you described  t,  r.  Chairman,  there as some sense f  stabilization t i M w o or calming  in  late  uly hen extreme  movements in  the radys  and  other ecurities  emed to J w B s se moderate.  I  think  here as a  hope at  the ime  that  he MF program  for ussia  announced  at t w t t I R that oint as going  to  tide ussia ver.  No one  thought  hat rogram  was going  to  be  the  last p w R o t p word on Russia,  ut  it as seen  as  a  brief  ign hat  hings  ould  be  held ogether.  ver-optimism b w s t t c t O about  that  ay have  led  some to  double p their ades.  n  any  event,  hen their  onfidence  as m u tr I w c w lost here  esulted,  rough  either  f  the  channels ou are uggesting,  bigger  alloon  o  explode t r th o y s a b t or  to  collapse.  hat  is,  ome nebulous orce n  the  world  of inancial ntagion  as closing  n  or T s f i f co w i the  official ctor  id  not ave  an answer.  Bailout  s  an  answer, ut  it  s  not   plausible e  for se d h i b i a on the  whole  world, s  I  think our  second  alternative  s suggesting.  t oesn't  atter  or a y wa I d m f investors ich of  the  two hypotheses  ou described  s orrect; th  of  them  involve  n extreme wh y i c bo a loss f  confidence.  he market  movement itself  uses nough  losses  o  concentrate e  mind o T ca e t th

and begin  a  delevering  rocess.    must say, s  a side ote o  this,  hat  n  a  meeting n  Basle p I a n t t i i earlier is  onth,  a number of y fellow  central  ankers  discussed  ith  me their  iew  that th m m b w v money does  not  disappear.    disagreed.  hen  markets  delever, ney goes  away and  credit I W mo comes in.  In  the acro sense,  ne  can  look  at  the apanese oney supply; oney really  s m o J m m i disappearing   Japan.

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. May  I  hazard n  observation?    think  ne a I o lesson he  market  learned  rom Russia s hat f  here as any  country he  G-7 wanted  to  keep t f i t i t w t from  going  into ree all,  as Russia  because  of  the otential o-political sequences. f f itw p ge con I believe  here  s  a general iew  that ussian ehavior  t  the fficial  vel  as so  awful  that  t as t i v R b a o le w i w impossible  or he  G-7 to  keep  supporting  uch  a country. hat  reminded  people hat  ven  if  he f t s T t e t G-7 is  trying  o  do  something,  he ost ountry as  to e  reasonably  esponsible   order o  allow t t h c h b r in t the  effort  o  go forward,  uch  less o  assure uccess.  n top  of  the  other  hings hat  ou t m t s O t t y suggested,  r.

On  the  Russian  situation,   east  s  regards eople n  the  First atl a p i District,  elieve  heir  oncern elated  ore to  the  lack f  a  clear  ailout  n  July,  hough  I  think I  b t c r m o b i t opinions  ave  changed  about  whether hat  as a  good or  a  bad  thing. bviously,  eople ave h t w O p h responded  to  the  new stories d  the  rumors  that he ast  ranche  f oney that he MF  put  into an t l t o m t I Russia  quickly  ound  its  ay out  of  Russia.   think  hey ow have  a  better  ense f he isdom f w I t n s o t w displayed  y the  IMF in  not  putting   more money.

I  know money can  disappear  long he  lines  hat  ou  talked bout,  ut  I  do  wonder a t t y a b about  some of  these pread rades.  ho  is n the  other ide f hem? Isn't mebody making s t W o s o t so money on a  bet  that  preads ill iden instead  f  narrowing?  Do we have  any  sense f  who or s w w o o where  that  ight  be? m

MR. FISHER.  I  think ne  has  to  think f  that  n  terms  of he ssuers  r  borrowers f o o i t i o o debt.  That  is,  he ole f he inancial ctor  s  to ake n the inancing  equirements  f  people t r o t f se i t o f r o actually  uilding  actories  d  the ike. o,  the  other  ide ay be  those ho issued  onds  and b f an l S s m w b built  actories  d  did  so  by  borrowing n BBB f an o or  worse  credit  ome time  ago. s

MS. MINEHAN. And they  are  paying ff hose oans ow? o t l n

MR. FISHER.  The borrowers ade money. They borrowed  at  a  good rate  nd  they m a built  ice actories pteen  months  ago. So,  as  I  see  it  uch  borrowers nvolve   fair  umber of n f um s i a n those n the  other ide f  these rades.  t s ot  a  zero  sum outcome  within he  financial ctor  n o s o t I i n t se i that ense. s

MS. MINEHAN. Some of  it ay well  be. m

MR.  FISHER.  Yes,  some people n  the  financial mmunity undoubtedly  re  making i co a money on the  other  ide. s

MS. MINEHAN. These  gains nd  losses  sed  to  be  related  o  trade nd  now they a u t a seem to  be  associated stly  with  speculation. mo

MR.  TRUMAN. They never  involved rade! eriously, ter id  not  mention  the  fact t S Pe d that  he ederal eserve  Bank of  New  York  is  going  to  release  ts  urnover  urvey oday.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

MR.  FISHER.  Yes,  I  agree ith  your  analysis, ough  my point o athy  Minehan w th t C was more limited, mely  that nitially have  to  be  careful  o  separate  he  financial ctor  rom na i we t t se f those ho borrow.  We  might  call  t he  real ector  or he oment.  If e have  had  years nd w i t s f t m w a years f  IPOs and  junk ond  financing, e eal ector  as  already  aken ts  oney  and  invested  t o b th r s h t i m i somehow.

MR. FISHER.

My  impression  f  most  of  the ork that  as  been  done  on  this o w h subject  ver   long  period f ime  is hat olatility   not  shown much trend n  markets  that  re o a o t t v has i a well  developed. f  course,  e may have  episodes  f  high  volatility   that  s hat  Peter as O w o and i w h pointed ut.  This  is  an  episode n  which we observe n extreme  set f ithdrawals  rom  a  large o i a o w f number of  markets.  But  that  oes  not  say  anything,  t  eems  to  me,  about hether e are n a d i s w w o new trend.

MR.  PARRY. I  have  a  question  or eter isher  r  Don Kohn on a somewhat f P F o different  sue. he spread  between 10-year reasury onds  and  the  inflation-indexed  d has is T T b bon narrowed  very  significantly. ink t as  narrowed  to  a  little  er  1  percent.  hat  is mazing I  th i h ov T a when we consider  hat  he  spread resumably  includes  he ffects  f  expected nflation  d t t p t e o i an inflation  sk.  s  that  ue  to  a  lack f iquidity    the  nflation-indexed  d,  and  if  t  s,  hy ri I d o l in i bon i i w hasn't  he arket  been  selling e  10-year ssue  nd  buying  the  indexed ond  in  an  effort t m th i a b to reestablish ore sensible  elationship? a  m r

MR. FISHER.  Let  me first scuss  he  mechanics.  There  clearly  s   lack f upply  in di t i a o s relation   demand,  whether t eflects light  o  quality   a closing  f he  spread rade.    think to i r a  f t or o t t I a  number of  people n  the arket  are ow realizing  at  hey  have  to  shift  heir  asic ssumptions i m n th t t b a about  how to  think bout  the reasury urve elative   other redits.  upply  is  down, demand is a T c r to c S up,  and  they  have  to  think  f he reasury urve n  a  different  y. As I  see  it, ey tarted o t T c i wa th s trading  he  indexed  bond  against  n internal ntal  benchmark  of ow the  normal  10-year ond t a me h b has  traded ver  the  last  ive ears. he typical  rader, hink,  as  a  5-year oving average f o f y T t I  t h m o recent  xperience  n  mind,  if  hey  are  senior  raders.  he  junior  raders  ave  a  1-year olling e i t t T t h r average! Laughter] raders tarted  ut  with  a  presumption f  how to  price  he  inflation-indexed [ T s o o t bonds  against  heir  otion f  a 5-year verage f  a  normal  yield urve, nd  there  as  been  a t n o a o c a h

sudden  shift  n  that  orm,  a  break n  behavior  ecause f he  heightened  emand and  reduced i n i b o t d supply.  I  think hey're ing  to  have  to  work that ut.  Don Kohn may have  a  more profound t go o answer.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. There  is n implicit recast   that  rbitrage   the a fo in a of BLS's  CPI over  a  long-term  eriod.  he question  s hether e should reat  hat mplicit I p T i w w t t i CP forecast  s  a  true eflection   he  view  of he  inflation  sk  n  the arketplace,  ssuming  that  he a r oft t ri i m a t CPI is  measuring  inflation  curately.  s ot  a supply/demand  issue. f    seriously lieve  hat ac Iti n I I be t the  CPI will verage,  ay,   percent  ver  the  next  10 years,  t ould  be  like  hooting  ish  n  a a s 3 o i w s f i barrel o  go buy  that  articular  curity th  a 10-year aturity  ecause  it  as  an implicit t p se wi m b h inflation sk  f  well  under  percent. hat are  we to  make of  that? ri o 2 W

MR. PARRY. That  was my  question!

MR.  FISHER.  I  don't  hink ou should nterpret    s  a  good forecast.  don't  hink t y i ita I t that's  at the  market  is  doing.  I  think he rade  ou are  suggesting  s  very ood one  and wh t t y i a g might  be  very  profitable  r ou if  ou or  anyone  wants  to ake it t his  oment.  [Laughter] fo y y m a t m

MR.  PARRY. When  can  we do that?  After he  end  of he  meeting?  [Laughter] t t

MR.  FISHER.  The illiquidity he  indexed onds  is  notorious.  he dealers  o  not of  t b T d like rading  hem. t t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Peter,  t  s ot  a  trade! ou buy  it,  nd  you  put  it  way. i i n Y a a MR. FISHER.  I agree  with  you.

MR.  KOHN. I  do think hat he  market as  put  a greater  remium on holding iquid t t h p l assets  n  these ery ncertain  imes.  We  can  see  that  n  the pread etween  Treasury ecurities i v u t i s b s and  federal  gency  securities, n  the  benchmark  agency  securities, ch are xtraordinarily a eve whi e liquid.  hat  spread as  widened out  by 15 basis oints. he on-the-run, f-the-run  easury T h p T of Tr spreads lso ave  widened  out. a h

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I  was about o  say  that  s  good  case.  This  is he t i a t extreme  form  of  that.

MR.  KOHN. This  is  an  extreme.  Peter isher  nd  Bob Parry re  right  n  the  sense F a a i that t  least  art f hat  ecline  n  the pread etween  nominal  and  real ates  nd  the a p o t d i s b r a extraordinarily    level f  the pread eflect t  so  much expected PIs  but  the xtra  remium low o s r no C e p on holding ery  liquid, minal, n-the-run  reasury onds.  That  premium has  driven hose v no o T b t rates  elow what  would be  sustainable  vels  n  calmer arkets,  onsistent th  expected b le i m c wi inflation  d  expected eal nterest  tes.    do  think t  s  sensible  otentially  asonable  o an r i ra I i i orp re t think hat  t east  ome of  this ecline  n  the  spread--and  t  as  been  a  fairly eep ecline  f t a l s d i i h st d o about  1/2  point  r  more since he iddle  of  August--represents  it f  a markdown  of  inflation o t m a  b o expectations    economies  all  over he  world  have weakened  and commodity prices  ave  come as t h down. In  these ircumstances,   ould  be  sensible  o  have  some shift  n  inflation  pectations, c itw t i ex even  if  he hole  level ooks ery  low and  may be  distorted. r interpretation his  ecline t w l v Ou of  t d was that  t eflected  e  extra  remium people  were willing  o  pay  for he iquid, minal i r th p t t l no Treasuries  s  well  as  some drop  in  inflation  pectations.   eems  logical. a ex Its

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you,  without bjection.  e  now move on to o W Ted Truman and  Dave Stockton.

MR. TRUMAN. What can  I  say  after  ll he alk  nd  ink  that  as  been a t t a h spilled  n  international nomic  and  financial velopments ince  he o eco de s t Committee's ugust  meeting?  It ccurred o  me that  he  Committee's A o t t

"central  endency" reference  ight  be  that    should hut p and  get ut f t p m I s u o o here.  My  so-called ternational  iends  ave  caused nough trouble, d in fr h e an you do  not eed  any  further planations om  me about he  consequences n ex fr t of  external  evelopments or he  U.S.  economy. d f t

On the  other  and,  you  may have  noticed  hat  ur  forecast r he h t o fo t external  ector  f  the .S.  economy has  weakened  further,  though t as s o U al i h not  changed  all hat  uch  from  the  one  prepared or he ugust  meeting, t m f t A before he  Russian uthorities  st  heir  ame of oulette th  the  domestic t a lo t g r wi and international ancial rkets  and  set ff   global ithdrawal rom fin ma o a w f risk.  hat  may be  surprising    light  f he  aforementioned  pilled k.  It s T in o t s in i clear  hat ur  external  orecast  ould have  been  different  thout he  change t o f w wi t in  our  assumption bout .S.  monetary  policy nd  the alming  influence, a U a c even  before ts elivery,   the  Chairman's estimony  ast  eek. i d of t l w

In  brief,  ur actors  ave  influenced  ur  outlook or et xports  n fo f h o f n e i different  rections: cent  trade ata ave  strengthened r  near-term di Re d h ou outlook. rojected  lower  growth  abroad  and  in  the  United tates  educes P s S r both  our  exports  nd  our  imports,  ut he  former s ore important  han  the a b t i m t latter. slightly  aker  dollar  ends o  strengthen r  exports  nd  weaken A we t t ou a our  imports.

On the  first ctor,  S.  trade  ata  for une  and  July ere  stronger  han fa U. d J w t we had  anticipated, ding  s  to  reduce lightly r  estimate  f  the egative lea u s ou o n contribution    net  exports  ver he our uarters  f  1998.  In  the  June  data, of o t f q o imports ere  weaker  than  we expected;  owever, his  eakness  brought he w h t w t second  quarter  s  a  whole  more in  line ith  our  model estimates.   both a w In June  and July ata,  e were  surprised  hat  xports,  articularly d w t e p of machinery, id  not  fall  s  much  as  we had  expected. n  the  Greenbook d a I forecast,   carried  ome of  that  trength  hrough nto  he emaining onths we s s t i t r m of  the  quarter.  owever,  in  light  f he  August  report  n shipments f H o t o o capital  oods  that  as released  ate  ast  eek and suggested  eakerg w l l w w than-expected  DE  shipments n  that onth,  we may well  have  overdone P i m our  cautious  ptimism.  On  the  other  and, here  ay well  be  some o h t m remaining esidual  easonality  at ill  oost ourth-quarter orts hat  e r s th w b f exp t w have  not aken  into ccount n  our  forecast. t a i

Turning  to  the  second actor, r  forecast r rowth  abroad, hich  was f ou fo g w very  weak to  begin  with, as  been  revised  own  again--by  alf    percentage h d h a point his ear  and  three  uarters  f  a  point  ext  year. his s he ajor t y q o n T i t m reason hy we now are  projecting   growth  in  real xports f oods  and w no e o g services  etween  the econd  quarter  f his  ear  and  the ourth uarter  f b s o t y f q o next ear,  n  contrast th  the y i wi 2-1/4 percent rowth  in  our revious  orecast. g p f

In  particular,  atin merica  we have  reduced  growth  by 1-1/2 and  2 forL A percentage  oints  his  ear nd  next,  espectively,  reaction  o  the educed p t y a r in t r access f  countries   this  egion o redit   international ital  arkets o in r t c in cap m

and  to  interest  tes  hat  ave  been  elevated  n  defense f  their rrencies. ra t h i o cu In  particular, have  negative  rowth  this  ear  and  next n  Brazil  nd we g y i a Venezuela, egative  rowth  this ear n  Chile,  nd  negative  rowth  next n g y i a g year  in  Argentina. e  are  assuming  that  razil  ill dopt  a program  that W B w a involves  ignificant  scal  ightening d  a  depreciation  he  Brazilian al s fi t an oft re with  negative  hort-run  ffects  n  Brazilian  rowth, ut  our  base ssumption s e o g b a is  that hese djustments  ill e  relatively  derly  nd  will ot ush  the t a w b or a n p Argentine eso  off ts  eg. p i p

With respect  o  Asia  other han  Japan,  e have  reduced lightly  r t t w s ou already  ery  weak outlook. here  are  a  few  signs f  a  bottoming ut  of v T o o economic  activity    Korea--ask he .S.  steel  ndustry--and  ailand,  ut in t U i Th b not  enough  to  lead s  to  alter r  basic utlook. u ou o

Turning  to  the  industrial  untries,   have  not  altered  ur asic iew co we o b v of  the  weak outlook n  Japan.  We  had  anticipated  e  cut  that  ccurred i th o earlier is  onth in  the  Bank of apan's  arget  or he  overnight  ate.  The th m J t f t r official  lease  n second-quarter owth  suggested  hat ctivity s  not re o gr t a wa quite s  weak as  we expected,  argely  ecause f  a  sharper-than-anticipated a l b o decline  n  real mports. e  expect he  third  uarter  o ecord  fourth i i W t q t r a consecutive  egative  uarter,    part ecause f  delays n  the n q in b o i implementation  f  the  program  of  fiscal imulus.  e  now anticipate  at o st W th more of  the  effects  hat  rogram  will e  felt  n  1999. oft p b i

We  have  weakened our  outlook or he  other oreign  -7  countries f t f G more significantly  light  f  the eterioration    global inancial nditions, in o d of f co spillovers  om  Russia,  astern urope,  and  Latin merica, nd  in  the  case fr E E A a of  Euroland,    stronger  urrency  hat  as  affected r  outlook or ermany a c t h ou f G in  particular.  is  deterioration  curs espite  ignificant  anges  in  our Th oc d s ch assumptions bout  monetary  policies   these  conomies.  In  the nited a in e U Kingdom, we now assume  that nterest  tes  ill ecline  y 125 basis  oints i ra w d b p by  the  end  of 999,  to  a  level 50  basis oints  ower han  we assumed  in 1 1 p l t August.  In  Canada,  interest  tes  re  assumed  to  decline  n  line  ith .S. ra a i w U rates,  ut ith  a longer ag  and  from  the levated  evel  o  which  the ank of b w l e l t B Canada pushed  them  in  late  ugust.  In  Euroland,  e assume  that hort-term A w s rates  onverge o  the  current  erman  level  y  the nd  of  the  year  and  remain c t G b e there hrough  the  end of he  forecast  eriod,   contrast   the  assumption n t t p in o i the  August  Greenbook  of  a rise  f  75 basis  oints  ver he ourse f  1999. o p o t c o We  have  not  assumed  that  he utcome  of he  German election  ill ffect t o t w a policy r  the  economy during he  forecast  eriod;  t emains  to  be  seen  if  e o t p i r w will e  right. b

With respect  o  monetary  policy  n  Euroland,  t s lear  hat  ight  ow t i i i c t r n euro-area  entral  ankers o  not  want  to  lower  interest  tes  elow the c b d ra b current  erman level  efore he  European  system  of  central  anks  becomes G b t b operational  January ,  1999. However,  in  considering  ow attitudes  y on 4 h ma change  going  forward,    found  it nstructive onsider  ow the  outlook or I i toc h f

growth  in  Euroland as  changed  over he  past 2 month . h t 1 Using  our  own forecasts r  the -7 members of he  Euro  area s  a  proxy, ur  current fo G t a o forecast r rowth  over  the our uarters  f  1998 is  lower  than  we thought fo g f q o it ould  be  a  year go  by  three  enths  n  France,  our enths  n  Germany, and w a t i f t i one  percentage  oint  n  Italy. oreover,  contrary  o  European  protestations p i M t that  he sian  crisis s  had  little  fect   Europe, ur  estimate  f  the t A ha ef on o o contribution   net  exports  s alf    percentage  oint ower or taly,  /4 of i h a p l f I 1-1 points  ower  in  Germany,  and  2-1/4  points  ower  in  rance.  As the uropeans l l F E have  pointed ut, hey  have  had  a  positive  urprise  domestic emand, o t s on d leading  o  caution bout onetary  policy  asing n  Frankfurt--both  the t a m e i at Bundesbank  and  at he CB.  Nevertheless,   he  euro  should  appreciate t E ift against  he  dollar  y  more than  the oughly 0  percent hat  e are rojecting t b r 1 t w p from  the  second  quarter  f his  ear  to he ourth uarter  f ext  year,  e o t y t f q o n w could  well  see  a  reduction  n  interest  tes  efore e see  an increase. i ra b w

With respect  o  my  third  actor, S.  economic activity,  e ownward t f U. th d revision  o  U.S.  growth, espite ur  changed  assumption bout  U.S. t d o a monetary  policy,  the  major  factor  ehind  our  projection   somewhat is b of slower  growth  of  imports f oods  and  services. o g

Fourth,  he  dollar  as  weakened a  bit  ore than  we expected ver he t h m o t intermeeting  eriod,  rimarily  gainst  he ajor  foreign  urrencies. p p a t m c We expect he  dollar  o  continue  o  decline  n  average uring he orecast t t t o d t f period,  eaching  oughly he ame point y  the nd  of  1999 in  terms f  our r r t s b e o real 9-currency  ndex  as  we had  projected  n  the ugust  Greenbook.  This 2 i i A forecast  eems  reasonable  ith  respect  o  the ajor  currencies,  ven  the s w t m gi roughly  parallel justment  n  our  monetary  policy  ssumptions ere  and ad i a h abroad.  However,  the  slightly  aker  dollar   the ear erm  tends o we in n t t strengthen  ur  outlook or xports nd  weaken our  outlook or mports   bit. o f e a f i a

The combined  influence  f hese orces n our  outlook or eal et o t f o f r n exports  s o  weaken it  omewhat further,  t  not  by  a  huge amount. i t s bu However,  the  risks  ver he  forecast riod s  a  whole  remain  skewed to  the o t pe a downside.  Moreover,  in  thinking  bout  Federal eserve olicy  n  this a R p i context,  he  issue  s ot  simply ne  of ow  developments n  the est  f he t i n o h i r o t world  will ffect  s.  Under  current  ircumstances,  e  size f  the otential a u c th o p linkages  rom  Federal eserve  actions  r  inactions  he est  f he  world f R o tot r o t and  back  onto  the .S.  economy appears o  have  been  magnified.

MR.  STOCKTON. The changes  in  the nternational ironment ust i env j sketched ut  by  Ted Truman  were  important  lements n  the lterations  at o e i a th we made to  the  Greenbook  forecast.  owever,  as  you  know,  we also ave H h had  to ontend  with  the oticeably  ore  negative  omestic inancial c n m d f conditions  f  the  past onth or  so. The stock arket  has  dropped  roughly o m m 5  percent  ver  the  intermeeting riod nd, s  Peter  isher  oted,  olatility o pe a a F n v

But  the  real ction  n  the orecast llows rom  the harp lowdown that a i f fo f s s we are  projecting r rivate  omestic  final  emands. That  slowdown fo p d d results t  only  from  the  waning  of ositive nancial fluences at no p fi in th propelled  rowth  previously,  t  their  artial versal   many cases. ith g bu p re in W corporate  arnings  xpected o  continue agging n  coming quarters, e e t s i we anticipate  at  quity  rices  ill ecline  till rther. gh and  rising  quity th e p w d s fu Hi e values o doubt  contributed portantly   the  six ercent nnual ate ains n im to p a r g in  consumption  in  the irst lf f his ear. ver  the  next ew  months, his f ha o t y O f t stimulus  hould issipate,  d  the  past nd  prospective cline  n  household s d an a de i net  worth  should egin  to ut nto pending. ousing  starts so eceived b c i s H al r a boost rom  higher tock rices  s  well  as  from  a strong  ob arket  and f s p a j m declining  ortgage  interest  tes.  lthough  we expect ortgage  rates  o m ra A m t hover  around  their  ecent  ows, he rop  in  stock rices  nd  the lower r l t d p a s income and  employment growth  that  e are rojecting ould  turn ousing w p sh h from  the  considerable us  observed n  1998 to  a  modest  negative  n  the irst pl i i f half  f ext  year. o n

I o r t o

On the  upside,  here imply ay be more near-term omentum  to  the t s m m economy than  is  contemplated  y our rojection.  I  noted arlier,  st  of b p As e mo the  incoming  economic  indicators  ve  remained  upbeat f  late.  nd while ha o A we expect he  economic news over  the ext onth or  so  to  remain  fairly t n m bright, rward  indicators ll eed  to  show a  considerable ftening fore fo wi n so be too  long n  order o e  on track or ur  first-half  wdown. Given the i t b f o slo resilience  at  he  U.S.  economy has  exhibited  n  this  xpansion nd,  at  least th t i e a until  ecently,  e  basically und  fundamentals, usehold  and  business r th so ho spending lans ay prove  more durable han  we have  projected.  his p m t T upside isk  ould be  further  mplified  f  he egative  entiment  hat  as r w a i t n s t h gripped inancial rkets  in  recent  eeks were  to  be  substantially eviated f ma w all by  an easing f olicy.  e  don't  ee  that s  the  best et, ut t s o p W s a b b i i a possibility.

On the  downside, here re  always  risks  ssociated th  negotiating t a a wi a slowdown in  aggregate  emand of  the imension  included  n  our  forecast. d d i Despite  he  sharp ownshift  n  growth  that  e are  projecting r he irst t d i w fo t f half f  next ear, his  orecast n  still   characterized    one in  which  the o y t f ca be as economy achieves   "soft  anding." y that    mean that  n  our  projection a l B I i firms,  y  and  large,  oresee  he  softening  emand and  adjust  roduction b f t ofd p promptly,  reventing  he  imbalances  n  inventories,  capital  quipment, p t i in e and  in  workers hat  ave  tipped lowdowns into ecessions   times n  the t h s r at i past.

Finally,  don't  ave  much to  add  to ur  Greenbook discussion  f  the I h o o outlook or ages and prices.  he inflation  ojection d  its  eterminants f w T pr an d have  changed  little  nce he  last  eeting, nd  we continue  o e  on the  low si t m a t b side f  the  consensus. onsumer prices re  projected  o  pick p some next o C a t u year.  After eclining  harply  his  ear,  oth  oil nd  non-oil  mport rices d s t y b a i p turn  up  in  1999, nd  labor arkets ill e  tight  hrough he  middle  of  2000. a m w b t t Nevertheless,  believe  hat  here ill e  some important  actors  imiting we t t w b f l the  deterioration  inflation.  ak  demand and  ample  capacity  n  the in We i factory  ector  re  expected o  result   further clines   capacity  tilization s a t in de in u rates,  nd  that  hould elp eep  a  lid  n goods  prices. a s h k o

In  addition,  expect hat rowth  in  hourly ompensation ill oon we t g c w s level ut  and then  drift  ower ver  the  projection riod. e  expect his o l o pe W t restraint   nominal  pay  gains o  come from  both  the  supply  and  the emand on t d sides f  the  labor arket.  On the emand side,  ith  profit rgins  under o m d w ma pressure  nd  the  climate  nhospitable   rice ncreases,  rms  are ikely a i top i fi l to resist tsized  ay  increases. reover,  some forms  of lexible y  should ou p Mo f pa decelerate.  ertainly,  nuses  in  the inancial dustry  re ot  heading or C bo f in a n f a banner  year.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. Questions rom  my  colleagues? f

MR.  PARRY. I  have  two  questions.  ed,  it eems  to e that  ur  international T s m o assumptions re  now fairly ose o  the  worse  case  scenario  hat  as presented  o  us  last  ear n a cl t t w t y i terms  of  the eal mpact  on the  economy. Would it ake sense o  think  n  terms  of   worse  case r i m t i a again, nd what  would  be  its  robability?  you have  any  thoughts bout  where the isks  re  in a p Do a r a terms  of uch  a  forecast? s

MR.  TRUMAN. In  preparing  or his  eeting,    looked ack  at he ork that  e did f t m I b t w w on a  worse  case cenario  ate  ast  ear.  In  one  sense,  e are lose o  the orse  case,  ut t  as s l l y w c t w b i h taken  a  different  rm.  The sense n  which  we are lose s  essentially  that he otal  mpact n fo i c i in t t i o the .S.  economy is ommensurate  with  it.  t as  taken he  form,  however, f he  deeper U c I h t o t recessions  nd  problems  in  Asia  including  apan  and  no  spread o  Latin merica.  We  had  in  our a J t A

worse  case  scenario    generalized  pread o  Latin merica. It s  little  barrassing  o  say  so  at a s t A i a em t this  ime,  ut  this  roves he ess han  reliable  ture f orecasting.   had  no  growth  in  Asian t b p t l t na o f We economies  last  ear n  our  worse  case cenario  nd  also o growth  in  Latin merica.  We  now y i s a n A have  positive owth  on average n  Latin merica and  negative  rowth  in  the  Asian  economies. gr i A g So,  we are  close  o  our orse  case  forecast,  t  we have  a slightly  fferent  x. t w bu di mi

I  think  hat  utcome also oints  o  the econd art f  your  question  bout here  these t o p t s p o a w foreign conomies  are  heading.   probably hould ave  said his  n  my oral resentation.  r e I s h t i p Ou outlook or atin merica is  quite  loomy and  is  much gloomier han  I  think nyone  will ee  in f L A g t a s other orecasts. at  may just  e  because  we did  ours  three ays  ago, nd  most  of he  others  ou f Th b d a t y have  seen  were  done  three  eeks ago.  But  as  was pointed  ut n  the reenbook, e made a w o i G w rather  odest  adjustment.    always  find t asiest   think bout urrent  ccount eficits,   east m I i e o a c a d atl in  terms  of ur  own economy,  by  calibrating  em on the  basis f  how large  n  adjustment  n  the o th o a i deficit es  with  everything  lse hat  s appening  in  the  economy. It ives e a shorthand  ay go e t i h g m w of  assessing w big he  impact s n the  United tates.  The answer  there  s hat  n  our  forecast ho t i o S i t i we only  cut he urrent  ccount eficits   Latin merica  in  half  rom  where  we had  them  last t c a d of A f year.  We  are  still suming  that  he  major  countries   Latin merica can  finance  30 billion as t in A $ current  ccount eficits  ther  han  $60  billion ficits.   s asy  to  envision, pecially   light a d ra t de Iti e es in of  what  has  happened  in  Asia,  hat  he umber could  be  zero r  a  $30 billion rplus  ithout ny t t n o su w a stretch  f he magination.    think hat  ill e  the  next spect f his. o t i I t w b a o t

One other oint bout  Asia  is  that  ur  1998  forecasts r hina  and Singapore re p a o fo C a about  the  same as  they ere  earlier.  s he  affected  conomies  in  Asia  that ere  much  weaker w Iti t e w than  we had  them  before. ut  clearly   Latin merica and,  I  think,  n  eastern  urope  and B in A i E Russia--which  re  not s  important  o  our  economy as  to he  economies  of urope  as  I  tried a a t t E to

illustrate y little  ory bout  our  forecasts  he  G-3 nati  ns  within uroland--there  early in  m st a oft E cl has  been a ig  impact. b

The interesting  velopment  is ur  forecast.  did  not  go back  and  look  at t,  ut de o I i b I believe  ur  U.S.  forecast r 998 even  now is robably tronger  han  it as a year go. o fo 1 p s t w a Interestingly,    Euroland orecast  s lightly aker  than  we had  it ast  eptember.  The Euro our f i s we l S area  has  taken  a  very  arge  it n the xternal  ide.  This  suggests,  would think, at  here  s l h o e s I th t i a risk f  some substantial  mulation n the  downside.  Now,  we could  talk urselves  nto eing o cu o o i b too  gloomy about  these hings. t

MR.  PARRY. Sure.

MR.  TRUMAN. It  is  seful  o hink bout orse  case  scenarios,  t  worse  case u t t a w bu scenarios  o  not  always  come true. et  me just  nd  on  that oint. d L e p

MR.  PARRY. I  have  a  question  or ave Stockton. he assumption n  the  forecast  s f D T i i that  he  saving ate emains asically nstant  t  one  half  ercent.  hat  seems a  little  rprising t r r b co a p T su given  what  happens  to he  equity arket  and  particularly h  the oefficient  at  ou  have  in t m wit c th y terms  of  net orth.  I  presume  that  hat  is appening s hat  he eakness  in  the  equity  arket s w w h i t t w m i being  offset  y  such  things  s  lower nterest  tes,  hich  stimulate nsumption.  Would you b a i ra w co say  that our  forecast at he aving ate ill ot e moving up as  a result  f he  assumed y th t s r w n b o t decline  n  the tock arket  might  be  a  downside  risk o he  outlook? i s m t t

MR.  STOCKTON. There  is  some downside  risk  here.    think  he  size f he tock t I t o t s market  correction  have  in  this orecast,  ken y  itself, ld have  been  expected o  boost he we f ta b wou t t saving ate y  at east    couple  of enths.    should oint ut  that  ne  of he  things  hat  eeps  the r b l a t I p o o t t k saving ate own is hat e do  have  some offset  oming  from  lower  interest  tes, d  we do r d t w c ra an have some offset  oming  through hen income growth  slows  below its  ermanent  rate. hat c w p T helps  to old  up  consumption  a  little. h

MR.  PARRY. I see.

MR.  STOCKTON. But  I  think here  s ome downside  risk  here  s  you  suggest. t i s t a

MR.  PARRY.

MR.  STERN. Thank you. Ted,  I  would  like ou to  elaborate  little    Brazil nd  the y a on a risks  here  ecause  I  have  the  sense hat t east  ome in  the nternational ancial mmunity t b t a l s i fin co are  trying  o  draw  a line  n he  sand  with  regard o  Brazil.  et, hile  you said ou were t i t t Y w y expecting  he  Brazilian  eal  o  depreciate,  u are  expecting  hat  o  proceed n  an  orderly  ay. t r t yo t t i w Obviously,  t s ot  hard  to  imagine  something uch worse  happening. i i n m

MR.  TRUMAN. When  we do  these orecasts,  ere s   tendency  to e at east  lightly f th i a b l s conservative. ere  are  so  many different enarios  hat  re  possible  or razil. e  took  a  sort Th sc t a f B W of  average f  what  we felt  as a  reasonable  et f cenarios  n  which  we assumed that  he o w s o s i t Brazilians sically ve three roblems: hey  have a  fiscal oblem; hey  have  a  banking ba ha p t pr t problem;  and  they ave  a  competitiveness oblem.  We  are  assuming  that  hese roblems re  all h pr t p a somewhat interrelated.   hey  address  he  fiscal  roblem  that  ill e  enough to  avert   complete Ift t p w b a loss f  confidence.  lthough  the xchange  rate ay have  to  give, t  ay give n  a way that o A e m i m i either  s  a  discrete valuation  ollowed y  a faster te f  crawl  or imply  faster te f  crawl i de f b ra o s a a o so  that  y  the nd  of he  period,  he eal  ill e  at  a  level  hat  y one  rule f humb appears o  be b e t t r w b t b o t t sustainable.  e indicator ggests  hat  he  currency ay be 15 percent vervalued.  o,  the  real On su t t m o S could  get own to  an  acceptable  evel ithout oo  much  of  an  adjustment. d l w t

I'm  not  sure hat  you  mean by  drawing  the ine  n  the  sand, nless  ou  mean drawing w l i u y the  line  n  the and  in  terms f he  exchange  rate  tself? i s o t i

MR.  STERN. Yes.

MR. TRUMAN. I  think hat  s ne  of he roblems  with  these ituations.  azil  as t i o t p s Br h an  election  Sunday,  so  I  don't  magine  that  he resident  f razil  s oing  to ay  they  are on i t p o B i g s about  to evalue.  Nor  do I  think hey  want  to  devalue. hey actually y be  considering d t T ma a widening  of he and.  Setting   faster te f rawl  is ot  as  much of  a problem  as  a  devaluation. t b a a o c n They might  want  to alk hemselves  nto hat,  aybe correctly.  id  seem likely  o  us  as  we t t i t m Itd t prepared ur  forecast at  here  ould be  a  devaluation  r  some adjustment  f heir  xchange o h t w o o t e rate ver  the eriod. ut since e did  not  know when it as going  to  come,  whether  it as o p B w w w going  to  come tomorrow or  next  week or he  week after  hat  r  in  January,  nd  whether t as t t o a i w going  to  be  discrete   gradual,  e put t n  as  being  at he esired  evel    year rom  now. We or w i i t d l a f drew a straight  ne etween  its  re- nd  post-devaluation els  o  that t  id  not rift  round li b p a lev s i d d a during he  forecast  eriod.   think here  re  very izable  ownside  risks.  he worse  the cenario, t p I t a s d T s the  more  likely  bviously  t ould  have  ripple  ffects t ust  n  Latin merica  but  elsewhere. o i c e no j i A

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Any further  uestions? q

MR.  HOENIG. Ted,  I  have  a  question  n Europe.  Some of he  discussions at    have o t th I heard  in  terms  of  whether urope  should ower ts nterest  tes  re hat s  they  move toward E l i i ra a t a convergence,  heir  nterest  tes  re  coming  down in  effect.  o you  agree ith  that? t i ra a D w

MR.  TRUMAN. Yes,  and  that  as  been  in ur  forecast.   that oint,  e have h o On p w tended  to  be  somewhat more optimistic  l long.  That  may not  have  been  the ase  initially al a c when we probably ad  convergence t  a  higher  evel. airly  arly  n,  however,  we had h a l F e o convergence  at he  relatively  w  French  and  German level  nd  the  beneficial  fects  f hat  n t lo a ef o t o the  Euroland conomies.  I  don't  ant  to  minimize he ctual  roblems  that hey ave  had. e w t a p t h There  are  two  groups  of ountries. aly, ere  the  actual  erformance f he conomy is ot  so c It wh p o t e n great,  s owering ts  nterest  tes.  ne could  argue  that  s ot o  bad, ut hat ets veryone i l i i ra O i n s b t g e involved  n  the  fiscal ghts  hat  hey  are aving. hen we have  the ther roup  of ountries  hat i fi t t h T o g c t

have  higher  nterest  tes  ecause hey ant to  pursue  tighter  netary  policies. e question i ra b t w mo Th then  is,  hat  about rance  and  Germany?  At  the  moment, there  s o  reason or hem to  panic, w F i n f t and  I'm  not  sure hat    necessarily  uld  panic.  In  my  view  it s  little  olish  o  say  that  here t I wo i a fo t t is o  way one  can  imagine  why they ould need  to  lower nterest  tes.  n  some sense,  ur n w i ra I o forecast es  have  them  lowering nterest  tes.  t's  st  hat  y  not aving  an increase  n  interest do i ra I ju t b h i rates ssociated  ith  a  boom  condition  n  the  wake of MU,  we now have  them with  unchanged a w i E interest  tes.  he rate ifferential his orecast   some sense s  not hat  uch different  an  it ra T d in  t f in i t m th was in  the  last  orecast. f

MR.  HOENIG. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Further  uestions  rom  anyone? Who  would  like  o q f t start  he oundtable? resident  oskow. t r P M

MR.  MOSKOW. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. Since  our  last  eeting,  conomic m e prospects  t ome and abroad  have  changed  considerably,  t  much of he  data hat e typically a h ye t t w use  to  gauge  the orces t  work in  our  economy have  changed  only  marginally.  n  some respects, f a I conditions  n  the  Seventh  District  main  little  anged  since id August.  Growth in  the i re ch m manufacturing  ector  as  continued  o  slow  though  levels  f ctivity main  high.  Labor  markets s h t o a re are  still ght  nd  price  ressures main  benign.  However,  the  depth  and  the readth f  actual ti a p re b o and  anticipated  pacts f  international elopments n  our  District  onomy now seem greater im o dev i ec than  they  did nly  a  few weeks ago.  I  think t  s air  o ay  that  any of y contacts  re  much o i i f t s m m a more nervous  about he  future  han  they ere  in  August.  For  example, n  the anufacturing t t w i m sector  e increasingly  ar eports  f  weakness  even  among  firms ith  little  rect  nternational w he r o w di i exposure.  The strength  hat  e do  see  is imited  rimarily   housing-related  dustries. t w l p to in Although  the  Chicago  Purchasing  anagers'  composite ndex  indicates newed  strength  n M i re i September, e believe  his  argely  eflects  rebound  from  the M w t l r a G strike.  urthermore,  he F t

District  eel anufacturers  re eing  adversely  ffected  y  increased  .S.  capacity, st m a b a b U significantly reased  mports,  nd  softening  emand in  some market  segments.  A major inc i a d producer f  corrugated  oxes  reported  hat  emand for oxes  from  manufacturers  as  declined o b t d b h significantly he  last  everal  onths.  Further, veral  embers of  our  Advisory ouncil  on in  t s m se m C Agriculture,  bor, nd Small  Business eported  hat mong some District  nufacturers, La a r t a ma earnings nd  new orders ad  declined, ertime hifts  ere  being  cut ack,  and  layoffs  ere a h ov s w b w likely  f  xport rders  id  not  recover  oon. i e o d s

In  contrast,  ntacts  n  the uto ndustry  emain  upbeat bout  U.S.  sales rospects. co i a i r a p After veraging nly  14.1  million  nits  n  July nd  August, ight  ehicle  ales eem to  be  running a o u i a l v s s at  around  14-3/4 lion  nits  n  September, ith  Big  Three  projections r he ourth uarter mil u i w fo t f q around  15 million  nits. utside f  light  ehicles, e  retailing  cture  s omewhat mixed. u O o v th pi i s Michigan  retailers  rveyed hrough  early  o  mid-September  report  o deterioration  current su t t n i sales  r  in  expectations out ales  hree onths  ahead.

MR. PARRY. Mr.  Chairman,  solid  verall  conomic growth  continued  n  the  Twelfth o e i District    recent  onths,  although  he  pace  slowed  from  earlier   he  year. etween  June  and in m t int B August, istrict  yrolls  xpanded  by  2.3  percent t n  annual  rate,  own from  the  percent D pa e a a d 3 pace  of he  first lf  f  the ear.  Construction d services  s  well  as  finance,  nsurance, d t ha o y an a i an

real state  ontinued  o  grow rapidly  n  recent  onths.  However,  the istrict's  ufacturing e c t i m D man sector  as  not  fared s  well.  Reduced export emand and  a  more general lowdown in  high-tech h a d s manufacturing  ave  led  to  a significant  akening  overall  n  manufacturing.  istrict h we i D manufacturing  mployment has  contracted  lightly    far his ear fter  ising  .7  percent n e s so t y a r 3 i 1997. The  deceleration    manufacturing  as  been  concentrated   California,  th in h in wi manufacturing  mployment falling  2 percent  o  far  his  ear. hile  many sectors  f e 1/ s t y W o California's ufacturing  ave  slowed  in  1998,  producers f  high-tech  roducts  ave  been man h o p h particularly  rd  hit. owever,  employment growth  in  high-tech  oftware  nd  business  ervices ha H s a s remains  strong.

Turning  to  the ation,  he utlook or conomic activity s  deteriorated  nce e met n t o f e ha si w in  August  largely  ecause f  a  continued  ecline  n  our  stock arket  and a  worsening utlook or b o d i m o f growth  in  the est  f he orld.  Under  the  assumptions f  an  unchanged  federal  unds ate  nd r o t w o f r a no further  hange  in  the  stock arket,  e have  lowered  our  forecast r eal DP  growth  for he c m w fo r G t remainder f  this ear nd 1999 by 1/2 percentage  oint  o  only  1-1/2  percent.    actually e  risks o y a p t I se on both  sides f  this  orecast.  the pside,  he conomy has  consistently  tperformed ost o f On u t e ou m forecasts r he  past hree ears.  On the  downside, f  course,  he  stock arket  is till fo t t y o t m s overvalued ccording o  most  models.  In  addition,   s  possible  hat  he xpected conomic a t it i t t e e performance  of  the est  f  the orld  could  be  even  worse  than  we all ave  been  forecasting  d, r o w h an of  course,  e cannot ule ut  future  hocks  in  financial rkets. eal  GDP  growth  in  the w r o s ma R neighborhood f  our  forecast,  believe, uld  help  to  ease  tight  abor arkets,  nd  this ould o we wo l m a w reduce  the isk f igher nflation    the uture.  nder  our  forecast,  ward pressures  rom  labor r o h i in f U up f markets  would moderate  over  the ext  couple f  years. oreover, ny  pressures  rom  this n o M a f source ost  likely  ould  be  offset  diminished  nflation  pectations,  e igher  ollar, ple m w by i ex th h d am industrial  pacity, lling mmodity prices, mewhat higher  rend roductivity  owth, nd ca fa co so t p gr a

Since  the eriod f arket  volatility id-August,   have  been  regularly nvassing p o m in  m I ca the  CEOs  of  the egion's jor  banks, ne  of  our  insurance  ompanies, nd  a  major  mutual  fund r ma o c a to  determine irst-hand  w they  see  their  wn  business  isks  nd  the isks  acing arkets ore f ho o r a r f m m generally.  hese  conversations ve  served  to  underline  hree hemes  that eem interesting T ha t t s to me. First,  spite  orldwide  market  volatility,  ght   quality,  d  disclosures   losses, de w fli to an of settlements    global arkets ave  been largely  naffected.  he CEO  of ne  major  global in m h u T o custodian, ich  settles   more than  50 countries  aily, dicated at  e  believes  he hanges  in wh in d in th h t c settlement actices  rought bout  by  the vents f  October  1987  have  enabled arkets  around pr b a e o m the  world  to  withstand  his  eriod f nstability,  east  o  far.  he only roblem  that  is irm t p o i at  l s T p h f has  experienced  s elated   settlements volving  alaysian  securities.  th  the mposition  f i r to in M Wi i o currency ontrols  n  Malaysia,  here  ere  distinctions wn between  residents d  nonresidents. c i t w dra an Those  have  prompted  the ntroduction  ather  omplicated  dministrative  asures.  But  that i ofr c a me is omething  his irm s  well  capable f  handling. s f i o

Second,  the  CEO  of he  region's e  major  global ank  commented on the  recent t on b widening  of  spreads  nd  what  he  sees s  a  rather  ignificant ing p of iquidity    all arkets, a a s dry u l in m the  same phenomenon  we have  seen  in  our ables  nd  charts  n  spreads. n  that  ank's  iew, he t a o I b v t widening  of  spreads  as  been  exacerbated  t east  o  some extent  y  some of he  supervisory h a l t b t letters    credit  tandards.  hose letters  ve  been  interpreted    a warning  about EITs or on s T ha as R

cautioning  bout  REITs and  what  the  bank  sees s  an  unexplained  owngrading  by  the a a d OCC of shared ational  redits.  inally, e ank  is  especially ncerned bout arket  turmoil n  Brazil n c F th b co a m i and  Latin merica  more generally.  his ank  traditionally    benefited  rom  a  flight   quality A T b has f to during eriods f  financial rmoil  n  Latin merica and  regards heir  wn positions   more or p o tu i A t o as less evaluation  roof,  ut  their  oncerns re  heightened  onetheless. d p b c a n

Finally, ile  all hose ontacted  elieve  he  current  arket  retrenchment  s verdone, wh t c b t m i o they  also elieve  hat  preads ere  far oo  narrow  previously. ,  in  some sense hey egard he b t s w t So t r t financial rket  conditions  s  in  part   return  o  more normal  spreads  n  the arkets,  hough ma a a t i m t there learly  s  a  concern  that  he ttendant  eleveraging ll ave  a  near-term  ontractionary c i t a d wi h c effect.  hose  organizations  at  re  publicly  eld ave  seen  a  sharp eterioration  the alue  of T th a h h d in v their  tocks n  the  market, hough  they dmit  that he  four o ive imes arnings  eflected s i t a t t f t e r in previous  arket  valuations obably as a  bit igh.  Moreover, nstitutions  t  ave  a  track m pr w h i tha h record f  growing  by acquisition  e  a time  of  potential portunity,  th  the  prices  f maller o se op wi o s banking  and  financial stitutions  oming  more realistic.  early,  ven  the  ill  inds  of  global in bec Cl e w financial security y blow some good fortune o  those ho are  positioned   recognize  t. in ma t w to i

On the  national  cene, e have  little    quarrel  ith  in  the reenbook's orecast  or s w to w G f f 1998 and  early 999. However, we and  other orecasters  e ot  as  pessimistic    the  Greenbook 1 f ar n as about  the  full  ear 999. We  see  a  bit  igher rowth, ower  unemployment,  and  a  small ickup y 1 h g l p in  inflation  en  without he asing f onetary  policy  mbodied in  the  Greenbook  forecast. ev t e o m e These  differences sult  rom  several  actors.  e  have  not  built  n  a  further  rop  in  stock arket re f f W i d m prices  rom  current  evels.  ur estimate  f  the  economy's  potential   somewhat lower, esulting f l O o is r in  more  pressure  rom  tight  abor  arkets.  Our  assessment  s hat iven rofit essures,  ge f l m i t g p pr wa increases  ill egin  to  show through  more  directly to rices. owever,  this  stimate  s  fraught w b in p H e i with  risk, d I  must  say  that  e  are ery  humble about  our  ability   orecast flation  ends n an w v tof in tr i

On  the ational  ront,  see  a relatively  rong omestic  economy over he  near n f we st d t term,  and  the rospects  re or nly  moderate  but  clear  ownward  revisions   our  third-quarter p a f o d in forecast.  e  are  now projecting ird-quarter   growth  in  the  1.8  percent  ange. e  think W th GDP r W that  he  fundamentals  ave  changed  only  marginally  n the  domestic ide ut hat he  risks  re t h o s b t t a now slightly    the  downside  on net. f  course ur  chief  oncern,  s  it s or thers,   the isk  o to O o c a i f o is r t continued  rowth  due to  turmoil  n  international  rkets  and  how much developments n  those g i ma i markets  will eed ack  to  the omestic conomy.

MR.  STERN. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  As far s  the istrict  onomy is a D ec concerned,  eneral  onditions  emain  favorable, though    think t's  ir  o  say  that  he  trends g c r al I i fa t t are  a  little  re mixed  than  was the ase arlier    the  year. ttitudes  ave  not  changed mo c e in A h dramatically,  t  I  do  think here  s   little  re caution  nd  a little  re concern ow than  there bu t i a mo a mo n

was earlier.  the  positive de,  abor  arkets  remain  very  tight.  he unemployment rate  n  the On si l m T i state  f innesota  has  dropped  to  a  new record ow,  and  this  ust  be  the hird  r  fourth ecord o M l m t o r monthly  low established  is ear. ousing  activity  d nonresidential  nstruction tivity th y H an co ac in general emain  strong.  uto sales  re  healthy.  he weaknesses  are n  agriculture, re  I  think r A a T i whe the  problems  are ell  recognized  nd  are uite evere n  at  least  arts f he  District,  parts  f w a q s i p o t in o the  manufacturing  conomy, and  in  mining  activity. ade  issues, pecially th  Canada,  have e Tr es wi become a matter f  concern,  nd  several  f  the overnors n  the  District  e  taking  ctions  t o a o g i ar a a least  o  show the  flag ith  regard o  trade. t w t

As far s  the  national  conomy is oncerned,    started   assuming  that  he ational a e c I by t n economy would grow at  trend,  hich  is ot  too  different  om  the odel forecast. en,  I  asked w n fr m Th myself  where  the isks  ie. ike  others,  concluded hat  he isks  t his  uncture  re ostly  on r l L I t t r a t j a m the  downside  relative   rend rowth.  I  don't  now exactly  ow I  would parcel hat  ut  on  a tot g k h t o quarter-by-quarter  is,  ut  that s  what  I  concluded. aving said hat,    think  e have  to  be bas b i H t I w careful  ot  to  get arried  way with  the  downside  risks.    am not  at ll anguine,  ut   think t s n c a I a s b I i i worth  reminding urselves  hat here as  been  a  lot f iscussion  round  this  able  n  recent o t t h o d a t i months,  indeed  in  recent  ears,  hat  he quity arkets  have  been  overvalued.  he implication y t t e m T was that  hose rices  ad  to  come down.  Indeed  they ave!  In  some sense,  e are  getting  hat t p h h w w we expected r  what  we hoped.  I  think  here as  been  a similar scussion  hat  uality  preads o t h di t q s were  far oo  narrow.  They  have  now widened  out. Again,  that  eems  to e  something hat  e t s b t w expected ould  happen and  hoped  would happen  in  the ontext  f   necessity r omestic w c o a fo d demand to  slow  to  a  pace  more consistent  th  the rowth  of ggregate  upply.  We  were wi g a s concerned  about  the xcessive  vailability  credit.  hose  conditions em to  be  changing. e a of T se Again,  that  s omething hat e anticipated  d  to  some extent  oped  for.  n  my view,  what  we i s t w an h I are  seeing  ere  to   great egree s evelopments hat  e either  xpected r  hoped  for,  nd  while, h a d i d t w e o a

as  I  said,    hink he  risks  re n the  downside,   believe  e should e  careful  ot  to ose ight  f It t a o I w b n l s o the  fact  hat  hese evelopments ere anticipated, east  n  part. hat I  conclude rom all his t t d w at  l i W f t is  that  t s ery  hard  to ee ny  inflationary entum i i v s a mom building  n  the urrent  nvironment.  So, i c e I  think e are  in  for urther riods f  modest  inflation. w f pe o

So, his  as a marked no t w d t w mood  change  on the  part f  many of  the  directors,  ile  others  rom  their  ocal  antage o wh f l v points--their  al  ity  r  economy--saw no  break  from  earlier ends. loc c o tr

In  construction,  mmercial  real state  ontinues  o  be very  strong hroughout  he co e c t t t District.    get  more reports  f verbuilding   the  upper  price  ange  of he  housing ector.

Probably  the  worst ituation    the istrict   hat f he  steel  ndustry.  teel s eing s in D ist o t i S i b impacted  very  severely  y imports. hile domestic onsumption  is oing  to  be  at ecord evels b W c g r l this ear,  e are  told hat  mports ere  up 43  percent  n  July. he steel  ompanies  are  now y w t i w i T c telling   that  here ill e  consolidations, manent  plant losings, d  companies  taken  over us t w b per c an by  foreign  nvestors,  obably he ritish, cause  the  domestic ompanies  are n  so  much i pr t B be c i difficulty.

One theme  that  ame out  of  meetings ith  advisory ouncil embers and  others c w c m around  the istrict   nvestor  aution.  e  get eports  hat  he ear actor  s ervasive.  e  hear D isi c W r t t f f i p W claims  of  a  daily  uildup n  cash  on the idelines;  vestors e arking ash  because  of b i s in ar p c uncertainty d are  waiting or t  o  subside. e  hear othing bout  what  will  dissipate  e  fear, an f i t W n a th when it ay happen, nd what will e  done  with  all he  cash  that  s arked  on  the  sidelines m a b t i p waiting  or he  green  lights   come on  again. f t to

Labor  markets ontinue  o  be  extremely ight.  urnover  is ising  nd  finding  ualified c t t T r a q replacements  s  taking  onger nd  longer.  One of  the anks  that  ires  hroughout  he egion nd i l a b h t t r a in  several  ther  tates  aid hat    year  ago  starting llers  re  earning  7 an  hour; hey re  now o s s t a te we $ t a earning  10. The bank  expects heir  onexempt  pay  to e  up  4-3/4    percent  his  ear  versus $ t n b to  5 t y 4 percent  n  1997. They also eported, ke ome others,  hat  ortgage  lending s t  record i r li s t m i a volumes.

Our retail les ave  been  very  strong.  etailers y  that  ales nd  profits r he hird sa h R a s a fo t t and  fourth  uarters  ill e  at  record evels  nd that  etailers  at  ource rom  Asia  are  doing q w b l a r th s f especially ll.  They are  not  as  optimistic out  1999 but  extremely  ptimistic out he  way we ab o ab t this  ear  will inish.  n  contrast  hat  somebody else aid,  ales  f  home furnishings ve y f I tow s s o ha been  very  strong, obably eflecting  e ousing ndustry.  elecommunications lso re  very pr r th h i T a a strong.

We  decided  to heck  on a  couple f evelopments n  parts  f he  service  ector  hat c o d i o t s t had  not  otherwise  een  reported.  ne was what  is  happening o otel ates, t  after  he  staff b O t h r bu t memo  on the  Watergate,    guess  I  don't  eed  to  report  n that! e  contacted  ajor heme and I n o W m t amusement parks  in  the  region.   myself s  part f ur  research  ffort  pent   weekend looking I a o o e s a at  those oller asters  t edar  Point! hey boast bout  having ore and  bigger oller asters r co a C T a m r co than  anywhere  else  n  the orld.

Another  bit f vidence s  to he  psychology n  our  area s hat aution  pparently  id o e a t i i t c a d not  hit  entucky  because  the horoughbred orse uction as the est ver.

In  two  days  alone n  September  56 yearlings re  sold or ver 1/2 million  ach.  Most i we f o $ e of  those orses ill e  sent o  Europe  and  Asia. h w b t

Turning  to  the ational  conomy,  I  can  save  some time  by  saying hat    agree ith n e t I w Gary Stern hat    lot f  the hanges--the eak  from  the  past hat  e have  seen--were  ssential. t a o c br t w e

We  have  known for  couple  of  years erhaps hat here  ere  certain  nsustainable  ends  t a p t t w u tr a work. As some sage  once  said,  nsustainable  ings  ave  a  habit f  ending. e  may not  like  he u th h o W t way they  ended, ut  it as essential  r hat o  happen.  The difficulty  is  how to  deal  with b w fo t t now the  attendant ocks  to  confidence.  e  have  a  long  history  f esponding  o  domestic vents sh W o r t e such  as  Nixon's age and  price ontrols  nd  the  stock arket  crash f  1987 and  to  international w c a m o events uch  as  financial ises  nd  military  ctions--including  ng the  latter e  Suez, he  Bay s cr a a amo th t of  Pigs,  nd  the  Gulf ar in  the  early  art f his ecade.

MR.  HOENIG. Mr.  Chairman,  if  ou were  to  ask  how the enth  District    doing y T is today, ou would  get  two  answers.  If ou looked t  any  metropolitan ea,  ou would  see  that  ts y y a ar y i economy is  still ry  strong,  ith  tight  abor  arkets nd  unemployment rates  hat  re  extremely ve w l m a t a low. When  you looked  at  retail les, u would  find hat  hey  remain  very  strong.  f ou sa yo t t I y looked  at ousing,  ou would  find t trong  verall.  ou also ould  hear  a  lot bout hanges  in h y i s o Y w a c attitudes    the  sense hat hile usiness  onditions e  strong,  eople  are  much less onfident in t w b c ar p c

about  the uture.  e  are  seeing ome of he ffects  f sia  in  our anufacturing  ector, f W s t e o A m s in health roducts or xample,  and  we have  anecdotal  ndications  at t  least  ome firms re p f e i th a s a backing  off  n plans o  invest  n  plant  nd  equipment  as  they ook  to  the uture.  ut, urrently, o t i a l f B c the  metropolitan ea  economies  are  still    very ood shape  in  our  District. ar in g

In  the ural  reas nd  in  the  energy ector,  get  a  completely  ifferent  swer. r a a s we d an Contacts n  the  energy ndustry,    you already  eard  for ome other istricts,   very i i as h s D are pessimistic out  the utlook or il. atural as,  which  is  more predominant n  our  region,  s  a ab o f o N g i i question  ark;  its  rospects  epend  on how the inter oes.

So demand is  down. e a o pr t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Is  the 0  percent  or he enth  District   ationwide? 4 f t T orn MR. HOENIG. Nationwide, ut  I  would say  that  ercentage  s ot  too ar ff he b p i n f o t mark for he  Tenth  District    well.  We  are aving ome bumper crops his  ear,  0  percent t as h s t y 2 increases  n  some areas. hat  is n top  of arlier creases.  o,  prices  bviously  re  down.  Our i T o e in S o a banks  are  saying hat  heir an  portfolios  rrently e  in  satisfactory dition, t  they t t lo cu ar con bu anticipate  an  problems  going  forward. hey already re  contacting   and others  bout hat lo T a us a w the  attitudes    examiners re  going  to  be with  regard o  carrying  ver oans nd  so  forth.  o, of a t o l a S there s  a  fair  egree f earishness   that  ector  f  the conomy and  concern  especially  ong i d o b in s o e am banks  in  the ural  reas. owever,  we need  to  put  that  n  the ontext f he  District    a hole, r a H i c o t as w which still pears o  be  generally  ound. ap t s

On the  national  conomy,  I  think  he  most  likely  utcome  next ear s  for  eal DP e t o y i r G growth  to  slow  to  below  trend nd  for nflation   emain  moderate.  I m concerned bout a i tor a a further  ownside  risks  o he  domestic conomy. Therefore,    believe    slight  asing f olicy d t t e I a e o p

would be  appropriate   this  ime. ut  I,  like  d Boehne,  would be  cautious  nd  deliberate at t B E a in adjusting licy t  this  ime.  I  don't  hink  e would  be  behind he urve  after    small  move. po a t t w t c a

I  want  to  add  a  couple  f oints  elating   policy.  irst, ile   see rowth  moving o p r to F wh I g down toward  or  below  the  economy's ong-term otential,  m not  as  pessimistic    the l p I  a as Greenbook at  this  ime.  I  think hat  s  why I  also m cautious  bout  how deliberate   are n t t i a a we i adjusting licy. econd,  I  believe  here  re  significant nside  risks  o  the  outlook,  s  I po S t a dow t a mentioned.  These  stem  from the  fact  hat here  re ignificant  owdowns in  the  economies  of t t a s sl Latin  America  and  Canada  that ould  cause ur  own economy to  grow more slowly. e  need  to c o W keep  that  n  mind. In  that  ontext,  nflation  ould emain  moderate  in  the ear erm, nd  a i c i sh r n t a number of  factors  hould elp  to  keep  it n  line or he oreseeable ture.    would  not, owever, s h i f t f fu I h recommend  a  more significant ing.   am mindful  of  the  fact hat  ur  record n  forecasting eas I t o i growth  slowdowns has  not  been  overly ccurate  n  recent  ears,  nd  therefore  think e should a i y a I w be  cautious. s others  ave  mentioned,  2  is  growing  strongly.  o,  I  think   deliberate  se  in A h M S a ea policy ould  benefit  he  economy,  and I  would go cautiously rward ith  it. hank you,  Mr. w t fo w T Chairman.

I  don't  pend  a  whole lot f  time  worrying  about he evel f rices  n  the  equity s o t l o p i markets  because  I  think  he redit  arkets re  really  ore important  or he  economy as  a whole. t c m a m f t The spreads n  the  credit  arkets ere certainly  naturally ght  arlier  is  ear,  ut  the i m w un ti e th y b correction s  carried  hese preads ell eyond a  return  o  normalcy.  The current  preads re ha t s w b t s a very  wide  indeed,  nd they ndicate   my view  that e have  to  be  concerned n the  downside a i in w o that  isk version  ill ecome unduly  great.  The result uld  be  that  ot  only  would  the redit r a w b co n c markets  be  essentially vailable   firms hat ormally eal  with  banks, ut  the  banks una to t n d b themselves ight  in  this  nvironment ecome sufficiently k  verse hat  e could  get  a  credit m e b ris a t w crunch.  I  am not  forecasting  at,  ut   see  it s  a serious  ownside  risk  hat  e have  to  be th b I a d t w concerned  about.  I  think e have  to  be  extremely ttentive, ecially   the eserve  Banks with w a sp in R our  proximity  o  the anks  in  our  Districts,  whether hat  s  happening r  not. here  is o t b to t i o T n question  hat  n  the ecurities  rms nd  banks  with  which  I  am familiar,  e  executive  ice t i s fi a th v president   charge  of  marketing as  been  put  in  the loset  nd  the xecutive  ice resident in h c a e v p in

charge  of redit  s ow in  front  aking  harge. hat  is  good  development  as  long  as  it  oes  not c i n t c T a d get  into he  risk  version  rea o  a  point here a  credit unch  could ollow. t a a t w cr f

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  roaddus. B

MR.  BROADDUS. At  least  or he ime  being,  verall  conomic activity    our f t t o e in District mains t  a  very  high  level. evenue growth  in  the  broad  service-producing  ctor re a R se slowed  in  August  but  picked p  again n  September. here  was a  noticeable se  n  retail tivity u i T ri i ac essentially  ross he oard  in  September.  As in  many other  istricts, idential  nstruction ac t b D res co and  new home  sales  re  still ite trong  hroughout  ur  region. ore generally, r  contacts a qu s t o M ou indicate  hat here  as  been  no  perceptible sing n  the  extraordinarily ht  abor  arket t t h ea i tig l m conditions  e have  experienced  or any months. Workers with  even  minimal  job  skills e w f m ar hard  to ind n  many  areas. killed  onstruction rkers  are specially arce. e  had  a f i S c wo e sc W meeting  of ur  Small  Business nd  Agriculture visory  Council  last  eek and  they ere o a Ad w w particularly ect  n  describing  he  tight  abor  arket  conditions   their  espective dustries dir i t l m in r in and  areas.

That  said,  e are  now  seeing or he irst me  some unmistakable  igns f  softening w f t f ti s o in the  region's nufacturing  ector. anufacturing s  important  n  our  region.  special  ote:  A ma s M i i A n couple  of  components  on our  monthly  manufacturing  urvey,  amely  new orders nd  planned s n a capital  pending,  lowed  quite harply  n  August  and  September.  A number of  manufacturers, s s s i as in  other arts  f  the ountry,  ad  been  telling    about educed xports  nd  increased  ompetition p o c h us r e a c from  imports. ne especially gh  profile ample  of  a  change  in  sentiment  n  the O hi x i manufacturing  ector  as the  announcement  a  couple  of  weeks ago  by  Motorola  that  hey  are s w t going  to  suspend  construction   a  new $3 billion ip lant hat  as being  erected  ear on ch p t w n Richmond. That  is  a  big low to  our ocal ommunity. They did  not  announce  any  time  frame b l c for esuming  construction.    my view,  manufacturers  n  our  region ow clearly ve  the  sense r In i n ha

that hey  have  bigger roblems  and  that  hese roblems  may last  onger han hey ad  thought t p t p l t t h previously.

Turning  to  the  national onomy,  I  would  like  o  add a  note f aution,  nd  I  guess ec t o c a I am underlining me of  the hings  hat  ary Stern,  erry  ordan,  om  Hoenig, nd  others ave so t t G J J T a h said.  It s ertainly  ue hat  he verall  ational  icture  as  changed  quite adically    many i c tr t t o n p h r in ways over  the  last  ouple f  months.  As we all now, the  Russian  devaluation  nd  default, c o k a doubts  about  the  effectiveness   he  IMF, and  perhaps o  some extent    perceived  orld oft t a w leadership  eficit ve  produced  a quantum  jump in  risk  n  world  financial rkets.   think hat d ha i ma I t has  been a  seminal vent. ne can see  it n  the  data,  s  Bill cDonough e O i a M said,  nd  it s uite a i q dramatic.  The Salomon Brothers  pread  on Brady  bonds  over  U.S.  Treasuries,  r xample, s fo e increased  y  fully b 5-1/2 percentage  oints  etween  the nd  of uly nd  the  end  of  August.  That  is p b e J a not  much less han  the umulative ncrease  n  that pread ver  the  much longer eriod hen we t c i i s o p w were tightening licy ack  in  1994 and 1995. This  increased  inancial sk  s  significantly po b f ri i complicating  djustment  roblems  in  the  world  economy,  and in  the  United tates  t  robably a p S i p accounts or  good part f  the  decline  n  stock rices  nd  the  apparently  ighter nditions  n f a o i p a t co i loan  and  other redit  arkets. c m

I  certainly  ree hat  hese hocks  will ikely  ake  some of  the  steam  out  of omestic ag t t s l t d U.S.  demand. That  is  probably    good thing.  But  it s till clear  o  me how  sharp he ltimate a i s un t t u slowing  is  going  to e.  Even with  a  75 basis oint ecline  n  the unds ate uilt  nto  he b p d i f r b i t forecast,  e  Greenbook expects he eal DP  growth  rate  o  fall  o  only  1  percent  n  the  first  lf th t r G t t i ha of  next ear  and  then  to ise  nly  2  oint o  11/2  percent  n  the econd  half.  owever,  there till y r o 1/ p t i s H s is  no  really rd  evidence s  I  see  it hat he .S.  economic  expansion ither  s  or  will oon  slow ha a t t U e i s in  a  major  way. It ay happen.  Certainly,  e  downside  risks  re reater  han hey  were, ut t m th a g t t b i may not  happen. Labor  markets  are  still ght.  ages are ising.  onsumer confidence  s  down ti W r C i

from  its  eak, ut t ould op back  up  in  the ake of  any  easing ction e may take.  Also, he p b i c p w a w t rate f  growth  of 2  over he  last  8 months  or  so,  as  far s  I  am concerned,  till  nstitutes o M t 1 a s co an inflation  sk  n  the utlook. he most  recent  2  surge  probably oes  reflect  flight   liquidity, ri i o T M d a to but  the apid 2  growth  in  the arlier nths of his  ear  and  late  ast  ear id  not. This  latest r M e mo t y l y d bulge  could  well eflect   part he  prospective  olicy  asing hat  s ow  apparent  n ed  funds r in t p e t i n i f futures  ates. r

If e ease  policy ow, as  assumed in  the  Greenbook, n  reaction  o  events hat  any w n i t t m in  the  United tates  egard s  largely    foreign  roblem, e run  at  least  ome risk n  my view  of S r a a p w s i creating    perception  t ome point hat  ur  longer-term  rice  tability ective  as  changed or a a s t o p s obj h at  least  hat e are eing  distracted.  ere  is   risk hat  e may in  fact  e  distracted    some t w b Th a t w b to extent  rom  our  long-term  rice tability l.  I  think hat isk  s  heightened  y  the ightness f p s goa t r i b t in labor arkets  and the eneral trength  f he conomy. m g s o t e

The good news at  this  tage,  f ourse,  s hat  arkets ave  already  riced  n  much of s o c i t m h p i the  policy asing hat  s ssumed  in  the  projections.  yet, ond rates  ave  not  risen;  hey how e t i a As b h t s no increase  ue  to  heightened  nflation  pectations. r  now at  least, hink e still  ve  our d i ex Fo I t w ha credibility and it is  holding  p  well.  But  I  do  hope  we will atch  closely  s  we go  forward or u w a f any  evidence f roding ublic onfidence  n  our  commitment to  price tability e follow he o e p c i s if w t policy trategy  hat  s aid  ut  in  the reenbook. s t i l o G

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Ferguson.

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. For  much of  this ear,  s  others  ave y a h said,  e have  been  waiting or   financial set o  hit  ur  shores,  nd  it ooks s  though  that  s w f a up t o a l a i about  to  happen. While  many of s  have  migrated o  a  view  of  noticeably  eaker  growth, nd  I u t w a am among them,  I  think t's portant  o eiterate  o  realities  at  thers  ave  brought ut. i im t r tw th o h o First,   course,  his  eakness  is  forecast.  omestic  weakness  is ot  yet ere.  In  fact,  abor of t w a D n h l

markets,  s  others ave  said,  emain  tight.  necdotal vidence uggests  hat he emand for a h r A e s t t d workers  is till rong  n  some sectors.  DP  is ikely  o  grow at  or  above  trend or his uarter s st i G l t f t q and  the ext. he boost o  GDP  is  the  result   two things:  he  first,  viously,  he  return  f n T t of t ob ist o the  GM workers  and  the  second  is he  continued  trength   some interest-sensitive  ors  f he t s of sect o t economy. PCEjumped  as  consumers  purchased ore automobiles.  rders  for urable oods m O d g indicate  ontinued  ncreases  n  shipments nd  spending,  lbeit   lower  rates  han  in  the  first lf. c i i a a at t ha Retail ales eports  re  strong nd anecdotal  vidence ndicates  slowing  yet n  housing r s r a a e i no i o housing-related  rable oods. I  think   heard  a  little    that round  the able. here  clearly du g I of a t T remain  some risks  f igher  nflation,  ough  I  will gree  with  others  hat  hey ave  gone  down o h i th a t t h significantly.

On the  negative  ide,  mployment growth  is own further d  the  likely  mpact f s e d an i o international ancial rmoil as  become much clearer. r  me the  important  ource f fin tu h Fo s o potential akness  from  the  foreign  ide s ot  necessarily    the  traded  oods  sector  ven we s i n in g e though  that  ill ontinue  o  be  a  source f  drag  on domestic conomic  activity. at is ore w c t o e Wh m worrisome  in  my view  is  the  transmission   financial akness  abroad o  our  financial rkets of we t ma and  the esulting pact n the  investment  ehavior f  U.S.  businesses.   uess  it hould ot  be r im o b o Ig s n a  surprise at  eakness  will manate  from  the  investment  ctivities    firms fter    period hen th w e a of a a w growth  has  been  heavily  riven y  business  nvestment  pending. mportantly  or e, a  lot f d b i s I f m o this nvestment  pending rom  corporations s  been maintained uring his  eriod y  both  cash i s f ha d t p b flow  and  leverage.  e  have  not  talked  uch about  it n  this  oom,  but  I  believe  hat  onfinancial W m i r t n corporate  ebt  grew at  an annual ate f bout  12 percent  n  the  first lf f his  ear. he d r o a i ha o t y T difference tween  capital  pending nd  internally  nerated  unds,  hat many call  he inancing be s a ge f w t f gap,  is   believe  t ts  ighest  evel ince  he ecession  f  1982.  This  approach o  corporate I a i h l s t r o t investment, ich includes  oth  cash  flow  and  leverage, kes such  investment  articularly wh b ma p

vulnerable  o  changes  in  financial nditions,  ychology,  nd  profit ospects, l f  which we t co ps a pr al o have  experienced  ecently. r

I  agree ith  Vice  Chair cDonough w M that  he  vehicle  or his  eakness  is ot urely t f t w n p stock  market  effects ere we in  fact ad  expected ome deterioration.   greater portance o wh h s Of im t me is  the  fact  hat t  s ore  broadly entered  n  credit  arkets. e  have  heard rom  the taff t i i m c i m W f s that  he  syndicated  oan  market  appears o  have  become less ccommodating,  and  that  s ausing t l t a i c some banks  to  pull ack  to  some extent rom  lending.    am concerned  that  f  hat  educed b f I i t r willingness   lend  is ombined with  significant  creases  n  the ost f apital  rom  the  stock to c in i c o c f market, e will ace  real isk  f  serious  apital-raising  straints.  ke  Vice  Chair w f a r o c con Li McDonough,  I  am not  predicting  credit  runch,  ut  I  am mindful hat  t s ot  out  of  the ealm a c b t i i n r of  possibility. lso eems  likely  hat   slowdown in  credit-driven iness  nvestment  ill ead It a s t a bus i w l to  slower rowth  in  job  incomes  and  wealth-driven nsumption.  Thus  far his  ear g co t y consumption  has  surprised  s  on the  upside,  riven y  tight bor arkets  and  by  high  equity u d b la m values. t eems,  though, hat  oth  of  these  actors  ave  begun  to  unravel r  will hortly  so. I s t b f h o s do Equity arkets  already ave  done  so.  Labor  markets ill djust  radually  ver ime. m h w a g o t

For  me the  final  uestion  s hat  the  reaction  f his  ommittee should e.  As others q i w o t C b have  indicated,  e  international e eems unlikely  o  settle fficiently  sufficiently ckly th sid s t su or qui to  alter  he  scenario.  o other  ajor  economic  power  seems capable f  engendering  he rowth t N m o t g of  demand that e need  to  maintain ear-term  rend rowth  in  our  country. ut  like  resident w n t g B P Boehne and  others,    believe  hat  ny  monetary  policy  djustment  hat  omes out f ur  meeting I t a a t c o o today  should e  done  very udiciously.  ere  are  some elements f  strength   the conomy. b j Th o in e The downside  risks  re  still ite  igh, ut  we could  again e  surprised   the pside.   for ne a qu h b b on u I o do not  think e are  yet ehind he urve.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Gramlich.

MR. GRAMLICH. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. Coming late  n  this  iscussion,  ere i d th is  not  too uch  to  say  that  as  not een  said any times lready. hat  is he  good news. I m h b m a T t would point ut  that  here  as  been  a quite mportant  hange  in  the eneral omments of he o t h i c g c t Reserve  Bank presidents   the  past everal  eetings,  hough  maybe not  a sea  change.  My  own in s m t forecast,  ch  as  it  s,  s airly ose o  the reenbook;  I  am roughly n  agreement ith  the su i i f cl t G i w Greenbook scenario.  While  it s  true hat  ore is  influencing e lowdown than  the  stock i t m th s market,    think here s  an important  oint o  be  made about he  stock arket  that  as  not  been I t i p t t m h brought  out  today.  That  is,  f  e look t orecasts   earnings  y  the  so-called ock arket i w a f of b st m analysts,  ey  would still    on the  high  side y  all easures.  What seems  to  happen  in  the ay th be b m w these orecasts e  put  together   that s  disappointing  mbers come in, s  they ave  recently, f ar is a nu a h the  current  uarter   downgraded  but  not he  future  uarters.  here  is till  lot f hat  oing n. q is t q T s a o t g o I  think  he reenbook  is  on solid  round  in  anticipating  urther  ecline  n  stock rices  nd  a t G g a f d i p a feedback n the  real conomy through he  consumption  wealth  effect. o e t

One concept  that  e have  not  talked  bout uch this  orning  is AIRU. w a m m N I  think  hat t if  e are  coming  out n  the irection   an  easing ove, as  it eems to  me most  people re, e w i d of m s a w should  at  least  o through   mental  test  n why we are  doing  so  when we have  an  unemployment g a o rate hat  s itting   -1/2  percent. any  of  you have  addressed  he act hat  ou see  very  little t i s at4 M t f t y evidence f  accelerating  flation.   the  TIP  premium that  e talked  bout  earlier,   view is o in On w a my that  hile  liquidity  eferences d  transaction  sts ay account  for ome of he  TIP  premium, w pr an co m s t I  think  here s ome information  here s  well, amely  that  t  eflects  general owngrading  of t i s t a n i r a d inflation  rries. o,  with  regard o  the AIRU,  I  guess  the  story  n  inflation  uld  be  a wo S t N o wo combination f  things.  n the  one  hand, hose ho think  he AIRU o O t w t N is  -1/2  percent  r 5 o thereabouts y be  a  little  f n that  stimate. he other spect,  owever,  is hat ven  in  the ma of o e T a h t e Greenbook  forecast ere s  projected  o e  a  rise  n he nemployment rate. h i t b i t u

All  of his  ogether  dds  up  to   recommendation  on my part or asing  s  we have t t a a f e a previously  iscussed.    think he ain question  s  whether o  ease  a  lot r  a little.  e d I t m i t o Th arguments  are  actually cely  ade in  the  Bluebook,  and  I  will ot  repeat  hem. I  will  ust  ay ni m n t j s that here  I  come out  on that ssue  s  that    am for autious  ase.  One reason s  that    believe  e w i i I c e i I w are  still ead  of  the urve n  terms  of  managing  the eal conomy. I  don't  hink  here s   sense ah c i r e t t i a in  which,  if  e  just  ook  at he  real conomy,  we can  be  described  s  being oo  late  r  behind he w l t e a t o t curve.  Dave Stockton ointed ut  that here till e  upside isks  nd  we should eep  those n p o t s ar r a k i mind. I  think hat  l  Broaddus  made a  good point hen he  said hat  f e go  too  far t his t A w t i w a t meeting, t ight  look  as  if  e have  become distracted  om  what  should e  our undamental i m w fr b f goal  of ealing ith  inflation.  e  certainly uld  not  want  to  send  out  that  essage.  The last d w W wo m point,  hich  others ave  made,  is hat    big ove  at his  oint ight  be  misinterpreted    a w h t a m t p m as degree  of  panic n our  part.  t ould  be  at  a  minimum  very  un-Fed-like,  d  we certainly  uld o I w an wo not  want that.

MR.  MEYER. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  What has  changed  between  the  last meeting  and  today  that  ould ustify    easing?  That  clearly  he  question  f  the  day.  The c j an ist o answer  is ot  the  initial  nditions,    terms f  very  tight  abor  arkets,  or  the ear-term  ace n co in o l m n n p of  the xpansion.  Second-half  DP  growth  still oks o  be  close o  trend,  t  least  o y  estimate e G lo t t a t m of  trend. hat  is, f  course,    significant  owdown relative    the  rate  f  growth  in  the irst lf, T o a sl to o f ha but  it  s n  line  ith  earlier pectations d it  ill eave abor arkets till ry  tight  t he  end i i w ex an w l l m s ve a t of  this  ear. or  do  I ee  anything  n  the ost  recent ata elating   the  strength  f he y N s i m d r to o t expansion o ustify  change  in  policy. he forecast?  ell,  that's  different ory nd  that s t j a T W a st a i my point. ny policy  ction oday  must  be  based  squarely  n and  be  defended n  terms  of he A a t o i t forecast  or 999,  specifically the  change  in  that orecast stified    recent evelopments. f 1 on f ju by d The staff  id  an excellent b  of  identifying  d  quantifying e  effects  f hree ecent d jo an th o t r developments.

The first   the  downward  revision  o  foreign  rowth  due  importantly   a  downward is t g to revision  n  growth  prospects  or atin merica.  The second  is he  sharper-than-anticipated i f L A t decline  n  equity  rices  hat uggests    downward revision   consumer  spending nd quite  ikely i p t s a to a l to  business  ixed nvestment  nd residential  nstruction    well.  The third  s  a  widening  of isk f i a co as i r spreads nd  a  generally  educed ppetite  or isk  hat ight  well  have  an  incrementally verse a r a f r t m ad effect  n spending. aking  the  direct  mpacts f he  first o, dding  a  smidgen for he  difficult o T i o t w a t to  quantify  atter ctor, d  then  applying n appropriate ltiplier  ts e to  something n  the l fa an a mu ge m i range  of  a 3/4 percentage  oint ownward  revision  o  my growth  forecast r 999,  albeit  rom  a p d t fo 1 f somewhat higher nitial  recast an  that n  the  last  reenbook. i fo h i G

The change  in  the orecast n  perhaps  best e  understood  y  differentiating  t f ca b b wha I call hase  two  of  the lobal urmoil  rom  phase  one.  I  date hase  two  from  the ussian p g t f p R

moratorium  and  devaluation  nd  the  increased  ressure  n  Latin merican  economies  that a p o A immediately ollowed.  nterestingly,  se  two  does  not  appear o  have  an  especially verse f I pha t ad effect  n erms  of  its  ncremental  ffect  n net xports,  ertainly en compared to  the  effect  f i t i e o e c wh o the  crises  mong developing sian  economies  and  the  deterioration  the apanese conomy a A f J e during  phase  one.  However,  whereas  phase  one  was accompanied  by  offsetting  sitive ocks po sh in  the orm  of ower  U.S.  interest  tes  temming  from  safe-haven  apital  lows  and lower il f l ra s c f o prices,  hase  two  in  contrast  ccompanied  by  the  reinforcing  verse ffects   a  decline  n p isa ad e of i equity rices  nd  an increase  n  risk preads s  well  as  by  a  coincidental crease  n  oil rices  ue p a i s a in i p d to  supply utbacks.  second  likely  ifference   that  hereas  phase  one  was accompanied  by  an c A d is w unexpected nd largely  nexplained  urge  in  private  omestic emand,  phase  two will ikely a u s d d l be accompanied  by  a spontaneous nwinding  of  that  xceptional rength. u e st

I  have  emphasized  previously e  distinction  tween  central  endencies  nd th be t a asymmetric  risks  n  the urrent  orecast,  d I  believe  his spect f  the utlook  s  also elevant i c f an t a o o i r to  the olicy  ecision.    have  to  admit hat  hen I  hear omeone say  that  he isks  n  their p d I t w s t r i forecast  re  asymmetric, y first clination    to  encourage hem to ethink  hat orecast d a m in is t r t f an return  hen they  have  managed to  produce  one  where  the isks  re  symmetric.   believe  ur w r a I o staff  as  followed his  hilosophy  ore than  most  forecasters.  ey  assume,  for xample, h t p m Th e a break  in  Brazil's  change  rate egime  and  a  fairly  harp djustment  n  growth  in  Latin merica, ex r s a i A and they  have  a  further cline  n  the  stock arket  on top f  the ecent  orrection. vertheless, de i m o r c Ne when there  re  potentially  portant  ne-sided  iscontinuities  he  outlook,   I  believe  here a im o d in  t as t are  today,  isks  an  legitimately    asymmetric.  As a result,  ere  ould e an  important r c be th c b difference tween  the  modal forecast--the t uess  and  the  most  likely  utcome--and he be bes g o t mean of  the  probability  stribution  outcomes. Both  are  relevant   the  policy  ecision. di f to d

On balance ecause y previous  orecast  or  1999 was not  as  pessimistic    that  n  the b m f f as i August  Greenbook,  I  end  up with  a somewhat higher rowth  forecast r 999,  even  allowing or g fo 1 f a  similar wnward  revision  o  growth.  But  I  do  expect rowth  to e  decidedly  elow  trend ext do t g b b n year.  Given  my  expectation   somewhat faster owth  than  in  the  Greenbook and  therefore of gr a slightly  wer  path  for he  unemployment rate,    anticipate it  igher nflation  an  is rojected lo t I a  b h i th p in  the reenbook. However,  I  agree he eaker  growth  now in  prospect  nd  the  projected sing G t w a ri path  of he  unemployment rate hould estrain flation  ing  forward. he policy uestion, t s r in go T q of course,  s  whether he  projected  lowdown crosses  he  line rom  benign  to  undesirable.  will i t s t f I save  that ssessment  or y policy tatement. a f m s

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you very  much. Let's  ow move on to  Don n Kohn.

MR. KOHN. At  your  conference  all  ast  eek,  most  of  you  seemed to c l w favor asing olicy  t  this eeting.  I  will  riefly view he  case  for n e p a m b re t a easing  ction efore iscussing e  factors  earing  n how large he  cut  in a b d th b o t the  federal  unds  rate  hould e. f s b

The case  for asing oes  not  rest  n  incoming  data bout  the conomy. e d o a e As many of  you have  noted,  he  information  hat as  become available nce t t h si your  last  eeting  indicates at he conomy continues  o  expand  at  a  pace m th t e t around  the  growth  rate f  its  otential. at  has  kept he nemployment o p Th t u rate lat  t  a  very  low level, d  inflation  s  edged  higher  n a 12-month f a an ha o basis,  t  least  s  measured  by  the ore PI. Thus,  a standard, ckwarda a c C ba looking aylor ule hat alled  or  5-1/2  percent  ederal  unds  rate  n  August T r t c f a f f i would  continue  o  do  so  today. t

Rather,  he ase  for asing elies  projections at  ave  been  marked t c e r on th h down by developments verseas nd  in  U.S.  financial rkets.  Most o a ma significantly,    sea  change  in  investors'  rceptions  f isk  nd  their the pe o r a apparent eightened  nwillingness   take hose isks  as  continued  o h u to t r h t spread lobally, tting e  Americas  with  greater  ntensity.  nancial g hi th i Fi conditions  ave  become more restrictive oughout  he  hemisphere, h thr t especially   our  important  xport arkets n  Latin merica  and  Canada in e m i A where  the  authorities  ve  had  to  tighten  onetary olicy  o  defend heir ha m p t t currencies.

While Committee  members may have  had  stronger  conomic  forecasts e than  the  staff,   s ikely  hat  ost  of our  projections  so ave  been iti l t m y al h reduced  noticeably  y  these  vents. n  that  ase, f ou considered  he b e I c i y t federal  unds  rate  o  be  at  an  appropriate vel n  August, t robably hould f t le i i p s be  lower  now. Even if  ommittee  members had  not  marked down their C forecasts   the  most  probable utcome  for conomic  growth  by very of o e much--or  only y enough to  become more  comfortable  ith  the  inflation b w outlook--the wer  tail  f he  distribution oubtedly as  gotten   good  bit lo o t und h a fatter.   that  egard,  he  Committee might  see  these s  the ppropriate In r t a a circumstances  n  which to  take ome risks  n  the ide f  trying  o nsure i s o s o t e that  .S.  economic  growth  comes close o eing  as  robust  s  possible, U t b a consistent th  continued  ow inflation.  olonged luggish  xpansion n wi l Pr s e i the  United tates  ould  seriously dermine  recovery rospects  n  the  rest S w un p i of  the orld  and  eventually ed  back  on our  own  economy. w fe

Much  of  the enefits  f  an  easing ove was realized r inancial b o m fo f markets  when expectations me to  embody action oday. hat  process ca t T helped  to evel ut  risk  preads n  some domestic arkets  and  to educe l o s i m r spreads n Brady  and other  ollar-denominated  vereign  onds  on o d so b international  pital  arkets. t  probably lso as  helped o  halt  he  drop  in ca m I a h t t equity rices  fter  heir  harp all  n  August.  Failing  o  follow p  by p a t s f i t u actually  asing  ould  undo much  of hat. e c t

To be  sure,  t  s mportant  ot  to e, r  to e  seen  as, ttempting  o i i i n b o b a t support articular  lues n  capital  arkets.  good  part f he arket p va i m A o t m adjustment,  t  least  n  the  United tates, obably as  reflected propriate a i S pr h ap reassessments  f usiness  isks  nd  prospects.  nd in  some markets,  uch o b r a A s as  that  or .S.  equities,  e eappraisal  y not e  complete. ut  the f U th r ma b B Federal eserve  can  try o  keep  the  real conomy on  an  even  keel s R t e a financial rket  adjustments  re  made,  and  the ommittee  may see  that ma a C objective  s  now  requiring me reduction  n  a  real ederal  unds ate hat a so i f f r t had been  kept  at  an  unusually  igh  level n  part ecause  of inancial rket h i b f ma exuberance.

A cautious  pproach  to  easing,  haracterized   a  25 basis  oint a c by p reduction  n  the ederal  unds ate,  ight  be  justified the ituation  w i f f r m by s no prevailing   the  economy.  With  the  unemployment rate  ell  below  most in w estimates  f ts  ustainable  vel,  he  Committee  has  long  been  of he iew o i s le t t v that  conomic growth  needed  to  slow  substantially m  the  pace  of he ast e fro t l few years--most  ikely   below trend--just  keep  inflation  om l to to fr accelerating.   yet, here  re  few signs hat  he  economy already s As t a t t i slowing  enough to  begin  to  relieve bor arket  pressures, ch less  hat t la m mu t i is  decelerating    sharply  s  clearly   require  onetary  policy  asing. so a to m e Inflation  sks  ssociated th  the  tight  abor arket  are  heightened  y  the ri a wi l m b possibility t ome of  the  factors  amping  price ncreases  n  recent  ears ha s d i i y may already  e  reversing--the  llar  s alling ainst  urrencies  f  other b do i f ag c o industrial  untries,  alth are osts re  rising  aster,  d  oil  rices ave co he c c a f an p h

Caution  in  not  moving the  federal  unds  rate  y  very  much also ay be f b m seen  as  consistent th  basing he ction  rimarily  n projections  ther wi t a p o ra than  actual  ata,  articularly ce t s ifficult  be  confident  bout  the d p sin i i d to a effects  f  a  change  in  the  ederal  unds ate n  the urrent  ighly kittish o f f r i c h s financial rket  environment. o be  sure,   series  f ightenings    1994 ma T a o t in was initiated  rgely  n the asis f rojections,   the  Committee  waited la o b o p but until  t as sure he  economy was strong,  nd  much  of  the  subsequent i w t a policy  irmings  ccurred gainst  he ackground  of  surprisingly  bust f o a t b ro growth  and early igns f  rising  nflation  essures.  he analogous trategy s o i pr T s at  this  ime ight  be  to  begin ith  a  small ction nd  build  n it hould t m w a a o s further  evelopments n  either  he  financial rkets r  the  economy indicate d i t ma o that  he  shock  to  spending as in  fact urning  ut  to  be  substantial. t w t o

Lastly,  olding he  action  o  25 basis oints  ay have  some appeal f h t t p m i the  Committee  thought oth  that he  act f  easing  n  any  amount would b t o i itself  efully  eassure  inancial rkets,  ouseholds,  nd  businesses  hat us r f ma h a t the  Federal eserve  recognized  nd was responding  o  potential oblems R a t pr and  that  n  total t  much easing ould  ultimately   necessary  o  support i no w be t adequate conomic  expansion. n  these ircumstances,  relatively  dest e I c a mo action  ow would be  desirable   that  ne  or  more further sings  ould  be n so o ea c undertaken  n  response o  changing onditions  ithout isking  xcessive i t c w r e stimulus  o  growth  and a potential tensification  nflation  essures. t in of  i pr

Reducing  the ederal  unds  rate y 50 basis  oints  ight  be  appropriate f f b p m if  he  Committee  instead  aw  the  situation    one  that  equired,   was t s as r or highly ikely  ventually  o  require, bstantial  licy asing. n  the  staff l e t su po e I forecast, ecrease n  the  federal  unds  rate f  75 basis oints  s eeded  to a  d i f o p i n keep  the conomy from dropping elow the  level f  its  otential   the  year e b o p in 2000.

While the ost  likely  utcome  is hat  redit  onditions ll nd  up  only m o t c c wi e moderately ess ccommodative,  recent  inancial rket  developments l a f ma suggest  hat he  odds  may have  increased  f  significant  rther ghtening t t o a fu ti in  credit  vailability h  associated wnside  risks  o  the conomy. a wit o t e Questions bout  the  financial undness  of  a  number of  financial rms ave a so fi h intensified    the  wake of he ear  failure   Long-Term Capital in t n of Management.

Second,  the atest ta  indicate  fairly amatic ecline  n  construction ards  for l da a dr d i aw nonresidential  ilding. eyond that,  e do not  find ignificant  akening  in  equipment  orders. bu B w s we Retail  ales re  not errific,   obviously hey  are ot  doing  too adly. otor  vehicles, ich s a t but t n b M wh are  a  crucial  actor,  e  softening    little  t ardly nough to ake ote. ctually,  he  ratio  f f ar a bu h e t n A t o used  car  prices  o ew car  prices, ich has  not een a bad  short-term dicator,  s  turned p a t n wh b in ha u little.  mebuilding  may be off    bit,  ut  it s till ite levated  y  any  objective asure.  So, Ho a b i s qu e b me as  we look  across  he  board, t s ery  hard  to  find ny  indicators  ignificant  ftening.  be t i i v a ofs so To sure,  he  labor  arket  is xceptionally  ght, though e have  had  a  modest  increase  n  insured t m e ti al w i unemployment.  It  popped  up  with  the M G strike  nd  did  not everse  ully  fter  he trike  as a r f a t s w settled.  might  add  that  he  low  level f nitial  aims elative    insured  nemployment I t o i cl r to u probably eflects clines  n  both  hires  nd  layoffs  n  relation  he  number of  employed r de i a i tot workers.  That  is  showing  up,  incidentally, he ousehold ata s  well.  A more  relevant in  t h d a indication   a weakening  labor arket  would be  an upturn n  the evel f  insured of m i l o unemployment. That  level as  risen    little  t  scarcely  nough to  argue hat e are eeing h a bu e t w s a significant  velopment. de

The  crucial  evelopment,  hich has  been  mentioned  numerous times round  this d w a table,   that  e are  observing  n  important  hift  n  attitudes  ward isk.  he  reason s hat  ne is w a s i to r T i t o can generalize d  explain  he usiness  ycle,  erhaps n  an  overly implistic  y,  as  reflecting an t b c p i s wa shifting ews  toward  risk.  hen  there  s  a  general ense f eclining  isk,  here  s   tendency o vi W i s o d r t i a t reach  out  into he uture.  hat  is  another  ay of aying hat  he  cyclically  nsitive  eas f he t f T w s t t se ar o t economy--capital  nvestment,  onstruction,  nsumer  durables--all elerate   the  result i c co acc as of efforts  o  invest  n  the uture.  he downside  of he ycle ccurs hen there s   widespread t i f T t c o w i a perception  f  rising  isks. o r

We  would certainly  pect o  see  a  change  in  psychology efore ny  significant ex t b a erosion  n  the eal ariables   the  economy became apparent. uch a  change  in  psychology i r v of S clearly  s hat  we are  observing.  he opening  up of isk  preads s  very  significant  dication i w T r s i a in of  increased  isk  version.  s we know,  that  eans in  effect  hat  ommitments are eing ulled r a A m t c b p back.  We  see  in  the alance heet ata hat re ow emerging  and  that overnor  Ferguson  was b s d t a n G referencing  fairly  ronounced  weakening  of ash  flows n  the  business  ector  oupled ith  an a p c i s c w ever-increasing  fficulty    raising pital  xternally. di of ca e

If e have  a  contraction    both  internal d  external  ources f  funds,  he uestion w in an s o t q then  arises  s  to  how the  momentum a will e  maintained  n  the  capital  oods  markets,    sector  f b i g a o the  economy that  as  been  an important  actor  n  the ignificant  pansion f conomic  activity h f i s ex o e in  recent  ears.  So,  what  we should e  looking or,  nd  indeed hat  is  implicit   the  Greenbook y b f a w in forecast,     process y  which the ombination f  increased  isk version  n  the arket, isa b c o r a i m reflecting  anged  attitudes  ward  the  future, d  the ffects  f igher erceived  isks  n  the ch to an e o h p r o balance  sheets  f usiness  irms ll oint n  a  single  irection. at  is,  hey uggest    decline  n o b f a p i d Th t s a i capital  nvestment.  rom the  perspective   the  way our  models  operate,  he eason ould  be i F of t r w that he  cost f apital  as  gone  up.  In  terms  of hat  actually  appening n  the eal orld, he t o c h w ish i r w t reason s asically at  eople  are  pulling  ack, nd  those ho are  not  pulling  ack  are inding  t i b th p b a w b f i difficult    finance heir  ctivities her  nternally    externally. to t a eit i or

I  was  mentioning n  a short  onversation ring ur  coffee reak hat    suspect  hat  f i c du o b t I t i we had  September  capital  ppropriations  ta or orporations,   would see  a  fairly  ignificant a da f c we s decline.  hat  would  be  the  first rd vidence n  the orward ata.  We  do  not  see  any  general T ha e i f d weakness  in  the  order ooks  thus ar. e  do  in  steel  here  imports ave  caused teel  ndustry b f W w h s i orders o  collapse, t hat  s  specialized  dustry  ffect  nd  we do  not  yet ave  indications t bu t i a in e a h of

I  believe  hat he  stock arket  decline  as  had  a very rofound  effect,  d  indeed ne t t m h p an o can  argue hat   goodly  part f  the  increased  isk  version  s tself onsequence  of  the ollapse t a o r a i i a  c c in  stock arket  values. s best   can  judge,  hat  ollapse  s  not ll hat  uch  a  result   a m A I t c i a t m of contraction   earnings xpectations,    least  n the  part f  security alysts.  t learly  ar in e at o o an I c isf more the  result  f ising  iscount  actors  gainst  hose arnings  n  the  sense f  a  rise  n  equity o r d f a t e i o i premiums,  as  least  s  we measure  them. What that  ndicates    foreshortening   orward  time a i isa off preferences  r, ooked  at  another  ay,  an  increase  n  risk  version. o,  in  one  sense o l w i a S differentiating  ity  arkets  and  the  credit rkets s ot  something hat  s ery  meaningful equ m ma i n t i v because  both  very  much reflect e  same underlying  rocess f ulling  ack. h p o p b

As I  indicated  arlier,  e  approximately  3  trillion  pital ss n  the  aggregate  alue e th $ ca o i v of  equities   the  United  States, st  of  which are eld  by  U.S.  residents,  st  annot e in mo h ju c b occurring  ithout onsiderable eakage  of  crockery  omewhere. A stock arket  decline f he w c br s m o t magnitude  we have  experienced  robably as far ess  ignificant   or  30 years  ago  than  it s p w l s 20 i today.  This  is argely  ecause he  aggregate  ize f  stock oldings  elative   income  is  so  much l b t s o h r to higher ow and so  many more people  have  equity nvestments  hat  he  effects  f tock arket n i t t o s m declines  n economic  choices s  almost urely  igher.  learly,  ur  exposure o  stock arket o i s h C o t m developments s  much greater  han  it s n  Europe. i t i i

In  any  event,    think  hat  hat  we are bserving  s  development hat  s ccurring  t I t w o i a t i o a the  fulcrum  of  a  turn,  or ant of  better  xpression,    the sychology f  anticipatory f w a e in p o evaluations at ill e  reflected   some point n  hard  numbers relating    the  performance f th w b at i to o the  economy itself. hink,  owever,  that  t  s  a  mistake o  expect he atter  appen  very I  t h i i t t l toh quickly. he economy's  momentum T in  1997 and  the irst arter  f  1998  and  the ig  surge n f qu o b i

stock arket  values n  the irst lf  f  this  ear  are  all orking  their  ay through he ncome  and m i f ha o y w w t i product ccounts.   would be very  surprised  o  see  that  omentum a I t m disappear  n  the  near erm.

Therefore,  presumption hat  e are  going  to  see  a  significant t a a t w effect  n capital penditures  efore 999 is  probably nrealistic. o ex b 1 u

Nonetheless,  t ould  be  wrong to  say  that  he  change  in  psychology s ll phemeral i w t i a e just  ecause  we have  not  seen  it n  the  hard ata et. n  the orecast ocess,  e have  to ook  at b i d y I f pr w l people's  alue udgments. t  is he  change  in  value udgments hat lters e eal orld.  We v j I t j t a th r w have  evidence hat hose alue udgments  are  changing n  a  very  significant  y,  and that  s o t t v j i wa i n longer   forecast.  s a  consequence,  e are  likely  o  see  this  rocess ontinue nd  perhaps a A w t p c a accelerate.

I  thought he vidence f  fairly despread ightening   the  senior  oan  officers t e o wi t in l survey as quite tartling    terms  of ts  iscontinuity h  bank  lending  ractices   the  previous w s in i d wit p in survey. e  picked  up  indications    that  t  our  meeting ith  the ederal dvisory ouncil W of a w F A C several  eeks ago,  well  before he atest an fficers' rvey as conducted. hat was w t l lo o su w W extraordinary   ow  depressed  hat roup  was. None of  them was saying hat heir  oans ere ish t g t t l w declining.  one of  them was saying hat  heir  ocal conomies  were experiencing  major N t t l e a contraction. t  the  essential nclusion  s hat he isks  eally  re  perceived  s  having  increased Bu co i t t r r a a in  a  way that    had  not  seen  arlier,  d  that  onclusion  s ow being olidified  the  senior  oan I e an c i n s in l officers'  rvey, hich  is  far  roader nd  more detailed. su w b a

What we are  seeing  n  our  financial rkets  is ssentially  irror  mage  of inancial i ma e a  m i f developments  abroad, ncluding    remarkable imilarity    timing. he concurrence  etween i a s in T b developments  here  as  measured  by  domestic ield preads nd  the ramatic vents broad  as y s a d e a

measured  by the  weighted rady  stripped  preads ndicates at  e are  not  currently serving B s i th w ob a lead/lag  henomenon.  In  effect, e  same contagion hat  as  so  gripped  he  rest f he  world  is p th t h t o t spilling er  to  our  economy. We  are  becoming  infected. is  is  evidenced y a  widening  of ov Th b domestic  yield preads. s

I  come out  of  all f his  ith  a  set f onclusions  r  probabilistic luations at o t w o c o eva th suggest o  me that  he  Greenbook  is ssentially  the  right  ath. ut  I  do  think hat  e have  to t t e on p B t w be careful  o  recognize  hat  ield  preads hat  an  become dramatically verse lso an  work t t y s t c ad a c their  ay back  toward  previous orms. We  have  seen  several  pikes n  the  international ipped w n s i str Brady  data  that ave  involved eversals.  be sure,  his  ne  is   much more deeply eated ne, h r To t o a s o and  it as  spilled er  to  the nited  States. owever,  we cannot resume  that  he  process  f h ov U H p t o deterioration    100  percent rrevocable. at  defies  istory.  he probability    a  substantial is i Th h T of reversal  t  this  tage s,   think,  ess  han  50/50,  ut t  s y  no  means zero.  Therefore, ose ho a s i I l t b i i b th w have  urged  a  degree f  caution  n  moving the  funds ate  ower, n  keeping ith  the  tentative o i r l i w decision  uring  our elephone  onference ast  eek to  move  at his eeting,  ave  the  best ase  as d t c l w t m h c far s  I  am concerned. a

Accordingly,    would suggest   reduction  f 5 basis  oints  n  the  federal  unds  rate I a o 2 p i f and  not  50  basis oints.    think hat  here s   better  rgument  for   tilt ward  ease  in  that  he p I t t i a a a to t latter s  somewhat greater  upport  n  terms  of he  historical  perience. onetheless,   s ha s i t ex N it i conceivable  hat e may end up viewing his  ction  ot  as  the irst   a series  f  moves but  as  an t w t a n f in o insurance  remium,  as  Governor  Kelley  pointed  ut. f hat utcome  is elt  o  be  more likely, p o I t o f t then  the rgument  for ymmetry is  more compelling. 'm ot  sure he  tilt   ll hat ritical    this a s I n t isa t c at stage ecause   think vents re  going  to  drive s  far ore than  our  predispositions his b I e a u m at t meeting.  I  would be  less nclined  o ase  our  future  ctions  n whatever e conclude t  this i t b a o w a stage han  I  would on  what  I  might  see  in  a  newspaper, ay, wo weeks from  today hat  eported t s t t r

on significant  velopments ver  the  next ouple f  weeks. So,  I  don't  hink hat  he ilt  oing de o c o t t t t isg to  matter ll hat uch.  The  reason  is hat  n  my  view  this  conomy is ither  oing  to  weaken a t m t i e e g further  s  a  consequence f he  very  significant  ift ward  greater  isk  version  nd  very  large a o t sh to r a a capital  osses  n  our  equity  arkets r  it  s oing  to  stabilize.  azil  ay suddenly ook  better; l i m o i g Br m l Latin  America  more generally  ay look etter;  e may get  a  further cline  n  the rady  yield m b w de i B spreads,  hich we have  seen  in  the  last  ew days; unk  issues  ay suddenly ook  a lot ess w f j m l l uninteresting  the  American  market.  In  other ords,  we cannot ule ut  the ossibility t  t in w r o p ha a some point he  economic outlook ay look  far ore like  he  August  Greenbook projections  d t m m t an what  we discussed  t  the  August  meeting han  it as  in  the ast  ew weeks. My  own impression a t h l f is  that conomic  conditions e  eroding t  this  oint.   do  not elieve  e are  behind he  curve e ar a p I b w t because  I  think ecent  conomic developments re  to  a very  large  xtent hat  we were r e a e w anticipating. s  not  as  though  there s  shock  element  involved. Iti i a

You may remember that  n  Jackson ole a  number of  us  got  together  nd  expressed i H a the  hope  that  e would  be  able o  wait  until  oday's eting  to  take hatever ction as w t t me w a w consistent th  developments n  our  domestic conomy. We  did  not  want  to  be  seen  as  rushed wi i e into ction  y  events xternal  o  the  United  States  nd  associated rket  forces.  e  felt  hat a b e t a ma W t having  to  move earlier an  today  would  clearly  seen  as  evidence f   central  ank  that  as th be o a b w scurrying  o  catch p.  We  have  succeeded n  staying  n schedule,  f    may use  that  erm, nd t u i o i I t a hopefully  e will ontinue  o  do so. w c t

Accordingly,    am putting  n the able    proposal o  reduce he  federal  unds ate I o t a t t f r immediately y  25 basis oints  nd  a  recommendation  that  e move to  asymmetry toward  ease. b p a w I  would  add  that y preference  or   tilt    that  irection   a  lot ess trong  han hat  I  see  as  the m f a in d is l s t w desirability  a  clear  ction  o ove the ate  own  by  25 basis oints.  ice  Chairman. of a t m r d p V

MS. MINEHAN. Mr. Chairman,  I  agree ith  your  recommendation  for   25 basis w a point  ut.  I  would  be  more comfortable  ith  a  symmetric  directive   his oint imply ecause c w att p s b I think  e still e  not, s  you point ut, eeing  eal vidence f  a slowing omestic xpansion. f w ar a o s r e o d e I the  reality   a  rate  ut, s  opposed  to  its  romise, esults    calmer arkets--and  on Kohn of c a p r in m D suggested  hat  hey  have  calmed  a  little  recent  ays--we ay see  a  shorter  ather  han  longer t t in d m r t a period f  market  turmoil  nd  a  return  o  an  economic situation  sembling  he ne that  e had  in o a t re t o w August.  At  that  oint,  he omestic conomy was still splaying  good deal  of  strength, d  we p t d e di a an had some concerns n the  upside s  well  as  the  downside.  So,  I  would be  significantly avor o a in  f of  a  symmetric  directive,  ven  that    am not  entirely  nvinced hat  he conomy is eaded gi I co t t e h down an  irrevocably ippery  lope.   say  that  espite  he  fact  hat  he arket urmoil  s sl s I d t t t m t i significant  d  the verreaction   credit  arkets as  been  much  greater  han  we anticipated an o in m h t at the  August  meeting.

MS. RIVLIN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  too  agree ith  your  recommendation  of  a  25 basis w point eduction.  n  my view,  a  larger  ove is nnecessary, d  it  ikely  ould  be  interpreted r I m u an l w as evidence hat  he ed  must  really  e  worried.   don't  hink e want  to  convey  that  mpression. t t F b I t w i I would also oncur  with  the roposed  downward tilt    the  directive spite  he  discussion at  e c p in de t th w had at  the eginning f ur  meeting  this  orning.

a closer  all rom  the tandpoint   my less  essimistic  recast,  t  taking  nto  ccount y sense c f s of p fo bu i a m of  asymmetric  downside  risks, elieve  n  easing s learly stified  day.  An easing  an  be I  b a i c ju to c viewed  as  either    step oward illing    expected ole  in  growth  in  1999 and/or  roviding a t f an h p insurance  gainst    bad  draw from  the  unpleasantly t ail  f  the robability  stribution a a fa t o p di of outcomes.

MR.  BROADDUS. I  would like  o  review  briefly ere  I  am  coming  from, r. t wh M Chairman.  Despite he  rising  urbulence  n  the  international nomy over he  last  ear r  so, t t i eco t y o I

have  been  primarily cused n  the  upside isks  ntil  ecently.  am still  cused n  them at  least fo o r u r I fo o to  some extent. ntil ecently, ave felt  hat  he  effects  f he  foreign hocks  were  primarily U r I  h t t o t s two-sided n  terms  of  their plications r DP  growth.  The drag  on GDP  growth  from i im fo G reduced  net xports  as offset  o  a  considerable gree  in  my  view  by  lower  interest  tes  ue  to e w t de ra d the  flight   quality  nd  by  downward  pressure  n  domestic rices ccasioned  y the tronger to a o p o b s dollar  nd  lower  commodity prices.  ith that  ffset  n  place,    tended o ook  through he a W o i I t l t international  oblems  to  the omestic  economy where  I  saw very  rapid rowth  in  M2  and a  high pr d g level f  economic activity.  at  for e translated  to  n inflation  sk. hat  situation  early o Th m in a ri T cl has  changed  dramatically.  e huge  increase  n  perceived  isk  n  financial rkets,  f  t ersists, Th i r i ma i i p may well  short-circuit   arlier,  inly  favorable, pact f  foreign  evelopments n U.S. thee ma im o d o financial  onditions.   this  ew environment,  e no  longer  ave  that ffset. ob McTeer will c In n w h o B be  happy  to  know that    am no  longer  n  favor f ightening netary  policy.

While  the  downside  risk  n  the omestic  outlook  learly   greater  han t  as,  that i d c is t i w alone  would not e  enough  to  persuade e that  e need  to ase  monetary  policy,   least  ot b m w e at n quite et.  I  see  continuation   very  strong  onditions   the conomy  and  not  much  evidence y a of c in e that hey  are  going  to  weaken significantly he  near  future.  f  here s  case  for asing ow, t in  t I t i a e n from  my  standpoint  ould be  to  signal hat  e  are ot ndifferent    the rowing  risks  n  world itw t w n i to g i financial rkets  and  that  e are  prepared  o e  flexible ing  forward s  emerging ma w t b go a developments  may require.  n  my view,  25 basis oints  s   sufficient  gnal  o  get  that essage I p i a si t m across.  I  think    50 basis  oint eduction  ould  go  well  beyond what  is ecessary. a p r w n

As far s  the  symmetry of  the irective   oncerned,  ince   think a d isc s I a 1/4 point eduction r is oing  to ut  us  a  little  ead  of he urve--I  ay be  the nly erson  in  the oom who feels  hat g p ah t c m o p r t way but  I  do  feel hat  ay--I ould  prefer    symmetric  directive. t w w a

MR. JORDAN. Thank you. My  position   not  a  1ot  different  om  that  ust  xpressed is fr j e by  Al  Broaddus.  I  had  been  hoping  for uite  ome time  for he  emergence  of nvestor ution. q s t i ca Rational  ptimism  is esirable,  t  investor ntiment  as well  beyond anything hat    would o d bu se w t I have  called  ational timism.  Having  both  lenders  nd  other nvestors   a  little  re reasoned r op a i be mo in  weighing  risks  s ertainly  sirable,  t  we got  there oo ast.  t ent  too ar,  nd  we now are i c de bu t f I w f a dealing  ith  a  crisis   confidence.  e  do not  want  to  see  a seizing  p  in  financial  rkets, w of W u ma domestic  or oreign. oreign inancial rkets  have  seized  p to  a  large xtent.  o,  I  am hoping f F f ma u e S that his  ncertainty ll issipate pidly  nd  that  e can  turn ack  to  a situation  at  s  more t u wi d ra a w b th i reflective   he  fundamentals. think hat ny  action hat  e take ill e  more symbolic--a oft I t a t w w b message  that  ay have  a  political  mponent--than  eeded  in  a  fundamental ense.   hope  that m co n s I turns  ut  to e  the  case. or  that  eason,    think  t  s esirable   do the  minimum  that  e can  get o b F r I i i d to w away with.  To do  otherwise  ould  be  to  ignore  o  our  peril  he apid cceleration  at  e have w t t r a th w seen  in  all f he oney,  reserve,  nd  credit  ggregates.  e  have  to e  careful  bout hat. o t m a a W b a t

As far s  the ymmetry is  concerned,    always  prefer  ymmetric  directives. t  I  do a s I s Bu not  feel  trongly  nough about  asymmetry  or  symmetry  that    would  dissent  rom  an  asymmetric s e I f directive.

MR.  POOLE. I  support  he  proposed  cut f 5 basis  oints.    have  a  preference  or t o 2 p I f symmetry,  but  I  don't  elieve  he ssue  s ery  important.  n  the  long  run  what  we do  is hat b t i i v I w determines  he  outcome,  although   believe  hat hat  we say  can  be  extremely mportant  n  the t I t w i i short  un.  So,  we need  to  be  clear  bout  our  direction d  our  purpose. e  have  to mphasize r a an W e that ur  intention  o  focus n the .S.  economy not  because  we are  unconcerned ith  what  is o ist o U w going  on abroad  but ecause  we have  only  one  policy  nstrument.  t  best,  e can  serve ne b i A w o policy  bjective  nd  that hould e  to  achieve rice tability  maintain ow  inflation    the o a s b p s or l in United  States.  hat  is  very mportant  essage  that  e need  to epeat  ontinuously. rket T a i m w r c Ma expectations e  very  important  n  terms  of ow monetary  policy  xerts  ts  ffects   the  short ar i h e i e in run.

MR.  MOSKOW. Mr. Chairman,  I  support our  recommendation  for   25 basis oint y a p reduction  n  the  fed  funds  rate.  n  my  opinion,  oing eyond  that  learly  ould  be  seen  as  an i I g b c w overreaction d some would view  it s  panic n our  part. t s  important  or s  to  keep  in  mind an a o I i f u that e are  basing his  olicy  ction  n projections,    you said,  nd  we have  to e  somewhat w t p a o as a b humble about  our  record n projections. o

MS. MINEHAN.

Sounds  good.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice  Chair,  o  you wish  to  comment? d

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Yes,  Mr.  Chairman. I  want  to  give  the Committee  members some background  about  the nvolvement f  the  Federal eserve  Bank of i o R New  York in  helping    number of rivate  ector  inancial stitutions  ive  t   decision  o  inject a p s f in arr a a t capital  nto ong-Term Capital  ortfolio TCP). Long-Term Capital  anagement  (LTCM), a i L P (L M hedge  fund  management company established    1994,  created    set f unds  that ollectively  e in a o f c ar called  ong-Term Capital  ortfolio. e founder as John  Meriwether.  His  senior  olleagues L P Th w c are  David  Mullins,  ormerly f his  oard,  and  two  Nobel  Prize inning  economists/ f o t B w mathematicians, b Merton and  Myron  Scholes,  lus  some others,  ost  of  whom  were Bo p m recruited om Salomon Brothers  here  Meriwether  had  worked before. fr w

They were  quite  uccessful   1994 and  very  successful   1995 and 1996. In  each  of s in in those  two  years hey  returned  o  their  nvestors er 0 percent  f heir  nitial  vestments  fter t t i ov 4 o t i in a the  deduction  f  very  considerable es y  the  management company.  All  their  nvestors re o fe b i we either  irms r  high  net orth  individuals  o invested    minimum  of  $10 million.  uring  this f o w wh a D

period,  he  fund's  erformance xhibited    very  low  level f olatility. y were  consistently t p e a o v The successful, d, ot  surprisingly,  y  apparently  egan  to  believe  ery  firmly  n  their  bility an n the b v i a to continue  o  be  successful.  hey did  not  take ssentially  e-sided  ets n  transactions.  ther, t T e on b o Ra they  were  speculating  spreads f  the  kind  that  eter isher  escribed  arlier,   over  time on o P F d e and they  also ent  into preads n equities   well  as  fixed-income  nstruments.  n  1997,  they ere w s o as i I w somewhat less uccessful.  f   remember correctly,  ey ad a  return  f  about  17 percent.  t  the s I I th h o A end of  the ear,  hey  decided hat arket  opportunities  re  not  as  great  s  in  previous  ears nd y t t m we a y a that hey  could  not  profitably  e  as  much  capital  s  they ad  previously,   they eturned  bout t us a h so r a $2.8  billion  o  their  nvestors. e year  1998 has  been  considerably ss  uccessful;    the nd t i Th le s by e of  August, hey  had  lost  2  percent  f he  capital at hey ad  at he  start  f he  year.  During t 5 o t th t h t o t August,  LTCM officials  proached ome very  prestigious  nancial rms n  New  York to  see  if ap s fi fi i additional vestors uld  be brought n.  On Wednesday,  September  2,  Meriwether ent  letter in co i s a to  the  investors   LTCP.  Knowledge of  that  etter came quite idely  spread. eriwether of l be w M reported  he  losses, t e also xpressed    great  eal  of  confidence.  He said  n  his etter  at  e t bu h e a d i l th h thought here ere  investment  pportunities  d  he  encouraged  his xisting vestors  nvest t w o an e in toi more. At  the  same time,  s  I  mentioned,  e  was seeking ew investors,  th  directly  d a h n bo an through  some securities  rms. fi

Meriwether  and  Mullins nformed e on September  15 that  hey ad  to  raise i m t h a significant  ount of  additional pital--about    to  $1-1/2  billion--in er  o  support  he  risk am ca $1 ord t t positions   LTCP  and  have  the taying  ower  that  hey eeded.  Two  days  later, ey nformed of s p t n th i our  Bank that  hey  had  been  unsuccessful  n  that  egard. hat  is,  hey  were  not  able o  raise  he t i r T t t t money directly   through he  securities  rms hey  were  using. or t fi t

You may remember that  he  markets  were  very  turbulent  September  18. In  such t on situations  ake an  effort,    did  all y predecessors   this  ob,  o  talk  o  the  heads  of he  major I  m as m in j t t t

banks  and  securities  rms n  New  York. My  purpose s o  get  a  feel or wo  things--what ey fi i i t f t h think  s  going  on  in  the arkets nd  how their n  firm s oing.  Early n  the  day  had  heard i m a ow i d i I from  Messrs. eriwether  and  Mullins  who told e  that  heir  osses  ere continuing.  thanked M m t l w I them for he  information.  t as fascinating    me that very ead  of he  8 to  10  firms hat t I w to e h t t I talked  o  subsequently  uring he  day  brought p  the  problems  of t d t u LTCM/P independently  f o anything  hat    said. hey gave  particular  phasis  to  what  in  their ew would  be the ery t I T em vi v serious  roblems  that   failure   that  irm  would create  n  financial rkets. hey were  not p a of f i ma T talking  articularly  out  the  problems  that uch  a failure uld cause or heir  wn firms ut p ab s wo f t o b rather  bout  the roblems  that  t ould cause  for he inancial rkets n  general. a p i w t f ma i

The reason hose roblems  could  arise  s hat  TCM,  because  of ts revious  uccess, t p i t L i p s was able  to  take ositions th  its  ounterparties  the arket  that ssentially olved reditors p wi c in m e inv c lending o  them with  no  initial  rgin.  That  is, f  TCP  were  financing    position  f  100,  their t ma i L a o creditors uld lend hem 100. So,  LTCP  did  not  have  any  limitation   the  size f  its  ositions wo t on o p based  on  the  need  for n initial  rgin.  The result s that  he  firm's sitions   a  variety  f a ma wa t po in o instruments  round  the  world  were  very  large. hat my contacts  ere  talking  bout  was the a W w a effect  hat  he  failure  he irm  would have  on world  markets  if  ll hese ositions d  to e t t oft f a t p ha b dumped on  the  markets.  People  who thought hey  had  an  offsetting  sition th  LTCP  would t po wi suddenly ind hat  hey  did  not  have  one.  They would  find hemselves  ith  big  open  positions f t t t w that  hey  had to  worry  about. t

Late  in  the ay  on September  18,  a  major  securities  rm hat  ad  been  very  involved d fi t h in  trying  o ind quity  nvestors r TCP  informed e that hey ad  asked  LTCM t f e i fo L m t h if  hey,  he t t securities  rm, ould hare  with  the ederal eserve  their  nowledge  of  the ositions d fi c s F R k p an condition  f  Long-Term Capital  ortfolio.  ng-Term Capital  anagement  said hat  hey  would o P Lo M t t rather  xplain heir  ituation    us  directly.  agreed  on  Saturday,  eptember  19,  that  eter  isher e t s to I S P F

would lead  a  group  of eople o  visit e irm  in  Greenwich on Sunday.  To make a  long  story p t th f somewhat shorter,   and  his  group, hich included  ino  Kos and  some others,  ere  joined  y he w D w b Mr.  Gensler f  the  U.S.  Treasury. t that  oint  as in  an  awkward  position  ecause,  earing o A p Iw b w my supervisor  at,    had  to o  to  London to  give  speech  and  hold  press onference.  he h I g a a c T nature f  my position   such  that f    did ot  make my  scheduled  peech  at  a  time  when rumors o is i I n s were  circulating    New  York about  a  number of  securities  rms--not  st  TCP--market in fi ju L participants  ght  conclude hat   firm  was about  to  fail.  hat  was not  a signal  hat    wanted  to mi t a T t I give.

Fortunately,   distinguished  lleague,  r.  Fisher,  ould emain  in  New  York and my co M c r set p  a  team.  He did  lot  f  the ealing  ith  LTCM. u a o d w He and  I  engaged  in  lengthy  iscussions, d and  we shared he iew  that he ollapse  f  Long-Term Capital  ortfolio uld create  haotic t v t c o P wo c financial  arkets  around  the  world  and  that  obody could ake a  good estimate  f  what  the m n m o likely  amage would  be.  By this  ime  we knew that  iew  was shared y  Goldman  Sachs, errill d t v b M Lynch,  JP  Morgan, and  shortly  fter, S.  To go back  to  some conversations at  e had  earlier a UB th w today, t as our  view  that  he ffect  f  the  firm's ilure uld  be  to  depress quity  arkets nd i w t e o fa wo e m a to  create  idening  spreads n  fixed-income  arkets.  What the  downside  effect  f  that ould  be w i m o w on many economies, ncluding  hat  f  the  United  States,  ould ot e  easily  scertained.  lso i t o c n b a Ita became clear  hat  ven  though  LTCM t e had  been  working  with  at  least  he our irms hat t f f t I mentioned, hey  had  not  been  able o  establish ough of  an  identity  nterests    make it t t en ofi to possible  or he  private  nvestors   get  the nterested  rties gether.  hese  were  deemed by f t i to i pa to T this  ime  to  be  approximately  7 financial stitutions  und  the orld  that  ad  very  large t 1 in aro w h counterparty  ositions th  LTCP. p wi

Peter eld  a  series  f  meetings,  ut he  climactic eting ccurred ast  ednesday at h o b t me o l W which 15 firms ere  represented.  began  the  meeting y  explaining  hat  f  t as possible  or w I b t i i w f the  private  ector  irms o each  a  decision  n  their  nterest--one t as freely  rrived  t y s f t r i i tha w a a b them because here ould be  no  public oney involved--that  uld  be in  the  best nterests t w m wo i of markets  in  general  nd  of he eople  who depend  on markets.  At  the nd  of he  day, he  private a t p e t t sector  irms eached  a  conclusion  fter    very  long  struggle.  e  stayed ut  of  the ray,  ut t f r a a W o f b i was perfectly ear  n  light  f  the act  hat  e were  present--I  s in  the  room;  Peter  as in  the cl i o f t w wa w room;  the  chairman  of  the ew  York Stock xchange was in  the  room--that  e had  an  interest N E w in their  oming  to  a  conclusion.  he conclusion  eached,  ncluding  ll he  terms nd  the  conditions, c T r i a t a was theirs, t  ours. t  was not  suggested  y  us; t as  not  guided y  us. no I b i w b

In  a  subsequent  eries  f eetings,  he etails re  finally rked out  with  some s o m t d we wo difficulty.  te  in  the  afternoon  n  Friday,    was asked  by  the  person residing er he  private La o I p ov t sector  roup  if  he ederal eserve  Bank of  New  York would  "authorize  meeting f he g t F R a o t seniors," at  s,  he  people ho had  been  in  our  board  room on  Wednesday,  or  invite  hem  to  the th i t w t meeting, r  attend  he eeting, r  ask  Peter  isher  o ttend  he  meeting.   said None of  the o t m o F t a t I " above.  We  got  you  folks o  a  point here  you  could  all e  in  the oom and where  you  could ind t w b r f it ossible  o  arrive  t  a  decision.  ut  if  here  till  e ifficulties  our losing  he  deal,  ou p t a B t s ar d in  y c t y

have  to  resolve  hem."  The problem  with  our  convening he  meeting  and  sitting  ere lowering t t th g at  people o  induce hem  to  reach n  agreement  is hat f  hey ere not  able  to  solve he roblem, t t a t i t w t p then  it  ould  be  our  deal.  The Federal eserve  would be  excessively,  appropriately, w R in and unwisely nvolved. i

So,  the  involvement f he  Federal eserve  Bank of ew  York was essentially o t R N to bring  the arties  ogether cause  we agreed  with  the  heads  of  four f he  major  securities  rms p t be o t fi in  the orld  that    failure  TCP  would  bring haotic  arket  conditions, th  immeasurable w a ofL c m wi and  essentially  estimable mage to  economies  around  the  world.  That  was a sufficiently at in da gre danger  that  e believed  e should se  the remises nd  the  good offices  f  the ederal eserve w w u p a o F R Bank of  New  York to  bring eople  together  o  they  would  have  an opportunity  o each  a p s t r conclusion.

Peter isher  an  answer  any  number of uestions  ou might  have  on  the  details,  t F c q y bu my  summary is  essentially  e  story egarding  he ederal eserve's  nvolvement. e  put  the th r t F R i W name of  the  Federal eserve  Bank of  New  York on  the  line, d  of  course t  s art f  the R an i i p o Federal eserve  System.  I  put  on the  line y personal restige  f eing  in  that  usiness  ost  of R m p o b b m my life  nd  therefore ing  considered  y  the  other  articipants  the oom as  having  a a be b p in r knowledge of  these hings.    believe  e did  the  right  hing,  ut  I  certainly  derstand  hy others t I w t b un w could  say  we went a  little  o  close  o  the  edge  or e went  over he  edge.  Thank you, r. to t w t M Chairman.

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. They were looking t  both  in  my  view.  There a was a  good deal f  concern  about  the acroeconomic effects.  here  also as a  belief o m T w or

assumption  that f  he TCP  collapsed, reads ould  widen put, t ould  be very  difficult i t L sp w i w to mark positions   market, nd there ould  be some chaos  for   week or  two where  it ould be to a c a w very  difficult  r arkets  to  function.  uring  that  eriod,  ertainly,  e ark-to-market  osses fo m D p c th m l for he  firms ould be  moving in  all irections.  erefore, ere s o  question  n  my view  that t w d Th th i n i they  thought hey  would be  better  ff f  here ere  a  solution.  hey get  paid or aking that t o i t w T f m kind  of udgment  in  the nterest  heir  hareholders. ere  also as quite    lot f  discussion, j i oft s Th w a o which sounded  rather  incere, at  hey  as  the  "seniors"  f he  financial rvices  usiness  n  New s th t o t se b i York had  a  responsibility he  financial stem.

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Richard  Spillenkothen ght  be  able  to  pick mi this p  better.   staff  roup  from  the oard  of  Governors  and  the ew  York Reserve  Bank u A g B N made a  number of isits st  ecember to  the  major  banks, oth  national  anks  and state  ember v la D b b m banks, nd  put  out  a  memorandum a on the  subject  n  April. i

MR.  SPILLENKOTHEN. I  should robably oint ut  that  his as not  an on-site p p o t w examination. ur staffs  et  with  the  managements of  these nstitutions. ink hey ame away O m i I  th t c with  a  feeling  hat, nerally  peaking,  he  banks  were saying he ight  hings  n  terms f  the t ge s t t r t i o kinds  of isk  anagement processes  hey  had  in  place. he bankers alked    lot bout  how their r m t T t a a involvement ith  hedge  funds  was becoming  a  bigger  art f heir  verall  usiness  ctivities, w p o t o b a and  they oted  that  hey  actually d  staff o managed their  elationships h  the ig  hedge n t ha wh r wit b funds  because f  the ature f  the  business.    gathered hat  he ankers ere  indicating at  hey o n o I t t b w th t

had  the  policies d  procedures  n  place o  deal  in  a  fairly fective y with he  risks  hat an i t ef wa t t generally  ere  involved. w

In  terms  of his  ituation,  hink hat  he  issues  ither  hen  or oing  forward re t s I  t t t e t g a threefold. e is  the xtent  o  which the  banks  actually e  applying hese isk  anagement On e t ar t r m policies   the ourse f  their  ctivities. t  application   policies s  to  be  looked  at n  the in c o a Tha of ha i context  f  the  examination rocess. e  indicated  n  the  memorandum,  as  Bill  cDonough o p W i M mentioned, hat his  as an area  that e needed  to  continue  o  focus  on  in  the ourse f  the t t w w t c o examination rocess. econdly, n  terms  of  the  issues  ere,   think  he obustness  ith  which the p S i h I t r w banks  applied  heir  wn  policies s adversely  ffected  their  erception  f he  reputation t o wa a by p o t of the  people ho ran  LTCM/P. w The  final  oint  s hat  n  terms f essons  earned,  lot  f  the ocus p i t i o l l a o f here  has  to e  on  collateral  d  collateral  nagement. One thing hat  his  xperience  as b an ma t t e h underscored--and  ctually  e have  known this  or ome time--is at  ollateral    only  one  aspect a w f s th c is of  the  overall  ontrol  f redit  isk, t  it s ot  a replacement  or he anks' nalysis   the c o c r bu i n f t b a of overall  reditworthiness   he  borrower. c oft

At  this  oint,  e think  he  banks  had  the ight  olicies d  procedures  n  place. he p w t r p an i T question  s  how effectively  e  banks  were  implementing hose olicies d  procedures.  e i th t p an W have  people  visiting  e  three ajor  state  ember banks  today,  nd tomorrow  they ill e  at th m m a w b Salomon,  to  talk  bout he  overall  xposure f  these nstitutions  edge  funds, heir posure o a t e o i to  h t ex t LTCM,  the  extent  o  which  they  actually e ollowing  he olicies at  hey aid hey ad  in t ar f t p th t s t h place,  nd  whether hey  treated CM a t LT differently  om  other edge  funds  for hatever easons. fr h w r I  think he asic nswer  is hat  e were reasonably  omfortable  hat  hey ad  the  policies t b a t w c t t h in place,  ut  the uestion  s ow effectively  e  banks  were actually plementing hem  in  the  case b q i h th im t of  this  articular  stitution. still ve  to  look  into  hat. p in We ha t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. When  we conduct  our  examinations, now that  e I  k w check  to ee  whether ank  policies e  being mplemented, ut  how did  we do  that  ith  respect s b ar i b w to,  ay, organ  and  LTCM? s M Did  we actually  valuate  he  loan ortfolio at  epresented e t p th r Morgan's  claims  against  TCM/P L to  see  whether,  n  fact, rgan abided y  the rinciples  at i Mo b p th you  just  utlined? o

MR.  SPILLENKOTHEN. We  typically   some transactions  sting   see  if  anks do te to b are  carrying  ut heir  olicies th  respect  o  counterparties.  tually, e ankers  Trust nd o t p wi t Ac th B a Morgan exams are  now under  way. Just efore   came to  this  eeting,    looked  at he  previous b I m I t examination,  nd  there as no  mention  of  LTCM a w in  it.  ut  that  irm rew rapidly, d  the anks B f g an b may have  had  a  fairly dest  amount  of  exposure t  the ime  of he  previous  xamination.  t mo a t t e A this  oint,    cannot ay  whether  we looked  at  the articular  lationship  u  mentioned,  ut  we p I s p re yo b do  look  at nd  test  o ee  whether  a  bank's  olicies e  being mplemented.  We  do  not  do  that a t s p ar i for very  counterparty   any means. We  do  a  spot heck. e by c

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Rich,  it ould ell  be  that, th  the apid c w wi r growth  of  LTCP  and  the  increasing volvement f anks  in  dealing  ith  hedge  funds, he  banks in o b w t may not  even  have  been  dealing ith TCP  at  the  time  of  the revious xam. w L p e

MR.  SPILLENKOTHEN. Yes,  that  revious  xam probably ould have  been  as  of p e w the  middle  of  1997. That  exam would have  been  over  year ld.  That's  question  e have  to a o a w go back  and  take  look  at. a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Where we are  most  vulnerable  s  with  regard o  the i t adequacy  of ur  examinations. o

We  rarely  ome up against    situation  ere we say  this  s wful, he  institution  alling c a wh i a t is  f

apart,  nd we did  not  spot he eterioration.  r  example, hen we looked  into he  Japanese a t d Fo w t operation  n  New  York  in  which  the mbezzlement  occurred-i e

SEVERAL. Daiwa.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Daiwa,  yes.  What Daiwa exposed  is ow complex h these ituations  e  and  how few troops e have  to ook  into hem. s ar w l t if  e had  to eet  the  standards  hat  eople hink xist,  would have  five w m t p t e we times  as  many examiners We  would examine  them to  death, nd  they ould not ave  any  breathing  oom. a w h r

What we need  at  this  tage s ome sense f  whether e are xamining  very s i s o w e specifically  at  actually ppened  in  the  LTCM wh ha situation. en  I  was in  the rivate  ector, Wh p s I remember looking t  the etails  f  particular  ans hat  ere  shown to  bank  directors. as on a d o lo t w I  w the  loan  committee f ne  of hese ajor  banking  institutions,  we actually nt  through he o o t m and we t loan  portfolio jor  client   major  client. e bank's enior  oan  officers uld provide ma by Th s l wo a basic eview.  They would  take he  loan  portfolio d  point  o  the  vulnerabilities    strengths r t an t and of the orrowers nd  give  their  valuations   the isks  hat  ere  involved.  he review  was quite b a e of r t w T thorough.   knew that    was getting  bit f  snow  job--the pe  of hing here  mistakes ever I I a o a ty t w n are  made and  everything  s erfect.  ut  even  adjusting r hat,  he  examination  as at  a  level i p B fo t t w that ould  not  have  allowed his  TCP  problem  to  happen.  But  it  id  happen  and  a number  of w t L d extraordinarily ective unterparties  re  involved. he question  s hy it appened  in  this eff co we T i w h

case.  Is  it  ust  hat  he enders  ere  dazzled y  the  people t TCM j t t l w b a L and  did ot  take  close n a look?

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. I  think  here  as in  place  credit  anagement t w a m system  that ppeared o  make a great eal  of  sense. a t d

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Whose?  LTCM's?

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. No,  the  lenders, cluding  he  institution h in t wit which you  were  once  associated. e may question  he otion hat t  least  or ome lenders On t n t a f s there as no initial  rgin  requirement.  eyond that  ssue,  t hould  be  emphasized  that  he w ma B i i s t lenders  ad  very  good  collateral  nagement systems o  that f  he TCP  began  to  lose n a h ma s i t L o position,   ould  need  to ut  added  collateral    place. hat we have  to et  our  hands  around itw p in W g conceptually   whether here as something  that  e missed  that ould ave  provided s  with is t w w c h u some notion f ust  ow big  the  overall  osition  f TCP  had  become. I  don't  now how we o j h p o L k could  have  done  that.  e  do not egulate at irm. ut  given  the umber of nstitutions  y W r th f B n i the dealt  ith  around  the orld, as there   way that hould ave  enabled s  to  be  more aware  of w w w a s h u their  verall  osition?  ne is nclined  o  say, you bet."

MR. TRUMAN. There  is ollateral  t  no margin. c bu

MR. FISHER.  If   lend  $100 to  LTCP  they ive  me an  asset  orth  $100. If he I g w t market  value f  that  sset  oes  up 5  percent  oday,    give  them  back  $5  dollars;   t oes  down  5 o a g t I ifi g percent omorrow  they  give  me $5  dollars. t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That  is  100  percent ollateralized  k-to-market a c mar position.

MR. FISHER.  Right.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Now, in  order or e as  a  bank  to  lose n  this ituation, f m i s I  either  ave  to ind hat  he ollateral  ave  is ot egally ailable der ertain  ircumstances h f t t c I  h n l av un c c or  its  arket  value as  declined.  hich was it  n  this  ase? m h W i c

MR. FISHER.  It as the  latter.  e collateral  st  arket  value. w Th lo m

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. So,  the ollateral  st  alue nd  LTCP  did  not  have  the c lo v a resources  o  make up  for he  loss. t t

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. That's  ight. r

MR.  FISHER.  I  want  to  be  clear, .  Chairman. We  are alking  bout   balance heet Mr t a a s of  $125 billion d  an  off-balance-sheet 1.4 trillion.  w, we know the  total  as not  all an of  $ No w

collateralized 00 cents n the  dollar.  t as only  the  balance heet inancing  hat  as fully at  1 o I w s f t w collateralized.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let's  eave he  derivatives  t. l t ou

MR.  FISHER.  I  realize  s  notional, t  we do  not  know how to  scale  he  notionals. iti bu t MR.  TRUMAN. The off-balance-sheet sumably  goes  the  same way as  the  balance pre sheet.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. There  are  two  ways of oming at  this.  here  are  certain c T transactions  tween  counterparties  derivatives  ere net  positions e  fully  ollateralized be in wh ar c or up  to  percent  nd  in  some cases here  s o  collateral    all. traight nding sually  s ully X a t i n at S le u i f collateralized. n't  now what  bankers  are  going  to  write ff n  these osses, t  what  I'm I  do k o o l bu trying  o  get t s here  the  losses  o  the anks  are  coming  from.  Are  we looking  t t a i w t b a uncollateralized ivative sitions at ent  against  TCP  and  in  favor f  a  bank, hich der po th w L o w theoretically    a net osition  f 20 million  ut  discovers  hat  t eally  as  a  $20 million  redit has p o $ b t i r h c problem? In  other ords,  where  are  the  losses  oming  from  as  best e can  see? w c w

MR.  SPILLENKOTHEN. Initially,  se ransactions    derivatives  re  in  a sense the t in we unsecured. nce the  exposure eached  a  certain  oint,  hen  the ender, e ank, ad  the  right  o O r p t l th b h t demand collateral    cover hat.  hat  is,  hen the ark-to-market  osition  nd  the urrent to t T w m p a c exposure  built  p  to  certain  oint, en  the  banks  asked  for he ollateral.  cording  to  the u a p th t c Ac numbers we have  now, it  ppears hat  he  mark-to-market  ositions  hese ig  institutions a t t p oft b are largely  overed y collateral.  ,  it oes  not  seem that  here s uch loss  n  their rrent c b So d t i m i cu mark-to-market  ositions  nd  other  erivatives sitions. e of  the  problems  is he  potential p a d po On t future  xposure.   am going  to  say  this  n  English. f arkets eep  moving away from  them  in e I i I m k the  wrong direction,  eir  uture  xposure ould  be  very  large nd  they ight  not  have  the th f e c a m collateral   hat oint  n  time  to  cover hat  xposure. att p i t e

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That  is   different  sue. s far s  bookkeeping s a is A a i concerned,  anks  do  not ook  those nticipatory  sses  nless ome real ommitments are b b a lo u s c involved. hat I  am trying  o  focus n is here  the osses  re  coming from. W t o w l a

MR.  FISHER.  Let  me try o  work through  some of he  sources f  the osses  hat  ere t t o l t w discussed.  ong-Term Capital  anagement did  an  analysis  f ts  op  17 counterparties  just L M o i t on 12  trades. hese  represented  very  small  percent  f he  hundreds f rades  hat  hey ad  on  their T a o t o t t t h books, ut  they ere their  ig  trades.  or  example,  of  these 2 had  losses  f  $1/2  billion er b w b F 2 1 o ov a  period f  30  days; here ere some offsets  nvolving  ery  complicated  ransactions. o t w i v t The scenario  hat  TCM t L worked out  attempted o  take nto ccount egative  ovements in  each  of t i a n m the  asset  arkets. hat  is,  f  he  market oved against  he osition  n  the irection ere m T i t m t p i d wh liquidation  s likely  o  occur, here  ould be  an acceleration    the osses.  ut  neither  he wa t t w of l B t people  at  LTCM nor  I  nor  thers  ho looked  at his  hought   meltdown scenario  as involved. o w t t a w The losses  ctually re  the  result  f iscrete d  days  in  each  of hese arkets. hey  had a we o d ba t m T generated    counterparty ss f  $2.8  billion at  as spread  among the op  17 lenders.  hat  was a lo o th w t T at  a  time  hen the et  asset  alue  of he ollateral  s about 1 billion  r 1 billion us,  o w n v t c wa $ o $ pl s there ere  $1-1/2  billion   so  of  losses  o  be  shared mong the op  counterparties.  hink w or t a t I  t a number of  us  who eyeballed  hat nalysis  hought hat  t as one  thing  o  focus n  just  he rades t a t t i w t o t t in  question; t  if  ll he rades  f hose irms ere  included,  his  irect  oss ould ise  o  $3 to bu a t t o t f w t d l c r t $5 billion. at  was a number that  he  other irms hat  ere actively  ooking  t  the  numbers  also Th t f t w l a thought  was a  plausible recast  f  a liquidation  enario  nvolving st  he op  17 lenders. fo o sc i ju t t

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. I  suggest  hat  hat  would  be  valuable  or he t w f t Committee,  for ll f  us, ould  be  to  make certain  ssumptions bout arket  developments nd a o w a a m a then  see  what  the ookkeeping ffects  ould  be.  How  does  firm  suffer    loss ecause  of ts b e w X a b i relationship  th  LTCP? wi This  gets s  into ery  sophisticated  counting  nd  complex  analyses u v ac a

of  losses.    think  e are  all rying  o  make estimates  the  fly,  ut  that  s ot  going  to  give I w t t on b i n a very  accurate  escription  ow it  eally  orks. d ofh r w

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. What I  think e are  going  to  need  for ur  testimony  n w o o Thursday  is  a  general ummary of hat  we do  as  examiners,  ow often e do  it,  nd  why banks s w h w a with  a huge  amount  of xperience  n  lending  ot  caught n  this  ind  of hing.  e  need  an e i g i k t W answer.  The answer  is ot  that  t hould ot ave  happened.  Part f anking  involves  osing n i s n h o b l money. Banks never  make a  loan  that hey  do  not xpect o  be  repaid. n  that ense,  very  loss t e t I s e is n error.  he issue s  to  define  he  error. a T i t

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. I  agree hat  e are oing  to  need  that t w g information  or ur  testimony, ich  is  being  prepared y some of he eople ho are  sitting f o wh b t p w at the  end  of his  able. t t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. If e indicate  hat  we are  doing  to  find he nswers, w w t a that  s  fine. his o  me is here  the ssue  f  the  responsiveness   the ederal eserve  is oing i T t w i o of F R g to  be.

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. I  assume  that  ne of he hings  e will ant  to o t t w w talk  bout  is he act hat  e had  staff,  her han  those ho were  conducting  xaminations, o a t f t w ot t w e wh were  meeting  with  the anagement people o  examine  the  nature  f  their aling ith  hedge m t o de w funds.  In  their  eport, e  staff ntioned TCM/P r th me L as  one  of he ustomers f  some of he t c o t institutions.  t did  we learn here?  What might  we have  learned  n  addition?  t s ot  as  if Wha t i I i n we were asleep.   think hat  s  we write he estimony,  hich  already s n  process,  e will ave I t a t t w i i w h

a  story.  he only  fully  onvincing tory  s hat  he  problem  did  not  happen, nd  we know that  s T c s i t t a i not  the  case.  [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. All  I  care  about s hat  e produce  accurate  estimony. i t w t MS. RIVLIN.  I  agree.

MR. FISHER.  I would  like o  offer  ne  final  erspective   the  numbers that t o p on I discussed.  ne of he  surprises r eople  who went  to  look  at  LTCP's position,  self O t fo p my included,  as the  tremendous  size f  their  quity  nd equity  olatility itions. ople  knew w o e a v pos Pe they  were  dabbling  n  that ector  f  the arkets,  ut  everyone ncluding  lot f  the  press ad i s o m b i a o h thought f  LTCP  as  a fixed-income  hop.  Some  of he  firms ho  looked t TCP's position o s t w a L in more detail  han  I, ho had  the  weekend to  investigate, t  hat he  preponderance  f he t w felt t o t exposure,  f  ne  uses he  $3  to  $5 billion mber,  that  eeded  to  be  stabilized  s the quity i o t nu n wa e position  nd  the  equity  olatility ition.  hat's  n  trades  ith  LTCP  in  total-rate-of-return a v pos T i w swaps.  A  lesser  art f  the osses  as in  the ixed-income  inancing  rea.  So,  the igger  isk p o l w f f a b r was this  uge  equity  olatility ition  hat  TCP  had  taken  on. h v pos t L

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. One of  the hings  hat e have  to  be  able o t t w t say  to  Congress  is hether he  state-chartered ks  that e supervise  articipated    the  equity w t ban w p in piece r  not.  I  do  not now the nswer  at his  oint. o k a t p

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Have we developed  a series  f uestions  or he o q f t testimony hat e are  asking urselves?    think hat ould  be very  useful.  n  other  ords,  in  the t w o I t w I w testimony  e should dentify e  questions  o  which  we do  not  yet now the nswer. w i th t k a

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. We  will ay  what  we know, and  then  we will s say  what  we do  not  know  and  are  trying  o ind ut. t f o

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It as  to  be  a full  eport  n what  we know and  do not h r o know.

MR.  FERGUSON. Two  questions  ome to  my mind. One relates   reports  hat  ome c to t s of  the  institutions  e  not ust  enders  ut  also nvestors. ose,   presume, ainly  have  been wer j l b i Th I m investment  anks.  Do we think  here lso re ome section  0s  or  others hat  ay have  been b t a a s 2 t m involved?

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. There  was a  foreign  ank,  UBS, that  as a b w large nvestor  nd  its  nvestment  ccounted or   good  chunk  of he  loss hat  he  bank  announced i a i a f a t t t last  hursday. T

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Did  they  participate  rough  an  American affiliate th or directly om  Switzerland? fr

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. We  think t as Switzerland, t  that  s gain  a i w bu i a fact hat  e have  to  establish.   lso as  now been  reported  n  the  press hat ome senior  fficers t w Ita h i t s o of  the ecurities  rms,  e think  ot  of  the anks, ere involved  s  individuals  ther  hrough s fi w n b w a ei t a retained  arnings  und  for enior  xecutives  t  their  nstitutions irectly   investors e f s e a i or  d as in Long-Term Capital  anagement.

MR.  FERGUSON. My  other uestion  s  one  that    also sk  to  make sure hat e will q i I a t w have an  answer.  It nvolves  n  issue hat  s  similar  he  one  that arry eyer was raising. i a t i tot L M Does this xperience  n  any  sense ring nto uestion  he  approach  we are  taking  ith  respect  o e i b i q t w t risk-based  upervision?  o some extent,  t nvolves  hat  we do and  when we do  it. e  need  to s T i i w W figure  ut  how  that  pproach  might  have  to e  adjusted  ased  on this  xperience. o a b b e

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. This  tells u that  he ove toward  risk-based yo t m supervision  s he  right  ay to  be  going. i t w

MS. RIVLIN.  If ou do it ight!  Laughter] y r [

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. We  should  try o  get nough facts  o  make sure t e t that hey  are  doing  what  they ay  they  are  doing.  That  is hat  is eeded  to  give n  intelligent t s w n a

answer  to  the uestion.  f    sound  a little  xious,  t s ecause he eople  who should e writing q I I an i i b t p b the  testimony  re  here  involved  n  this iscussion,  cluding  e. a i d in m Much  as  I  want  to hare ll f s a o this  ith  you,  we have  to  be  sitting  wn  before  r.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I  would  like  o  ask  one  quick actual  uestion  f ur t f q o o legal ounsel. irgil,  ou raised  n  issue  ith  respect  o  whether  in  fact    particular  oup  of c V y a w t a gr new investors  n  LTCM i were investing    violation   the  5 percent  quity  ap.  What have  you in of e c concluded,  f  nything,  n  that uestion? i a o q

MR. MATTINGLY. I  do  not  know what  has  happened, ut  I  suspect  hat  und  has b t f gotten id f  everything  ver  5 percent. r o o

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. So,  it  s n  compliance ith  the ank Holding  Company i i w B Act?

MR. MATTINGLY. Nobody has  told s,  but   read n  the aper hat  hey ave  been u I i p t t h dumping equities,    I  assume  that  hey re rying  o  get  down below 5 percent. so t a t t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Ah!  That  explains  t! i

MR. MATTINGLY. Mr.  Chairman,  some of  the anks  can  take n  equity  osition  n b a p i LTCM in  satisfaction  a  previously  ontracted bt,  ut  some of he  foreign  anks  may have f c e b t b reached  the  5 percent  imit  f he ank Holding  Company  Act. l o t B

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. How  do  we know?  We  do  not  know.

MR.  GRAMLICH. We  do  not  know!

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. We  have  our  usual ntennae ut.  That  is ow a o h we learned rom a variety  f  sources  hat TCM/P f o t L was getting  nto rouble.  e  can  surmise n i t W o the  basis f hat  has  happened  to  spreads hat, though hey  may get orse, nybody who had o w t al t w a an opportunity  o  get  into rouble  ertainly d  a tremendous pportunity.  f othing  lse,  ne t t c ha o I n e o would think hat  he  rumor  mill ould have  brought o  our  attention at  irm  was having t t w t th f X difficulties. hear  all inds f  rumors  in  the  financial rkets,  ut  we have  not  heard f We k o ma b o a hedge  fund  that ould  appear o  be  remotely f  the ize nd  macroeconomic risk  otential   a w t o s a p of LTCM/P.

MR.  FISHER.  It  was something f  a signature  or his  irm o  insist at  f o f t f t th i a counterparty  anted  to  deal  with  them,  there  ould  be  no  initial  rgin.  Not  many  other  irms w w ma f have  gotten way with  that. a

MR.  GRAMLICH. It oes  to  your edazzlement ffect. g b e

MS. MINEHAN. I  might  mention  something hat e found  out  that  ame as  a  bit f t w c o a surprise, mely  that ome of  the  loans ade by some of  the  large  enders  ere participated . na s m l w out So,  we see  shares  n  banks  in  our  District  oth  collateralized    uncollateralized  es  o i ofb and lin t LTCM/P.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. I  think here  ere  two  major  credit  ines, e  of t w l on which was drawn down.  It as a  $900 million  ine f  which slightly  der  $500  million  as w l o un w drawn down and  participated  t.  I  think,  owever, hat ost  of  the ransactions   have  been ou h t m t we talking  bout  here  involve  ounterparties  ther  han  syndications. a c ra t

MS. MINEHAN. I  realize at  ut  there  ere  at  least  wo  syndicated  ools. th b w t p

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Yes,  one  to he  management company and  one t to  the artnership. p

MS. MINEHAN. I  was wondering  whether  any  of his  howed up  in  the eview  of t s r shared ational  redits  ast  ear. n c l y

MR.  SPILLENKOTHEN. As I  recall,  e  credit  as $700 million.  t as $500 th w I w million  nitially,    it ubsequently  as increased. i but s w

MR. PARRY. Did  this rogram  produce  a  default  f  any  loan? p o

MR.  SPILLENKOTHEN. No.

MR.  PARRY. Then how can  the  investments  e  a part f PC b o D [debt reviously p contracted],  rgil? Vi

MR.  MATTINGLY. They were anticipating  at he  market  would move and that th t they  would  lose heir  osition.  he DPC  exemption  does  not  require  n actual  efault.  he t p T a d T exemption  is  also vailable   anticipation    a  default. a in of

MR.  STERN. Another  form of ollateral! c

MR.  SPILLENKOTHEN. It  looks s  though  their  urrent  ositions e  covered y a c p ar b collateral,   the  issue s otential ture  xposure n  these arkets.  I  have  to  pin  these umbers but i p fu e i m n down, but  from the  numbers I've  een, t ooks  as  though  they id  a pretty  ood  job f  getting s i l d g o collateral    cover heir  ark-to-market  ositions. t  the  potential  ture  xposures eem rather to t m p Bu fu e s large,  nd if  hey ere  to  materialize der  these arket  conditions  ne  has  to onder where  any a t w un m o w collateral  uld come from  in  the uture.  hat  is art f  the  problem. wo f T p o

MR. PARKINSON. I  would like  o  draw  an analogy. s you  may know,  we use  the t A VAR  model to  measure  market  risk.  he danger  is hat his nalysis  oes  not  cover otential T t t a d p losses  n  extremely olatile tuations.    those arkets  we have  to  do stress  esting   uncover i v si In m t to what  exposures re  there. he same distinction mportant  ere,  nd  I  think t ies  t  the eart a T is  i h a i l a h of  the roblem.  LTCM p is sing  a  VAR-type model,  the ame basic echnology s  our  VAR,  to u s t a measure  potential ture  xposure. ut  that  odel estimates  xposure n  normal  markets n the fu e B m e i o

basis f  one-day  movements,  perhaps  at   95 percent  onfidence  evel. t oes  not  deal ith  the o a c l I d w kind  of  markets e are  seeing oday.  The latter  e xtremely  olatile d  currently ry  illiquid. w t ar e v an ve For  example, eter isher  alked bout  equity  ption ositions. w, suppose nvestors ve  to P F t a o p No i ha close hose ositions t  and  try o  replace  hem  by  going  into  he  market.  There  is o  liquidity t p ou t t t n whatsoever n  that  arket.  It  is ompletely  lliquid.  hink  his mphasis  on initial  rgin i m c i I  t t e ma actually  s isplaced.  he reason s  that  f  nvestors d  decided o  collect itial  rgin, hey i m T i i i ha t in ma t would have  collected ough margin  to  cover heir  stimate  f otential ture  xposure.  By en t e o p fu e hypothesis, ey  seriously  nderestimated at  xposure,  o  they  would be  still  ft  ith  a serious th u th e s le w shortfall    their  argin. in m

MR.  FISHER.  All  this  elates   the  question  f  how this inancing  ot  to e  so  big r to o f g b and  nobody realized  t as happening. i w

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. What technically  ppens  in  that ind  of  model is  that ha k if e are  resting  the  last  ive ears f xperience  uring hich the  structure   the  markets s w on f y o e d w of i essentially  able, at s,  here ere  no severe ontractions    even  expansions, e  covariances st th i t w c or th that e are  going  to  pick p  out f hat  ive ears re  correct  ovariances  or hat  opulation  nd w u o t f y a c f t p a that nvironment. hat we were  dealing  ith  in  the  Russian ituation,    e look  at  the  data, e W w s ifw was something hat  learly  as not  a  simple, teady tate.  n  that  nvironment,  he  coefficients t c w s s I e t in  an econometric odel either  ollapse  o  zero  or  to  one.  If e took  the ovariance  atrix hat m c t w c m t would be  implicit   that  nvironment,  t  ould give holly  different  sk  arameters  han  we in e i w w ri p t would get  in  a  system n  which we are aking  ive ears f  special  xperience  nd  saying he i t f y o e a t losses  ere  never  more than "x"  on a daily  asis. o what? That  begs  the  question  f  what will w b S o happen  in  the uture. f

MS. RIVLIN.  That  is hat  stress  esting  ll bout. w t isa a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes,  exactly.

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. We  have  to  be  very areful  ecause  as c b horrendous s  this  xperience  as,  if  e assume  that he ormal  market  is hat he ussians re a e w w t n t t R a going  to  default  nce  a week,  the  cost f apital  ould go  so  high  that  obody would ever nvest o o c w n i in  anything.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That  is he  whole  point. hese  are  very  special  ases. t T c In  fact,  s  some of y  colleagues  now,  my  favorite eech  is ne  where  I  discuss  eparating e a m k sp o s th risks  hat  onfront  he  monetary  authority om  the  risks  hat  he  commercial  banks  have  to  face. t c t fr t t I  have  always  argued  that  he  commercial  banks  are  responsible r 9.95  percent  f he  risks t fo 9 o t with  their  wn capital.  he rest  re hese 0-year vents,  hich the  central  ank  will andle. o T a t 5 e w b h The trouble  s  that  his  s hat  this  vent learly s. i t i w e c wa

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That  was very  wise.  Al Broaddus.

MR. BROADDUS. I  didn't ve  a  question, st   15-second omment in  the  context ha ju a c of  this ommittee's roader esponsibility. l,  would  not  second-guess  our  decision  or C b r Bil I y f a minute.  It s he  most  natural  hing  n  the  world  to  respond o  a  request  or ur ood offices   a i t t i t f o g in situation ke  his. ut  this  ind  of  action oes  create  xpectations th  respect  o  what  we might li t B k d e wi t do  going  forward hat  n  turn reate  xpectations out onetary  policy.  o,  this  ssue  learly t i c e ab m S i c is an  FOMC matter n  my view,  and I  appreciate  eing  brought o  this  ommittee.

MR.  BROADDUS. Right.  Against hat ackground, t ight  be  constructive r s  to t b i m fo u have a  discussion  t  some point  n  which we would  explicitly ress he  tradeoff d  how  we a i add t an balance he  need  to  intervene  n  a  crisis. t i
