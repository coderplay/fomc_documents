of the MR. POTTER. 1   Thank you, Madam Chair.  As part of the annual review Committee's authorizations for domestic open market operations and foreign currency transactions, and as discussed in the memo titled 'Request for Votes on

Authorization for Desk Operations' recommends to highlight one additional item for In January 2009, the Committee suspended the Open Market Operations in Federal-Agency to purchase agency debt and agency The SOMA contains a significant amount of agency debt and agency MBS, these guidelines.  No Committee vote is needed to continue the In addition to these proposed changes, I'd like the Committee's consideration: Guidelines for the Conduct of System Issues in light of the Federal Reserve's programs MBS. and it continues to conduct transactions in agency MBS as part of the reinvestment policy adopted by the Committee.  Consequently, I recommend a continued suspension of suspension.

text and structure of the document, with the aim of simplifying the language so it can be more easily understood by the public.  None of these changes affect the domestic authorization. With respect to the domestic authorization, we recommend two sets of changes. In the first set of changes, FRBNY and Board staff collaborated on proposed updates to the that authority delegated or the policies outlined in the we recommend a set of revisions affect some of the authority outlined in the domestic changes that were highlighted in my memo, to go over a change in the authorization that I failed to removal of explicit references to types of counterparties.

The inconsistent and makes distinctions between counterparty types relevant.  To address this, we removed references to In the existing domestic authorization, outright transactions are authorized with 'securities dealers,' while the term 'dealer' is used to describe authorized counterparty types for the securities lending program and customer transactions conducted via the FRBNY account.  It is not clear what the distinction should be between these counterparty types and whether it should be authorized to transact with the Desk.  In particular, the primary dealer policy of the New York Fed explicitly allows for and federally regulated banks to be temporary open market operations existing language is that may no longer be counterparties altogether.

Further, the proposed change would not proposed streamlined language, the the current framework for Although this change could theoretically broaden the Desk's wider range the existing language affect our existing practice, and, even under the Desk would not add or remove counterparty types or alter managing counterparties without seeking FOMC approval.  This change was not

Please see in your handout titled 'Material for Briefing on Proposed Revisions to the right panel.  The insertions in bracketed blue text that can be made to existing authority on counterparties; please see paragraphs 1, 3, and 4. If you prefer, we can retain the existing references to counterparties. the exhibit Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations,' which compares the existing language on the left panel and the proposed language on the proposed language contains three retain the related to the desire to clarify existing practice.  The fourth change is a large total amount of commercial bank reserves. Returning to the four changes described in the memo, the first three of these changes are intended to update the language to account for the current operating model in which there is

As the Desk now conducts all no longer requires this authority. The first change introduces proposed for all FOMC organizational documents and it amounts to prudent planning to simplify Bank selected by the Committee in the event of second change removes paragraph 3, which authorizes the Selected Bank to transact in agency MBS through agents such trading in agency MBS internally, it the Desk's make any such U.S. Treasury securities, This clarifies that the collateral pledged must be of equal or to the collateral borrowed.  Note that while the Selected Bank would lending against cash collateral on a this authority beyond current practice without the lending program U.S. Treasury securities as collateral, although cash is accepted on an as part of the settlement process.  Cash is accepted overnight only in a counterparty fails to deliver a security. The third proposed change defines the types of collateral accepted in securities lending operation.  The existing language does not specification.  The new language specifies that, for a loan of counterparties can pledge only U.S. Treasury securities or cash; for a loan of U.S. agency securities, counterparties can pledge U.S. agency securities, U.S. Treasury securities, or cash. superior quality now have the authority to conduct securities regular basis, it would not exercise prior approval of the FOMC.

to comment on the counterparty matter that Simon raised our conversation yesterday about this.  Clearly, the had in the previous authorization wasn't ideal.  The term 'dealer' is there for defined.  It has a common-sense English language meaning, think is plausibly restrictive in the sense that there are some counterparties you it seemed, at first blush, to be removing an important constraint on the Desk.  I totally Desk not to expand the typical counterparties of open market operations and of repo and Committee.  I totally get that.  But my that we do include the bracketed items.  The Committee needs a chance to understand are.  There's a study under way of the entire counterparty framework, and Committee deal with a good thing.  But we should probably await that before we make any MR. LACKER.  Yes.  I'd like at the beginning of his remarks, as part of situation we historical reasons.  It's not precisely however, that I could imagine that wouldn't qualify as dealers in the plain-English version of the meaning of the word.  So trust the securities lending operations without consulting the concern is that making this change with such short notice doesn't seem advisable.  So I'd advocate what the implications rationalizing how the authorization and other documentary devices of the counterparties would be substantive change.

So until we actually get through more work to understand thisFriday evening-I'd urge that we retain the status quo by including the the proposed directive.  And I should mention that I fully support all of the This is a substantive change that will appear plastered over the front take notice, wonder what this implies about the Committee's intentions for the capability of expanding counterparties of the Desk's operations and in view of the very short amount of time the Committee has had to digest these documents that were posted bracketed phrasing in other changes in the directive.

Let me ask if there are other comments on the matter that President has raised here.  President Kocherlakota. CHAIR YELLEN. Lacker

Thank you, Madam Chair.  I won't go back over the same President Lacker covered.  I'll just say that I echo what he had to say.  Whenever we kind, we should have an opportunity to have careful deliberation over it, to keep the status quo for that reason.  Similarly, I don't know if I would this meeting, but I think that, with the technological changes that have occurred in it would not be feasible for the Committee members to be called on to decide on a really any reason left to give those extraordinary powers to the MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. ground that change language of this and so I would prefer counsel this at the past 15 years, it's reasonable for the Committee to rethink whether there are any situations in which monetary policy issue.  Is there

January 27-28, 2015

not suggesting that at this meeting, but I would advise the Committee to have that Chair?  I'm issue on the table in a sufficiently timely fashion for next year.

YELLEN.  I think the thought was a true emergency-an attack on the United like that. CHAIR States or something

It would be useful to have a discussion of what the scenarios MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. are that we're thinking about.

YELLEN.  Any other comments on the authorization?  [No response]  Well, proposal, and I take it that it's acceptable to the Desk to include the language that's many people-I'd like a show of hands-would like to include CHAIR we've had a in blue and currently bracketed.  Two members of the Committee have spoken in favor of that. Let me ask everybody else, how the blue bracketed language?

a choice on page 4, right? You would choose 'dealers' if you wanted to keep the existing if you wanted to modernize the VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Just one interjection.  We have MR. POTTER.  Yes. language.  You would choose 'market counterparties' authorization fully.

What is in your recommendation? VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

If you choose 'market counterparties,' you don't accept any of the other MR. POTTER. insertions.  If you accept the first two insertions, you would choose 'dealers.'

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. MR. POTTER.  Yes.

I see.  I think we're saying 'dealers,' then, in that case.

'Dealers' is the status quo. MR. LACKER.  I agree.

to clarify that. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I just wanted

[Show of hands]  Okay.  And is anyone opposed to keeping it [No response]  Okay.  I'm assuming, then, that we will keep the blue language.

YELLEN.  That's correct.  These are documents that, even in the case of the have been in place now for a large number of years, and we're timing and the blizzard of materials.  The staff is pretty overwhelmed in I think it's worthwhile for them to hear that we feel-and I feel us as a blizzard.  But I also hope you'll recognize the strains that to produce this gigantic amount of material for our consideration.

Maybe I'm missing the changes to the Program for Security believe it's going to allow participants to be able to talk about their than in the past-or maybe I misunderstood the sense of that language MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam description of what was in these changes.  I thought that the of FOMC Information, while I welcome them, are perhaps a little more substantive than was outlined, in the sense that I forecasts more openly change.

It the security rules that we've written down, for you to give a comfortable for some with Reserve Bank presidents going out and giving outlook speeches in which they talk going to happen.  We Reserve Banks posting information about their forecasts-the even, implicitly at least, their president's forecast-on their websites, and so this acknowledging that. MR. ENGLISH.  I think our intention there was Bank president can go out and talk about his or her outlook for the economy, and that Reserve Banks can, as they already have been, post would still not be appropriate, under speech and say, 'Here is what I submitted to the SEP.'  But we have been time about their sense of the outlook, why it is what it is, and what they think is have also been comfortable with staff forecast or was clear that some of the Banks may want to have some of this information basically been rewritten to acknowledge the situation that I think we're in. I want to be subject to Bank security rules.  These are the FOMC's security rules, and the FOMC's security rules have

It's a fairly substantive change, then, in how we're going to approach MR. PLOSSER. this.

It actually isn't.  That's been true-that was true with the old rules. just maintaining that.  But we're saying that you could go out and talk more broadly about MR. ENGLISH. We're

That's where we drew the line.  Admittedly, it's slightly arbitrary, but it seemed to us that once you submit that to the SEP, then it really is FOMC information-it's at meetings, and so on.  Whereas, if it's

edge, it's bound to be a MR. ENGLISH.  We're trying to draw a line here, and, at the little bit fuzzy.

MR. LACKER.  I'm not driven by that ambiguity to question the policy regarding what we say in public.  I'm driven to think about why so much of the SEP is confidential.  And maybe that's what deserves some reconsideration.

The only change to the statement before you from the version endorsed last year is the longer-run unemployment rate from the SEP.

All of I see it as constitutional in nature, the authors, some of which are obvious to the which are less so.  It's not reasonable to expect it to resolve all differences.

Yet, purported to agree with that in discussion, there was an statement, which I think would have been and would have provided not only some real guidance to the public, but also a we have in this Committee.  So I guess more convinced than ever that this statement reflects an agreement on language, without any monetary policy, something that is of particular significance build on some of what said, even though I come out differently. MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As everyone knows, I've abstained in the past during the vote on this statement.  I have because there's been a virtually objective is symmetrical around the 2 percent target. concern was the failure to specify a symmetric loss function mandate.

I'll be the first to admit that there are still a lot of ambiguities in to amend to suit our own particular approach to call it a success.  Indeed, one could say that the document itself takes a approach.  It balances the need to encompass the diversity of views among participants I've been a staff member of the subcommittee.  So I know firsthand all of compromise that went into crafting the statement.  Of course, I'm not a fan of we've got to the statement, and we each could find parts policymaking.  But I still think that if we view it as a consensus statement and a consensus set of principles, I would balanced with the need to convey important information about the Committee's policy goals and framework.

Looking beyond liftoff, expectations through 2017 declined modestly in the most recent surveys.  These declines may reflect rate, increases, pause the lower bound.

Beginning with TDFs, as outlined in the bottom-left panel, the staff proposes conducting a series of three test operations, beginning in February and maturing by mid-March.  The operations would incorporate two changes relative thus far.  First, they would introduce participation and allow the effects of the tool to be realized more quickly. Second, the proposed operations would have overlapping maturities so that the quantity of outstanding TDFs would gradually increase.  The individual award per operation to $20 billion and offering a spread of 3 basis points over the wish to conduct in order to test refinements to the term RRP With respect to further testing of term RRPs, the Committee may operations at the March quarter-end operational framework.  If the Committee thought it appropriate to do so, the Desk proposes testing that incorporates four operational refinements, which are based on lessons learned from the tests over year-end and outlined in your bottom-right panel.

For example, depending on the preferred approach for the initial stage of normalization, the Committee may don't span quarter-ends.  The Committee offer a few consecutive term RRPs, learn more about the extent to which term RRPs controlling short-term effect that changes market rates, volumes, and overnight additional insight into the desired setting of the The Committee might also be interested in further testing the in the overnight RRP rate have on short-term RRP take-up, which could provide IOER-overnight RRP rate spread during normalization.

facility regularly at quarter-end.  This is buried in the back of the tension we've faced throughout the time we've We've wanted to learn more.  It's a genuinely positive benefit of testing.  But, at MR. LACKER.  Yes.  I'm going to make a procedural suggestion, Madam Chair.  This has to do with RRP testing.  According to the January Survey of Primary Dealers, they already believe we will offer a term primary dealer survey.  This has to do with this been testing. the same time, we've been anxious about the extent to which testing encourages broad

January 27-28, 2015

a relatively permanent or overly large facility that's going to persist for some ahead of where the Committee is on the likelihood of using it.  We even actually decided this yet.  I note that our next agenda item, agenda item 9, is where memo presented us with an option 1 and an term RRPs.  It's an option I favor, and I think we can do fine with a larger cap and a wide spread to 25 basis points, as I'll argue later. expectation of time.  And it looks as though, again, our testing over the year-end of a term RRP facility has led expectations to run a bit haven't we're going to discuss our liftoff options.  The staff option 2, and option 1 does without without that, test again a term facility at quarter-end might be think we're likely to use it on an ongoing basis when we rates.  Now, I understand that there's the standard boilerplate whenever we announce these the cows come home and it doesn't mean anything about how when we actually liftoff.  But, in point of fact, we see that what we do majority of the option 1 and views us as likely to be able to lift off quite smoothly use of term RRPs, it might be useful to forgo testing term RRPs.  I'd like to suggest, have a better sense of where the But our decision about whether we usefully informed about whether we raise things, and that we can test until we're going to do things leads markets to expect us to use the things we test and roll out.  So, if the Committee coalesces around without the Madam Chair, that we defer consideration of this resolution on testing term RRPs until we've had this discussion and go-round on liftoff tools and we Committee wants to head.

up to the Chair. MR. LACKER.  Ask the Chair.  It's

MR. POTTER.  Can I just give you some background?

CHAIR YELLEN.  Please, Simon.

One of the things that we're trying to deal with is to avoid indicating MR. POTTER. anything in our testing about whether a meeting is 'live' or not.  Consequently, one of the things

January 27-28, 2015

offer the possibility of using the term over a quarter-end.  We that we could come out of this with.  I agree with you that it would be useful to find out whether that's correct in the as if the testing that we did was changing people's regarding our footprint or whether the overnight RRP will be permanent.  The buythe amount of overnight RRP that they thought we would be suggest that this will be permanent. we're trying to do in option 1 is to thought that this particular resolution was the minimal testing meeting go-round coming up.  But it's not expectations side respondents actually reduced using, and we have not heard anyone

CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman.

DUDLEY.  I'm pretty sympathetic to what you're saying, President the sense that, if the Committee decides determinatively that it's not going to use the adopt that facility.  It seems to me that one reason why the markets were more likely was that the tests seemed to show that they were helpful floor under money market rates.  I don't believe it's reasonable to think that we of inferences from whether the tests go well or VICE CHAIRMAN Lacker, in something, then it doesn't make sense to keep testing it, because that leads to the wrong inference by the markets.  But, at the same time, it's not unreasonable for the markets to see how well the tests do and, from how well the tests do, make inferences about how likely Committee is to actually might think term RRPs in putting a could force the markets not to draw those kinds the tests go not so well.  They're going to respond to how they see their experience with the test.

the liftoff tools.  The time to have this discussion is where we're headed more broadly. MR. LACKER.  Madam Chair, I'm happy to debate testing, but I think we should just wait a few minutes and do it after we discuss after we have a sense of

January 27-28, 2015

Personally, I think it's fine if we defer the vote on the testing of the discussion of liftoff tools.  Do I see any objections to that? CHAIR YELLEN. term RRPs until we're done with the Okay.  President Rosengren.

MR. ROSENGREN.  Governor Tarullo looks as though he's about to do a two-hander.

I wanted to ask whether we can still ask questions now about the the later discussion. MR. TARULLO.  Yes. testing to inform

TARULLO.  I just wanted to make sure.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Of course.  Yes, please.

MR.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes-absolutely.  Do you have a question?

MR. TARULLO.  I do, but Eric's first.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Of course.

My question follows on with that line of questioning of President experience over year-end, if you were to tally the financial cost of using much we than overnight?  Just approximately.  The second part that there may be an inference that there's a difference from a financial stability you see the financial stability differences between using overnight using term reverses? MR. ROSENGREN. Lacker's.  Based on our term reverse repos instead of overnight, do we have a rough approximation of how spent by choosing to do it with term rather to that is standpoint between term and overnight.  So, based on your experience with year-end, could you give me a sense of how reverses and it's easier if I answer the first question now.  The second might be the discussion of liftoff tools. MR. POTTER.  I think more appropriate in

fine. MR. ROSENGREN.  Okay.  That's

January 27-28, 2015

exercise you'd have to do is the Suppose we'd increased over the year-end the cap on the overnight RRP to $600 of going out at probably an average rate of 9 basis points, assuming we didn't hit times $225 billion.  I I don't think it's that much of a difference in terms of the the Federal Reserve. MR. POTTER.  On the first one, the counterfactual following: billion.  That would be the same amount of collateral available.  Then the $225 billion that was in term, instead the cap, would have gone out at 5 basis points.  So that's 4 basis points don't know if Josh can work that out. income of how it worked in markets, there's some evidence that it has some social value it gives people that it will allow for smoother market functioning and less what we is probably preferred. In terms of due to the confidence disruption.  But, overall, if the two tools achieve the same rate control, that's probably should look at primarily.  And if they do, given that and market functioning, the one that's slightly cheaper to use

CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman.

on that point, how much learning do you think markets as they saw how the different term operations are perceived?  Because one can pricing occurs and what the demand is, whereas if you just have the overnight the operation actually materializes.  I'd about whether you think there was learning and whether that was helpful. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Simon, there was by advantage of the term facility, in principle, is that you have these operations, and the market see how the operation, at the end of the year, you know nothing until be curious

We heard from market participants that some learning took place, and third one, wasn't oversubscribed-that the yearmarket participants to indicate demand would have been met on the year-end MS. LOGAN. they realized-as the operation, particularly the end pressures were going to be fairly smooth.  But if you pressed whether they were fully confident that all of the

January 27-28, 2015

when there's uncertainty about whether the cap is high enough to accommodate date with a larger overnight RRP cap, I'm not sure they would have preferred the term over the overnight.  So that demand on overnight, that's what you would be weighing against increased knowledge by having the term earlier.

MR. POTTER.  But I think the money funds do prefer higher rates.

MR. ROSENGREN.  Just one follow-up on that, if I may.  If we had no cap on year-end for overnight, would that have served the same purpose?

MS. LOGAN.  Yes.

Chair.

MR. FISHER.  Madam

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Fisher.

MR. FISHER.  Just to clarify, are question.

they fairly close substitutes or not?  That's my

LACKER.  Yes-I think that was a 'yes.' MR.

MR. POTTER.  Fantastic question.  [Laughter]

MR. FISHER.  And the answer is?

to a greater extent about the degree of more against certain scenarios in which the financial stability implications is, I believe, a topic Jim is going to go into. MS. LOGAN.  I think we're going to talk substitution.  From an actual operations perspective in this particular briefing, there is complexity in operating the term as opposed to just having an overnight that can be used.  How you want to weigh those may be different

But you were asking from the standpoint of the investor, VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. weren't you, Richard?

January 27-28, 2015

From the investor's standpoint, they like the flexibility of the overnight their cash flows can be variable, and they have the opportunity to put it in so that they can even use every hour within the day to make a decision MS. LOGAN. products because then daily and make daily adjustments.  When we were designing this, the overnight RRP was as late in the day as possible about whether they're going to invest with the Federal Reserve.

can predict that the sheet will be going down.  That's available to them.  So the substitution between any different. MR. POTTER.  I think quarter-end is a little bit different in that they balance overnight and term, then, is one set of cases.  What might be interesting is to learn, away from the quarter-end, is whether the substitution looks

MR. LACKER.  Madam Chair?

CHAIR YELLEN.  Go ahead.

I want to follow up on President Rosengren's question, the crux of sufficiently large cap, they have virtually identical effects and an identical and that they view them as perfect substitutes.  I take it that the market rates would be about the same as well. MR. LACKER. which was that, with a effect on the counterparties, effect on said, market MS. LOGAN.  I don't think they're viewed as perfect substitutes.  As I particpants like just having the overnight products.

market rates is likely to be the same either way-the term versus a large cap? MR. LACKER.  Yes.  Sure, they'd love a term instrument from us.  But, aside from that, the effect on

If I could follow up, there was funds rate.  I'm being sarcastic-I'm You don't view that as much get where we're going to go anyway, right?

the consensus statement we adopted earlier MR. LACKER.  No, our objectives are in today.

Principles and Plans, which you trading in that range. MR. POTTER.  I think that, in the Policy Normalization voted into effect in September, you did express the wish that this tool be used to support the federal funds rate explosions and implosions all the time.  And I don't recall that ever being brought to the something that required a new facility. MR. LACKER.  But I'm thinking that, before the crisis, we had quarter-end and year-end rate Committee as a matter of concern or

LOGAN. What we were trying to test, if you look at panel 19, was whether there the dark-blue line in the days leading into quarter-end.  In the old days, as might have had volatility on quarter-end, but you may be uncomfortable-and I very interesting-about the extent to which that had influence on other days beyond case, we didn't see that dynamic at the year-end.  Now, it could have just that leakage going into quarter-end, and I agree that on one day, if it's MS. was a difference in you suggest, we think that's that one day.  In this been because we surprised market participants in September.  So, again, we don't know that for sure.  But we didn't see just one day, that's probably not so much of a concern.

January 27-28, 2015

Yes.  A broader point is that-I don't want to belabor this, but it's old regime, it was predictable.  The rates would crash or spike or whatever, and was relevant to the things in the consensus statement, things like two-year rates and oneMR. LACKER. obvious-in the what year rates, would smooth through that.  So year-end never really had any economic consequence that I remember.

that other jurisdictions-the United think what you may be are those days leading into the quarter-end-that it is more than just one day. MS. LOGAN.  I agree about that day, and we saw Kingdom and the euro area-had volatility on their year-end date.  I concerned about with a adequate to provide ample comfort to market participants to MR. LACKER.  Right.  And you've provided the information that an overnight sufficiently large cap would be smooth market function enough.

Of course, the related issue, President Lacker, is that if we didn't care.  But at this point, liftoff clearly work is a little higher than normal. MR. POTTER.  As long as it's available for some time before the year-end as well. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. we actually do lift off in June or September and quarter-end is coming up right behind that liftoff, having rates move up-and do so pretty consistently-is probably more important than at other times.  I certainly accept your point that at past year-ends our credibility in terms of actually making the So we would probably care more about quarter-end pressure and year-end pressure now than we would in past episodes.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Agreed.

think there's something a little circumstances. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I take your point, but I special about these

January 27-28, 2015

for the days before the quarter-end, because between, for tell the difference between the liftoff pull and the actual quarter-end effect.  So I think is particularly of interest. MS. LOGAN.  Particularly example, the June meeting and the quarter-end, if it leaked into the days before, you wouldn't be able to that window true-quarter-end is about one week rates.  But quarter-end effects are pretty well known in financial markets.  Some is bound to come across somebody saying 'usual quarter-end pressure.'  A month later, I don't see it as a really MR. LACKER.  Can I follow up on this?  Yes, it's after the June meeting, and there might be some articles in the paper the next day if we have a little crash in reporter is it going to be a problem if rates behave the normal way after that? serious reputational risk for us.

DUDLEY.  I guess it's probably not a very serious reputational risk, reputational risk from manifesting itself, why it? VICE CHAIRMAN but if you have a good tool to prevent that wouldn't you want to use

Lorie said, no one has done this before.  Suppose we noise around it, and it's going to be very confusing for MR. POTTER.  President Lacker, as are lifting rates.  There's going to be people if we don't actually lift rates.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Exactly.

We could try to say it's quarter-end. MR. POTTER.

Wait.  So you're talking about one day a week after we raise rates. MR. LACKER.

No.  It's the pressure of quarter-end leading into that day.  That can put There's some controversy as to MR. POTTER. downward pressure on rates.  That's what we saw in September. the source of that.

Was it 3 basis points? MR. LACKER.

January 27-28, 2015

But remember the zero.  There's a zero line in here.  Zero is getting a lot and zero is a big push-off as well.  We really don't want-I directive you've given us-to have a lot of of raising rates.

But after six years of being at zero and and do what it CHAIR YELLEN.  Agreed.

I would say, President Lacker, that you're analogies to previous periods that were completely different from the going to be facing.  We are in uncharted territories, and market participants are going to be watching this with a different set of system and because we're lifting off

January 27-28, 2015

think we have historical examples of that in the United States.  Right lower bound behavior we saw at quarter-end in September should lead us to be very concerned that, after an announcement by this Committee that we're lifting off, we could actually see rates that we're quite confident could prevent it.  The following question would tools? years now.  I just don't now, we are getting support from the zero lower bound, but you'll be moving that up.  The right drifting down for several days in a row.

YELLEN.  Governor Tarullo, did you have a quick question? CHAIR

actually Eric's second question, which Simon I think President Lacker MR. TARULLO.  My question was suggested was best deferred to the discussion of liftoff options, a topic has already taken us into.  [Laughter]

I was dragged into it. MR. LACKER.

I have a feeling that Jim will address that question in the MR. TARULLO.  But presentation, so I will defer.

YELLEN.  Are there any other questions?  President Plosser. CHAIR

I have two really quick observations.  One is that we're worried about to quarter-end.  We can solve that problem by lifting rid of it.  Don't lift off near the year-end.  I'm being a bit MR. PLOSSER. lifting off in June or September, very close off in April or July.  [Laughter]  Get

January 27-28, 2015

the way we approach the structure of has to do with quarter-end behavior, it seems the wrong way to design the program. in a particular way to start doing that, I'm worried we'll find repeating this, and we actually will have adopted a practice that we didn't have before, to pull back on. facetious here, but my point is, if the only reason to change the program For example, if we choose to lift off in June and we choose to do things avoid the quarter-end problem that we're talking about, what will then be the expectations in the market about subsequent quarter-ends?  Once we ourselves which is smoothing quarter-end.  So I think it's tricky on both sides.  Once you venture into that fray and start that practice, we may find it that much harder then to pull back on this program that we've said we want

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Fisher.

one-off, Madam Chair, but I want to come back to the previous that Simon wrote-on your own or with the Desk-and I praised.  I simply want to ask the question:  Have we had any change in our expectation as to reduce it? MR. FISHER.  This is a meeting we had and the excellent memo that to the ultimate size of the balance sheet and then the speed with which we expect

$4.27 trillion at par.  While we are investing, it'll On the path of mortgage-backed securities, as Lorie showed you, it looks few months.  So that's going to generate some rates eventually firm as we lift off, you might effect on how quickly the MBS run off.  But that was part of the analysis in that MBS are two factors there.  What does the stock of MBS that we're holding at the stop reinvestment look like?  And what are rates after that?  So we're going to get MR. POTTER.  The balance sheet is stay around that level. as though prepays will be quite high for the next lower coupons in there, which means that, if the see a very small memo:  A lot of getting the balance sheet back to a more normal size depends on the runoff, and there moment we slightly more lower-coupon MBS from this prepayment increase.

for the staff presentation, I want to make a couple of comments myself.  First, I'll say again consider it absolutely critical that, when we announce liftoff, the federal funds range in a smooth, efficient, and prompt manner.  Personally, Okay.  We're next going to turn to liftoff tools and options, and, before turning it over to Jim that, personally, I rate move into our increased target I think we need a very high degree of confidence that our normalization tools, in whatever configuration we settle on, will provide sufficient control over interest rates right out of the gate. To me, this is the highest priority.

policy tools vary in terms of their benefits, costs, and risks.  So we clearly in their use.  While we may differ to some degree in weighing be best served by an operational plan that's relatively simple Second, our need to strike the right balance these various factors, I believe we'll to implement and communicate.  For liftoff to go smoothly, it seems essential that market participants will need to have a reasonable idea of what types of investment opportunities will be available to them.  Of course, the plan needs to be feasible for the Desk to execute with manageable operational risk.

staff memo, the particular choices we make about our tools at the tools, such as the cap on the overnight RRP facility, with the expectation the potential size of the facilities over time as we learn more about what's RRPs outside quarter-ends for reliance on the overnight RRP Third, as noted in the time of liftoff need not constrain us subsequently.  I am quite amenable to temporary alterations in the parameters of our that we will dial back needed to put a firm floor under rates once we move away from the zero lower bound.  For example, we could substitute term facility.

my own, I look forward to hearing your views, But with those preliminary comments of and I'm next going to turn the floor over to Jim for a presentation.

Chair.  I'll be referring to the MR. CLOUSE. 4   Thank you very much, Madam handout labeled 'Material for Discussion of Liftoff Tools and Possible Liftoff Options.'

of its high-level approach to policy yet described exactly how it plans to principles and plans.  To facilitate issues, the staff prepared a memo that highlights some key may wish to consider in this regard.  An underlying theme of may face some tradeoffs in developing an operational minimizing the risks that could be associated As noted in exhibit 1, in its Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, the Committee provided a broad outline normalization.  However, the Committee has not use its various tools to implement these general your discussion of these issues that policymakers the memo is that policymakers strategy for liftoff that seeks to maximize the odds that liftoff will proceed smoothly from the start while, at the same time, with heavy reliance on particular tools.

those issues further, the memo outlined two illustrative options that in their relative reliance on overnight and term RRP operations.  As first box in exhibit 2, the recent testing of term RRPs around the year-end in this way.  The year-end tests that there was an important degree of substitutability between overnight If that substitution relationship holds at times as well, it may be possible to use term RRP operations to help manage the take-up in overnight RRP operations.  In addition, term RRP operations auction.  As a result, the financial stability risks may be viewed as lower than those associated reverse repo operations.  On the other hand, term RRP To explore differ primarily noted in the provided the backdrop for structuring the options suggested RRP and term RRP, at least at the year-end. other level of the would be fixed in size, they would be offered only on specific dates, and the rate would always be determined at associated with term RRP operations with daily overnight

term RRP could result in distortions in term financing markets.  In operations with maturities that extend over FOMC meeting dates operations are more operationally complex than overnight RRP operations, and heavy reliance on addition, term RRP could present some potential challenges in avoiding perceptions of signaling policy actions in advance.

in mind, as shown in the middle box, under the first of reverse operations at the time of liftoff to establish a floor for overnight rates.  For this support for short-term interest rates, market participants assurance that the aggregate cap on overnight reverse repos shifts in investor preferences, the FOMC, in this option, increase the cap on overnight reverse repo that it intends to after liftoff, if necessary, to help control the federal reverse repo With these observations the two illustrative options, the FOMC would rely principally on overnight RP tool to provide effective would require sufficient would bind only rarely.  To provide this assurance while accounting for the possibility of significant would indicate its intention to temporarily operations to a level of, say, $600 billion.  (Again, the particular numbers here are purely hypothetical at this stage.)  In addition, the FOMC would note conduct term RRP operations funds rate and to help avoid scenarios in which the cap on overnight operations binds regularly.

to option 1 if they judged that the financial risks associated with a sizable temporary increase in the RRP cap are modest and were concerned that the costs of conducting reverse repo operations could be significant, or that the communications confident that they a situation in which a sizable temporary increase in the overnight RRP lived.  For example, policymakers might judge that the Federal in advance its intention to reduce the overnight reverse overnight reverse repo take-up did not increase much after liftoff and the reverse repo take-up term reverse repo book or take other steps to return the size of reverse repo operations and the overnight reverse repo cap to lower levels. Policymakers might be attracted stability and footprint overnight sizable term associated with undertaking term operations before liftoff could prove complicated. Policymakers might also be attracted to option 1 if they were could avoid cap became very long Reserve could communicate repo cap if additional capacity proved unnecessary.  In addition, if overnight were quite elevated following liftoff, policymakers could indicate an intention to build up a sizable overnight reverse repos as a supplementary tool and would indicate its the cap temporarily on overnight reverse repo operations by a more intends to conduct term reverse repo operations in advance of liftoff, to help ensure overnight reverse repo cap does not bind at liftoff and thereafter. Under option 2, shown in the far-right box, the FOMC would rely more heavily on the use of term intention to boost modest amount from, say, $300 billion to $400 billion.  In addition, it would note that it that the

to policymakers who were concerned that a sizable reverse large for an extended period.  For policymakers who reverse repo can be used to manage the size of the overnight Option 2 might be attractive increase in the overnight RRP cap, even if only temporary, could present financial stability and 'footprint risks' and might also send a signal that the overnight repo facility will remain quite are confident that term

reverse repo operations envisioned in risks. reverse repo program, the advance use of term option 2 might be viewed as an effective way to mitigate such reverse repo operations play an important in both options 1 and 2, this potential role hinges importantly on an assumption reverse repo can substitute for overnight reverse repo to a significant degree. may be useful to conduct additional tests of term reverse assumption is It bears emphasizing that, while term role that term As Lorie noted earlier, it repo away from quarter-ends to get a better handle on whether this correct.

over shortRRP rate, changes in the level of the IOER RRP rates relative to the target range for the federal funds rate, and the on short-term rates, but they have not figured prominently in the As noted in exhibit 3, apart from options 1 and 2, the memo notes some additional steps that policymakers could consider that might help to enhance control term rates at the time of liftoff.  These involve marginal adjustments in the spread between the IOER rate and the overnight and overnight possible use of term deposits.  All of these steps arguably could help put upward pressure Committee's discussions to date.

strategy the Committee chooses to adopt, the memo notes least some aspects of that strategy in conduct a smooth liftoff.  For example, it information about the likely calibrations of and the likely ways they would be used in combination.  This Whatever operational that policymakers may wish to communicate at advance to provide greater clarity to market participants and to enhance confidence that the Federal Reserve is well prepared to might be useful to provide additional policy tools information, for example, could be provided in the minutes of future meetings, the Chair's postmeeting press conference remarks, speeches, and testimonies.

interest on excess reserves that could raise some of excess reserve balances.  In a single interest rate-currently calculated as the arithmetic the maintenance period-that is assumed excess reserve balances.  As noted in the memo, this can create some maintenance periods in which policymakers may interest rate on excess reserves in the middle of the period. Shifting gears a bit, exhibit 4 summarizes some key takeaways from a memo that focused on aspects of the payment of issues at the time of liftoff.  Under our current approach, interest payments on excess reserves are based on the 14-day average concept particular, there is average interest rate on excess reserves over to apply over the entire reserve maintenance period in computing the payment of interest on complications during those reserve change the option, Reserve could change the length of the reserve maintenance period from IOER rate could then be aligned with the beginning it require thousands of depository institutions to change their internal option noted was to base rate on excess reserves for the entire maintenance period on the The memo offers a couple of possibilities for addressing this issue.  In one the Federal 14 days to 7 days.  As long as the FOMC continued to announce its policy decisions on Wednesdays, changes in the of a new reserve maintenance period.  This option is attractive in many respects, but would also systems to incorporate a 7-day maintenance period.  Another the effective interest

January 27-28, 2015

excess reserves rate at the end of the reserve maintenance period.  This the middle of a maintenance the FOMC's decision to raise the target range for the federal could also put upward pressure on the federal funds rate prior memo, is to base interest payments interest rate on excess reserves in interest on would help ensure that an increase in the IOER rate in period fully supports funds rate.  However, it to the FOMC announcement if it was at least partly anticipated by market participants.  A third option, not discussed in the more heavily on balances held each day and the effect each day.  This approach appears promising, and we are investigating the feasibility of that approach further.

repeats the questions for discussion during the go-round that added a question at the end that usefulness of additional testing of term reverse repo away the lines Lorie described earlier as a way to get a better and term reverse repo. your questions. The final exhibit were provided to you earlier.  In addition, we've seeks your views on the from quarter-ends along handle on the degree of substitution between overnight Thanks, and we'll be happy to take

Tarullo. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor ask the question, and President Rosengren may want to there a RRP? I'll provide a I guess I had implicitly assumed, without thinking too there would be a limitation on the rush for the exits from other investments if it was term, as opposed to overnight.  But, thinking about this matter led me to think that if the terms are short enough to be much benefit after all.  One way or another, as creating a model for money market funds or making it easier for them to do this are what they are.  But more overnight or term. MR. TARULLO.  Now I will piggyback on this as well.  Jim, getting back to that question that President Rosengren posed earlier, based on what we've seen so far and the analysis you've been able to do, is nontrivial financial-stability benefit of using term RRP as opposed to ON little bit of context for that question. much about it, that there was some benefit, if only because ability to further consistent with SEC rules, then maybe there's not long as we're providing a lot of absorption capacity, concerns about whether we are new maybe it doesn't make that much difference whether we use

how to minimize financial-stability concerns I guess the reason I think this is an important question is, if the answer is, 'Yes, there's not that much difference,' then we can talk about

January 27-28, 2015

to a doubling of ON RRP.  But at least that's the only thing to be discussed, as get a lot of benefit through a mix of the two.  I'm sorry, Eric.  Does that with respect opposed to whether we fairly capture your point?

MR. ROSENGREN.  Yes.  Why don't I do a follow-on after they address your question? MR. TARULLO.  Okay.

I should of murkiness regarding these issues of financial financial-stability arguments the overnight reverse repo suggested that there's an option value associated with it.  In markets are upset, investors can run to it because it's a standing more precisely, a standing facility with a cap that binds only in rare circumstances. it presents somewhat less of a financial-stability risk, go to it as readily.  It would be offered only on particular dates, not every is an auctioning financial-stability risks of the type we discussed regard to overnight reverse repo, but I think you could argue that it's probably somewhat MR. CLOUSE.  I'll offer my view, and Lorie and Simon may have others. preface my remarks by saying there's a little bit stability, so I should admit that up-front.  As you well know, the regarding the case when financial facility-or, For term reverse repo, you might argue that because people can't day.  Moreover, we'd be fixing the size that we would be auctioning.  In addition, there immediate price response.  If a crisis happened to occur on the day on which we were term reverse repo, that would drive down the rate that we would get on the term reverse repo.  So I certainly wouldn't argue that it's devoid of the with less.

a little bit of the flavor of the types of repo on a regular basis and putting some upward pressure on term rates, they would flee There may also be another aspect to it.  This has arguments that Governor Stein made about a crowding-out effect.  Insofar as you were auctioning term reverse you might induce some investors, like money funds, not to invest in things that

January 27-28, 2015

That, at the margin, might also reduce financial-stability risks.  It's very hard to from in a crisis. quantify this.

little bit lower if we had the term out there because with just the by itself. MR. POTTER.  I think that's a pretty good summary.  The other, simple part is that the amount of headroom that might be available in the overnight RRP, which is what people have been concerned about, would probably run a you still have the overnight RRP at the same time.  And the concern most people expressed around this table is just a big rush, around noon sometime, into the overnight RRP.  The idea would be to run with slightly lower headroom, on average, if we have the term than ON RRP

is a slightly different perspective, thinking in terms of the term That's what I was wondering. MR. TARULLO.  Although this stress building as opposed to happening in an instantaneous fashion.  If we're doing RRP, then, as in 2011, when the money market funds began to pull back, they get a couple of weeks to do it?

To me, the two situations depend entirely on how stable the overnight if it was completely stable and the headroom didn't change, stability of the daily take-up. MS. LOGAN. RRP take-up is.  As an example, then moving some of it to term doesn't really add any benefit.  If the overnight RRP take-up is very variable and moves around a lot, then moving some of it to term can improve financial stability because that headroom can fluctuate quite a bit.  So I think it depends on your assumption about the that seems clear from looking at the tables you attached January 22 memo is that it is virtually all about money market funds, right? MR. TARULLO.  But one thing to this

January 27-28, 2015

which move around MS. LOGAN.  Well, there's variability, particularly from the GSEs, a lot because of their payment dates.  But the money funds are fairly stable, except on quarterend, when you see the prime funds come in and really move around.

Right.  But I'm looking at the darkest-colored portion of the bars, Those are pretty small. MR. TARULLO. which were the 'other.'

tremendously when we lift off zero, and the dynamics MS. LOGAN.  But it could change could be very different.  We don't know how those dynamics will evolve.

leaves me, but thank you. MR. TARULLO.  I'm not sure where that

President Rosengren. CHAIR YELLEN.

To follow up, on your illustrative option 1 on page 2, the second the interest on excess reserves could be raised at that point.  The memo was the situation after liftoff. term, why couldn't we use IOER if we were finding that it was softer than that point?  The memos seem to have a preference for the IOER.  I just wanted to see if that was accurate or not, because I initial high-level position was that we were going to rely primarily on IOER, and this a little bit. MR. ROSENGREN. bullet is assuming that the term reverse repo is the preferred way to snug up the rates.  The other option would be that looking at the spread prior to liftoff, but I'm thinking more in terms of Rather than using the we expected and make an adjustment at term over adjustments with thought our seems to change that mean that.  We framed these two options because the results are with respect to behavior the new potential for possibly some substitution between that you would have a number of MR. CLOUSE.  No.  I'm sorry if we gave you that impression.  We certainly didn't to suggest around the year-end and because of overnight and reverse repo.  But you're absolutely right possible options that you could take after liftoff to snug up rates:  One might be raising the

January 27-28, 2015

another might be raising the overnight RRP rate, and still another might be raising them IOER, both.

relates to the right now, investors seem to anticipate that the IOER would be at the top of the federal would be at the bottom of the range.  Most to the federal funds target range.  Some people there could then be some confusion around having multiple rates.  You have a funds rate target range and an administered IOER rate that was at 55 basis points instead could be a multiplicity of rates there that you might worry about. certainly a possibility to do that. One potential issue you might face that you all have discussed previously fact that funds rate range, and that the overnight RRP rate participants seem to have agreed with this, and it's in the minutes.  So if you'd be moving IOER after liftoff, you would be bumping it up relative might argue that federal of 50 basis points, and so there But it's

issue, too.  It's one thing having a another thing having a system that to it. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think there's another system in place that you introduce ex ante, and it works.  It's you put in place, and then, ex post, you make adjustments

Rosengren was suggesting that we would stay there. Well-except our rules were focused on the federal funds rate, you could have had a strategy in which you set the IOER and with the IOER, but that was not the consensus around the table.  I'm a the primary objective is to hit a federal funds rate range, and IOER is our primary tool.  So I would have thought, with those two rules, MR. POTTER.  I think President MR. ROSENGREN. which wouldn't have been my preference, actually.  But, given that focus, it seems as though it would be the IOER.  Alternatively, didn't make adjustments little puzzled by the discussion.  We've said target in the

January 27-28, 2015

I would have actually been moving the IOER for a technical adjustment after the fact, if it that turned out that we were using reverses more than we expected.

we should be doing.  Two of the issues are, if it's ex ante, that's fine.  How would federal funds rate, and you moved up the federal funds rate so interest rate on excess reserves, which is generating income for the is, we're not sure how effective it a little bit of insurance, on account the RRPs, that you're moving up both unsecured and secured rates.  This is a conversation many times at this table-about how comfortable you are regarding large spreads MR. POTTER.  Can I add two things?  Because Jim is always saying this to me-that this is what you feel if you just moved up the that there's still quite a big wedge, but you got it just inside the target range?  So you've got this big gap there between the banks, and federal funds.  That's one aspect.  The other one will be on other money market rates.  The normalization principles do start out with that concern with moving up other money market rates.  So there you get of we've had between those unsecured and secured rates.

to use the federal funds rate, instead of short-term that debate.  Again, I would have preferred the rate.  The consequence of that action would seem to be that we take no more action even if than the federal funds rate-that was the agreement we made around this that.  But as long as we have the same operating rules that we set as though our target has been that we just have to get the federal funds rate else moves relative to it, that is fine-we've done what we said we were Alternatively, we could go back and say we want to move short-term rates and not MR. ROSENGREN.  But we chose rates generally, when we did this.  So we did have general level of short-term rates, but that position lost around the table, and we chose the federal funds nothing moves other table.  Now, we could revisit out initially, it seems in that range.  If nothing going to do.

is held in the term facility.  Add to that made somewhere, which is that the holders are very anxious to be able to the term facility if they could get that.  Now you've got a facility in which you've receiving the daily rate that we want to hold things more stable, that's paying, and a large penalty associated with going between the two facilities. MR. FISCHER.  Thanks, Madam Chair.  Jim, I'm trying to figure out something on the possibility of paying interest on a daily basis on whatever a statement Simon break out of got people that's got some of the funds.  So if there are movements in the daily rate, you may find them breaking unless you have plain-vanilla tormenting you with this very technical issue. pay interest every maintenance period based on the excess reserves as we calculate them reserve maintenance period.  We have a single rate that we apply against those excess an anticipated change in the IOER in to reserve concepts-required reserves and excess reserves.  So, to to a system in which we're paying more on daily balances-we actually extensive programming effort in the very near future to make this why I just obliquely referred to a feasibility study. MR. CLOUSE.  Right.  I think you're speaking of the Term Deposit Facility, with a potential for having a floating rate.  This is actually an issue associated with our excess reserve calculations, and we apologize for We over the reserves, and that has these funny issues arise when there is the middle of the maintenance period.  We're stuck with that because, historically, interest on reserves had always been tied pull this off-to switch have to kick off a rather happen.  That's one of the reasons

putting forward is only really going to work, probably, for two or It works best when the interest rate on required and excess reserves are the same.  If The proposal that we're three years.

January 27-28, 2015

interest rate on required and the interest rate on excess, then there are a number of other complications that we would have to deal with.  But I think it may be a useful thing to bit better place.  So we're looking at that hard. the Committee were to get to a point at which you wanted to, again, make a distinction between the tortuous do for two or three years until we get to a

Was the question whether, if you're in a TDF and the interest on excess Was that I think it's going to float over the IOER rate, so there wouldn't be an incentive, MR. POTTER. reserve rates goes up, you would want to break it and get into a deposit with the Fed? your question? right?

Well, there might be an incentive-that the breakage fee, of course, on rich. MR. CLOUSE. the term deposit is quite

The point I wanted to make is that, if you give them the right to-let's just a repo with an option.  The bottom line are thousands of programs in which you get paid daily interest, and what you describe MR. FISCHER. say at no charge-get out of the term repo, then it's was, there is a major programming effort.  I'm surprised that that's a major programming effort.

There are many surprising things about our reserve calculations. is that we collect huge amounts of data from thousands of depository MR. CLOUSE. [Laughter]  The issue institutions.  There are hundreds of thousands of lines of code in this program, and it's never as easy as you think it should be.  But, having said all of that, we think we can accomplish it.

The other thing is, you can't get rid of the anticipatory effects.  In any expecting rates to go up, you're going to get those things happening in MR. FISCHER. case, if people start whatever system you've got.

That's right, but I think this would help because, on each day under this considering the rate MR. CLOUSE. scheme, a bank, if it wants to hold an extra dollar of reserves, wouldn't be

January 27-28, 2015

the average rate over the period.  It would be concept when you're controlling the federal funds rate on a daily basis.  So that's work to do before we can that would be in effect at the end of the period or considering the IOER rate that had been set for that day, and that seems like the right that you want to have the direction in which the staff is leaning right now, but we have some pull that off.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Brainard.

minimum over the time MS. BRAINARD.  I had a quick question of clarification on this.  I think you mentioned in passing that, in 2008, you solved the reverse problem by just doing the period.  Why did you choose to go to the end of the period as one of your options here, rather than just doing the maximum?

the same thing.  I thought the end of the maintenance to specify it as the maximum or the just the one at the end.  But the idea there is that, during normalization, most of for any of these cases in which the FOMC meeting was in But then, after the FOMC meeting happened, we'd have the full power rate-change supporting the level of the federal funds rate.  That was one of the is sort of the symmetric treatment of the way we handled option actually may be a bit better. MR. CLOUSE.  Well, in effect, it's period, actually, was a clever idea.  Then you don't have minimum-it's the rate changes would be increases, so the pressure you would see would be primarily in the first week of the maintenance period the middle of the period. of the IOER things we discussed in the memo, and it things in 2008.  But I think this third

CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman.

DUDLEY.  Jim, is the staff's preference now the third option? at the moment.  We have to do some more VICE CHAIRMAN MR. CLOUSE.  That's where we're leaning analysis.

January 27-28, 2015

When I read the memo, it sounded as though you were interest rate paid at the end of the reserve maintenance period.  That has the problem it's going to cause pressure on expectations that could create a lot of noise, especially as VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. favoring the that you're going into liftoff, and it seems as though that's not such an attractive option.  But you haven't posed in the questions what kind of feedback you want from us on this?

At this stage, we would intend to do some more spade work ourselves a memo or perhaps at a future meeting.  We was going to be a heavy lift to do the reprogramming.  We had thought about this for we've done some more pushing, and we think we could actually get it done by June MR. CLOUSE. and then report back to you, either in the form of knew there a while, but if everything goes right.

Okay.  My own personal preference is, I don't like the I think it's going to just create noise.  We're things to try to prevent noise.  So it seems to me as though this is another area VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. end of the reserve maintenance period, because doing all of these in which you want to try to reduce the level of noise.

When I read the memo, that was the logical way to do it, and I you guys have dug in and have found that a point out that, in the period from 2004 to 2006, when we were raising was a different world-we had a series of meetings at which it was going to raise rates a quarter point at the next I would just rates-and I know this almost certain, just a lock in markets, that we were

That's in the spirit of our recommendations for the maximum or the endMR. CLOUSE. of-period options.

market expectations because of the ability to arbitrage within the maintenance period. MR. LACKER.  Right.  You'd get the same pressure ahead of time, but now it's just part of

One of the things that started to give us pause, though, was the a bit more than 25 basis pointsinto that maintenance period, you could meeting. MR. CLOUSE. possibility that the Committee might choose to raise rates 50 basis points or 75 basis points.  Then, when you roll really see quite substantive pressures on the funds rate in advance of that

But you'd be seeing pressure all along the curve at any rate. MR. LACKER.

One difference is, we had a point target, and there was some variation in as though we're going to have a range.  That's what the say. MR. POTTER. that point target.  Right now, it looks normalization principles

MR. LACKER.  Yes, I know.  But this is about IOER, right?

same way about it? MR. LACKER.  You don't think we'd think the know how you'd feel if it was trading at 35 basis points.  Would MR. POTTER.  I don't you be okay if was trading at 35?

Well, yes-if it's for the same reasons and of the same magnitude as we It makes perfect sense. MR. LACKER. got in 2005.

And the Committee has told us that you're going to raise rates-that's MR. POTTER. why we're not doing it?

it's the first half of the maintenance period, before an FOMC meeting IOER by 25 basis points, and the funds rate or 10 basis points above range, personally, for me, I'll pledge to forgive you.  [Laughter] MR. LACKER.  If at which we're widely expected to increase the trades 5 MR. POTTER.  All right.

Just as I did in 2005. MR. LACKER.

Just because Committee is actually going to do it.

We faced the same problem in 2005-it was fine. MR. LACKER.

We did.  But we're saying it could be larger this time. MR. POTTER.

January 27-28, 2015

So then you define your tolerance levels.  I'll come back to this, Madam MR. FISHER. Chair, in my comments.

Okay.  Any further comments?  President Kocherlakota. CHAIR YELLEN.

Thanks, Madam Chair.  This is an idea I have not thought it with that caveat.  As I listened to some of the comments that as I heard you express your own desire, Madam Chair, to have, quite interest rate control, especially at the time of liftoff, I following possibility:  The timing of the decision by the Committee may not be the same as the timing of the first move in interest rates.

The answer to those questions is that we don't want to rate increase.  Anyway, if that's the think that can be talked through.

I'm not as concerned about the financial discussions. MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I prefer option 1 in the approaches.  I agree with you, Madam Chair, that when the time comes to raise rates, it's important that we maintain as much monetary control as The test market rates.  The temporary increase in the market participants some headroom.  I also support continued testing, as the Desk has proposed.

think we should be confident that market rates target range for the funds rate.  That's my reading of the wide evidence we've the Desk operations and everything we've done so far.  I think we should stick with MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I increasing the IOER is going to result in a sufficiently smooth rise in short-term when we raise the gotten from

January 27-28, 2015

the possibility that there's relationship between IOER and market rates than we've seen at any our plan to use the overnight RRP program as insurance only against more slack, perhaps, in the time over the past six years.

IOER, so I support the staff's the size suggested in option 1.  I wouldn't be against $1 trillion, just to be sure.  With such a large cap and a 25 basis point spread, I be in that corridor.  I think we should just make temporarily as large as it needs to be for us to be comfortable that we're going to be in problems. Using it as a backstop means a relatively wide spread to proposed spread of 25 basis points.  It's wider than anything we've tested so far and, apart from quarter-ends, take-up has not exceeded $300 billion.  With a 25 basis point spread, I'd expect significantly smaller take-up.  But in any event, I'd be comfortable with a large cap at a 25 basis point spread.  So, $600 billion is $800 billion or think we could be very confident that rates will the cap that corridor.  I think that's the way to solve our measures over quarter-end, back when we were in the old regime, to try to that, but everyone recognized that markets realized that of the forecast error of the funds rate-was going to be exceptionally large over and recognized that it didn't pose a fundamental problem for monetary policy case now, even though quarter-end comes a one potential prominent liftoff date. We're going to have volatility.  We could well have volatility on quarter-ends.  We always have had volatility on quarter-ends, and there probably always will.  The Desk has historically taken anticipate the shift in demand for reserves and to counteract that was a much more uncertain endeavor than off quarter-ends.  So volatility-sort quarter-ends effectiveness.  And I think that's going to be the week after

the path for the policy rate we take over time is going to be more On the strictly macroeconomic side of thinking about liftoff, I agree with others who made the argument that

January 27-28, 2015

at which start raising rates.  For interest rate volatility, I think the that interest rates display over the course of the month after liftoff is going to be much day of June, if that's when we choose to lift liftoff should concern you. important than a particular date behavior more consequential than what happens on the last off.  So I don't think one day's movement a couple of days after our said, it is clear we can implement monetary policy term RRP program.  I think a term program might be tricky to introduce before a liftoff signaling.  I think that's a delicate problem, but I suppose don't think the alternative of making the is attractive because it would further encourage machinery, overnight and term, is more of a permanent And as I said earlier, we face this I think simplicity is a virtue, and, as I without a meeting without tipping our hand or we could probably figure out a way to do that.  I program available now on a continuous basis markets to believe that our whole RRP feature of the financial landscape than I think we're intending. tension between expectations getting out of control and wanting to learn some things, and I think we've learned what we need to learn.

that the pressure on rates going into quarter-end is related to the enough cap, that concern should be minimal, and we're not likely to get any of the term RRP; the staff recognized made-why not use the tool in case, kind of a belt-and-suspenders approach-I think we see and have seen that our sustained basis builds a constituency.  Building a makes it difficult or costly for us to contemplate pulling back, and I seen that in the primary dealer survey data that I talked about. It's pretty clear probability that the overnight facility caps out at quarter-end and rates get driven down.  With a large downward pressure leading into quarter-end that motivated the this before we did the tests over the year-end.  So in the arguments just rolling out of facilities like this on a constituency for a program think we've

January 27-28, 2015

testing of term RRPs now.  I it seems warranted, in that extra capability in reserve.  Thank you, So I would favor option 1, and I'd be opposed to any further think we know enough about how they work.  I think rolling them out, if the weeks after we raise rates is the way to keep Madam Chair.

If we are using the reverse repo facility the floor price, we need to be flexible on the quantity of reverse repos.  Hence, setting the the forceful use of our tools at the time of liftoff.  It is likely that the more to quickly the factors that influence the spread between the IOER and the MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

range of 25 to 50 basis points at liftoff, I would set the IOER at a level where the 25 basis point floor with our usual reverse repo cap. the overnight reverse estimates prove wrong.  We have a lot to learn about correction of the IOER, if needed, to maintain the federal funds rate within the range without needing to rely so heavily on overnight reverse repos. To avoid disruption to financial markets, we should announce our intention to use the reverse repo facility as a temporary measure to ensure a smooth liftoff.  Assuming that we announce a target we can expect to achieve at least However, I would announce no reverse repo cap at first in order to allow repo to enforce the floor, should our managing the federal funds rate using a method that we have not used before.  We could then make a technical 25 to 50 basis point

requiring less use of reverse repos. Removing the reverse repo cap during the time of liftoff would convincingly convey our commitment to raise rates, possibly financial-stability concerns about the reverse repo facility have been raised.  The that use of the facility could alter the structure of the money markets.  Announcing the program should lower this risk.  By keeping the window short when we should be clear through our actions stability concern is the times of severe stress.  However, if there is a significant results in a substantial flight of funds to the reverse repo program, the response would be to postpone liftoff until the effects of the negative shock were Two first is temporary nature of the lift off and making appropriate adjustments without delay, it that our thinking on permanence has not changed.  The other financial possible flight to the facility during negative shock that appropriate better understood.

repo facility would time of liftoff.  In terms of that question, if the Committee is willing to have no reverse repo cap at liftoff, term be necessary.  The lower the cap, the more we need to use term repos. Allowing for a significant temporary increase in the overnight reverse be advisable.  I would go one step further and announce no path at the part b of reverse repos would not

I do not see a financial-stability preference for term reverse repos over They will also be more expensive than overnight reverse repos.  The memos supplemented with term reverse repos will result in a lower risk of stability than a program with only overnight reverse repos.  I'd like to understand this better.  Finally, the strategy of using term reverse repos prior to liftoff as a way of I would note that overnight reverse repos.  Term reverse repos would also likely be transacted primarily with money market funds.  They do expand our footprint, and they lock us into longer periods than may be advisable. seem to imply that caps financial argument

an unusual strategy, because the higher rate smoothing the withdrawal of reserves seems like announced on term reverse repos would, in effect, be the action of lifting off.

part of the question, if the Committee is willing to proceed without a cap at not much advantage to making other adjustments.  In contrast, if we are repo at liftoff, we will need to make flexible use of term reverse repos. financial-stability concerns significantly reduced by maturity of reverse repos, and because they are more costly, using term reverse reverse repos seems suboptimal.  I do not In terms of c the outset, then there is going to cap the reverse However, because I do not find the lengthening the repos to enable arbitrarily limiting the cap on overnight see much benefit in narrowing the IOER-reverse repo spread or using term deposits, at least until we have obtained a better sense of the effectiveness of our initial move to liftoff.

There has not been much discussion of how international flows would affect our liftoff.  With bank reserves in many countries receiving a announcing an increase foreign capital.  Better understanding that dynamic would be useful.  Thank you, Madam

This would address both the need for reverse repo programs potential methods of phasing out the liftoff has been accomplished with a difficult to argue that continuing with a large program is not required for exactly the reasons we are considering a larger smaller program.

We might decide we prefer heavier use of term an even larger overnight facility.

Too many policy tools that operate along too many different I also agree with the Chair that we should keep things as simple as possible.  In particular, operating with two instruments, the IOER and the ON RRP, should be normalization.

to help smooth me to draw attention to it rather than just making the cap on overnight RRPs large in the first instance.  This type of year-end or quarter-end is self-induced by reporting practices and the efforts of firms to report balance sheets representative of their average positions.  I see no reason for us to care or to if they are on macroeconomic performance or just too transitory.  It would serve us well at the outset to be having market participants expect us to intervene once we set up separate term RRPs just for the quarter-end-once we infrequent or occasional volatility that leads the rate to trade above or below our target range. While I could imagine a term RRP facility that would primarily serve window-dressing-induced funds volatility at the end of quarters, I'm dubious of this benefit and would be inclined to oppose it.  In other words, doing something separate at the end of quarters seems to enough to accommodate at least volatility that may not truly be be complicit in subsidizing this behavior.  Let the firms pay the price for this practice inclined to do so.  It is unlikely to have any material effect our goals and objectives.

When and how this mismatch will be resolved remains an open question reconciliation could involve substantial market volatility and the normalization cycle other than the liftoff date itself. Indeed, financial market volatility is of a intentions. during the summer of 2013.

For this reason, I lean toward a larger program and benefits that that may bring with respect to our normalization policy.

The testing experience of the overnight RRP and our communication of policy normalization principles and plans confidence that the overnight RRP, on a temporary basis, can be an effective way at liftoff, if needed, I would also support the use of term RRPs after liftoff to ensure the funds rate trades our adjustments that were outlined in the memo, I support rate, along with a sufficiently large well as using term deposits.

difficulty in saying, you know, it's $400, $600, $800, $1 trillion.  What are the costs financial stability and the benefits there?  I think it's really impossible to judge ex stability, footprint issues, analysis that's been done so far suggests that what is is that we have sufficient headroom for this to be effective, and in my own view prudent to set a cap that's significantly high.  I thought the $600 billion would be already pretty high, but clearly people have suggested even higher might And one issue, of course, is the size of the cap on the repo facility, and I, like many of the others, have in terms of ante the optimal size of the facility and the tradeoffs between financial and effectiveness.  Now, I do think that the really important it would be viewed by this group as be optimal.

kind of a nuanced point.  I don't see this as raising the cap-and actually gets back to President Lacker's point earlier.  When we did the testing of policy decision of how big the overnight $300 billion to $600 billion. would prefer not to We're setting the cap at the that is the most appropriate to achieve monetary control, and, of course, as time goes on more, we can reduce the cap as appropriate.  And, again, I don't see the risk to or regarding footprint issues to be that significant.  This is a temporary and phase it out as appropriate. And I'm going to make this $300 billion, that was clearly stated not to be our reverse repo facility was going to be.  This is not raising it from This is just setting what it will be initially, whatever that number is.  So I communicate this as saying that we're raising this in some way. level and we learn financial stability program.  We've indicated that, and we will reduce it monetary I'm confident that, under option 1, we have the necessary tools to maintain control during the normalization period.  I really think that this is an appropriate option when

simple, and I think it follows the plans and principles viewed in terms of our basic strategy.  It's we laid out.

we discussed, I would only see adjusting the spread of the IOER and the overnight necessary, if the other tools that we On the other issues, in terms of spreads, I agree, like others, that with a wide spread initially, as reverse repo rates as something you would only do if it was were using weren't working.  I see the TDF as always a backup facility-again, there to support if needed.

the term reverse repo facility, I am in favor of continuing the test for I think that there is an open question about the value of further testing of a daily or a talking about belts it were going to use, and something to think about, any problems with the testing around the quarter-end because I think that, to the term reverse repo, just creates some additional communication challenges for us.  I think IOER is the support, and then we tools behind.  It is already pretty complicated.  We don't want to make it too In terms of testing March. regular term reverse repo facility as, again, another backstop.  So we're now and suspenders, more belts, more suspenders.  I do think if you were to test it too extensively, would lead people to think this is something we although I don't see me, would be limited.  I do think I'm not opposed to the further testing of but again, I think it is our first line of defense.  Overnight reverse repo with a sizable cap have these other complicated.  Thank you.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota. CHAIR

Chair.  I'm happy to go along with the staff.  It sounded to me like the of option 1, with possibly even a higher cap, if needed.  I'm MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam consensus of the room on the questions being posed by the consensus is building in support comfortable going along with that.

January 27-28, 2015

as being ones me.  I thought President Rosengren's question about had not thought about and would be useful for the I thought President Mester's comment about emphasizing the critical.  President Williams is right to highlight to be temporary.  On the I said in September in an ongoing fashion, if we go larger, because there might be a temptation to think that's going to mean as well.  I think we just have to be clear in our communications, on an be a temporary facility. I wanted to highlight some of the comments that I heard around the table that I felt particularly resonated with international cash flows is one that I Committee to explore further. temporary nature of what we're doing is really that we've already made reference to the fact that we intend this facility other hand, that September 2014 communication replaced a June 2011 communication.  So think it would be useful for us to cement what we especially we're going to go longer ongoing basis, that we intend this to heard along those lines is President Bullard's comment about timing:  is going to be special in some of the considerations we heard?  Are we not always we've got to get the interest rate in the range?  And that led A tension I liftoff really going to be concerned about, well, me to be very sympathetic to President Lockhart's question or suggestion that we explore and communicate clearly what we have in mind about an exit plan from this facility.  I think that would help bring clarity to our commitment to having this be a temporary facility.

as I said, I'm willing to be supportive of whatever consensus emerges from our I'll close with, Madam Chair, is that in my own thinking, this in later goevolution of the data in the past six months means we should be discussing how to credibility of our inflation target.  We've heard a lot of conversations about of that Overall, discussion.  I guess the one point conversation is premature.  The time is simply not right for liftoff.  As I'll explain rounds, the solidify the credibility already today.  I'll be talking about credibility as well, about the credibility

January 27-28, 2015

means providing more accommodation, not less.  So our topic, I think, to ease financial market conditions and bolster and less about how we plan to tighten in the near term. 2 percent goal, and that should be turning more to how we can use tools the credibility of that inflation target Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Fisher. CHAIR

we will tighten at one point and we will have liftoff to make a few comments here.  Obviously, we all want to this before.  I think the we're feeling our way.  For me, provided that yields on maturities of a few weeks and longer respond appropriately, some initial at liftoff would be don't think they have a real economy.  It's important, of course, that we do, however, have the Committee, I'd want to see some decision tree analysis, and some definition of our tolerance would make sense to me. MR. FISHER.  Well, assuming that at some point, Madam Chair, I want maximize the odds that liftoff will be smooth.  Governor Brainard underscored the precious nature of the current circumstance.  Simon pointed out we haven't done markets understand, to a degree, that securities that have temporary departure of overnight rates from the intended target range inconsequential.  I think President Lacker has made that point.  I agree.  I material effect on the fallback plans.  One thing I didn't see in the papers-I may not have read them thoroughlywere I the New York Desk and explaining this to alternative scenario planning, some limits.  That respectful suggestion.  I think that's the way I would approach it.  We have, as maintain control of monetary policy during normalization.  That promise was made take lightly actions that might lead the public and financial intention to honor it.  I believe under the previous Chairman I actually So it's a many have pointed out, promised that the ON RRP would be temporary and used only as necessary to for good reasons.  We shouldn't institutions to doubt our

[Laughter]  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I won't tell you what she that's a separate thing.

some skepticism in the marketplace about the temporary nature of this mention this.  We can throw out numbers like $1 trillion or However, I think we have to be very careful about whatever number we choose numbers.  My second point is-I think an excellent suggestion-I don't know how we do it, but we should at exit strategy should be for using the program. I do think there is facility, and here's why I $600 billion. and not be indiscriminate with a large number because it might undermine the confidence that this is a temporary facility and, again, indicate that we're not so chaste in the use of this facility. I would be very, very careful about throwing out President Lockhart makes least have in our own mind what the maybe $600 billion but no it's critical to maintain the floor.  And I'd be very careful in in any way that would undermine the confidence of the markets that this is a temporary In summary, I would prefer to start with an ON RRP program, larger.  I'd supplement with term RRPs at quarter-ends, perhaps term deposits, and only move to a more aggressive use of RRPs if using it facility.

have established a precedent of engaging in times when there is predictable temporary increase in demand for safe If liftoff occurs near the quarter-end, as seems likely, it would be perfectly If the With regard to term RRPs, I understand from our discussion today that there are pros and cons, but they could be close substitutes, and we term RRP operations at short-term assets. natural for us to auction term RRPs coincident with liftoff and spanning the quarter-end.

January 27-28, 2015

have a chance to see how overnight rates response, whether the operations are too small, additional RRPs need to be auctioned, or term maturity dates on term RRPs are staggered, we'll respond as the term RRPs roll off, and we can decide, depending on that current cap on ON RRP deposits should be offered at a premium over the IOER rate.

a 5 basis point the ON RRP rate relative to the lower end of the target range for the federal funds I was discussing this with Governor Brainard.  I understand that might be a short-term I feel pretty strongly that we should maintain the 25 basis point spread between ON we go through time, I would suggest perhaps use that spread as a way to limit demand for RRP.  So I can see widening it.  I don't the idea of temporarily shortening it, because I think it may undermine our commitment to over time.  I may be wrong. One of the things that caught my eye in the memo was a suggestion of increase in rate. tactic, but RRP and the IOER rates-and we should be careful that, as we like widening it mentioned that I think it would be a at quarter-end.  There was a number of $200 billion somewhere.  Why not do $300 $100 billion on hand in case we need to have it? And then last, with regard to term RRPs, again, I useful tool billion?  In other words, why not keep an extra

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman Dudley. CHAIR

Chair.  For me, just like everybody my top priority.  That's more important than the size of the concerns.  First of all, over a very short period of time, liftoff will either be won or lost, the financial-stability risks VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam else, having a smooth liftoff is facility or the potential financial stability when our credibility with respect to

January 27-28, 2015

pretty small.  Also, I think we can address the issue of footprint by making it clear that this will be used only to the extent needed to maintain monetary policy will be phased out.  It's temporary, not permanent. are overnight RRP facility control, and when it's not needed, it a lot of ways to generate sufficient headroom.  You can have a overnight RRP facility or you can have a somewhat smaller overnight RRP facility then I think the facilities are likely to be effective in putting a floor under short-term think we that we've done.  I mean, the tests do seem to suggest in terms of putting a floor under short-term rates. With respect to the options in the memo, I think it's essential that we have sufficient headroom, and I think there's very large supplemented by term RRP.  As long as there's sufficient headroom and this expectation is realized, rates.  We have been talking about a lot of details over the past couple of hours, but I should get some confidence from the tests that these facilities actually do work

with option 1 and have a high cap initially on the overnight RRP facility or no cap at to signal that cap down in order to reinforce the message that this In terms of the split between overnight RRP and term RRP, I think the simplest solution is just to go all.  The advantage of having a high cap, a cap that they are not going to reach, is this is not unlimited, and it allows you then to move the cap down as you see that you have a lot of extra headroom.  You can then move that thing is going to go away over time.

is I testing program for term and the September quarter.  So if you lifted off in June or you have to announce the term RRPs.  They are to into the actual term RRPs.  In looking at the increase If you decided that you wanted to have term RRPs, I think the way I would do it would have term RRPs that just address quarter-end, and I would have a RRPs in place for the June quarter lifted off in September, you wouldn't even really be tested.  The tested RRPs would just turn in demand over quarter-end, what you see is about a $200 billion increase in demand over

January 27-28, 2015

that if you had a term RRP program of $200 billion, you that tested in June, September, et cetera.  You could just roll right into it if you off in the quarter, and if you didn't lift off in the quarter, you're just it out after the fact, inserting more noise into the market that you're going to have to communicate about. quarter-end.  So that would suggest could have actually happened to lift doing another test.  That, to me, has the advantage of it all being announced ex ante.  There's no surprises to the market in terms of what you're going to do.  If you roll you're just other steps to ensure a smooth liftoff, I think that we all agree that good think what I would hope that we could do is reach a consensus in is all going to work and then have the Chair communicate that to the in speeches or the minutes.  I think there is broad enough think we could get to something in March where we could sort of tell the In terms of communication is important.  I March about how this markets or communicate that consensus here that I markets what we're doing prior to liftoff.

actually sense of the Committee is that we're not going to do term RRP away of ask myself the question, why are we testing it?  I think we just don't think we should test things that we're not going to do because I influence their expectations.  Thank you, Madam Regarding term RRP testing away from quarter-end, I'm fine with it if we're going to do it.  But if the from quarter-end, then I sort have to ask ourselves.  I think that just confuses markets and starts to Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer. CHAIR

think it's totally agreed that we have to do retain our credibility as people who can control the interest rate, which we'd say it MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I this successfully to better be able to do.  And almost everything I have to say has been said already, so I'll quickly.

January 27-28, 2015

Vice Chairman we should have a term RRP in place when we plan on doing this. Overnight RRP at somewhere around $600 billion seems right.  I like Dudley's statement that term RRPs and not is that you can make the overnight facility smaller as a signal of not wanting to have a big footprint.  I had thought, listening to Federal Open Market Committee meetings, that it was a big is because I don't know whether this is just reacting to words, but I'm not sure we should be firms to window-dress by making it cheaper for them to window-dress, and that's The tradeoff between having the RRP discussion in three or four previous factor in everyone's mind, but it seems to have shrunk a little bit now, and the $600 billion probably more convenient in the hope that you might not need the term RRP.  The reason I say that is encouraging what the term RRP does.

ON RRP, and I think we think we can describe the scenarios under which we are going to exit. the balance sheet down to $1 trillion, at which point I start possibly becoming able to see an end to this program, unless there is something Lacker's position-namely, that we could do it all by IOER.  And says:  that's not true at $4 trillion, but it is true at $3Â½ trillion.  If exit.  But I very much doubt that we can do that.  We need to think list.  It would be nice if it was list of priorities, but I don't think it will be. I'm interested in when we are going to become independent of the we're very optimistic if It is going to take a while until we get guess we'll we're missing about President maybe there is something that so, then we can stage an early about how we're going to exit, but that shouldn't be high on our high on our things know what it is that we're going to do.  There are millions of American citizens who learned about open market operations in their The last point, again, is just to support the need for explaining what we're going to dopreparing answers to frequently asked questions, et cetera-so that even people who are not engaged in buying and selling these probably tens of

January 27-28, 2015

this is about.  Why don't think we have to worry about explaining ourselves economics textbooks and have trouble figuring out what on earth all you just do it in a good, old-fashioned way?  I even more than usual.  Thank you.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo. CHAIR

to me today's discussion was a reaffirmation of this point-that the between just ON RRP and a mix of ON RRP and term RRP is relative to my source of concerns.  And I think President Lockhart and have put their finger on the source of my concerns, which is, as President an exit plan for a reason I'll explain in a minute. MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I began this exercise, whenever we started talking about it months ago, with a strong set of financial stability concerns, which, unlike many of you, have not abated during the course of these discussions.  But it has become apparent over time-and I think part of financial-stability difference probably not that great President Kocherlakota Lockhart put it, an exit plan.  And I guess I disagree with Governor Fischer.  I think we'd better think about things could go here.  One, with a large-ish ON RRP, we begin things go pretty smoothly, and the take-up there is a cap-that we've put in place.  And as President Plosser the next meeting we can reduce the cap without any concerns about what happens. There are two ways that liftoff at some point in the future, and it turns out that is nowhere near the cap-if suggested, at A powerful message will be sent to the money market fund industry and, indeed, to everybody else.

is substantial take-up.  And in there is still concern that-as Narayana was suggesting-in the absence of or at least in having confidence that we'll be within the target range.  It seems to me The other scenario is one in which it turns out that there subsequent meetings, the continued use of a very large ON RRP, there may be some difficulty in getting within the target range,

January 27-28, 2015

is the scenario to worry about.  I don't know what the probabilities are regarding that don't know that anybody could say with any great assurance even the order of probabilities are, but I think they're nontrivial. that this scenario.  I magnitude for what the where the question of, as Dennis put it, the exit plan comes into play, because we confront is a variant of a time-consistency problem:  That is, at any given facility, and any financial stability issue is speculative.  It's not around right tomorrow's Committee, not even the members who are on why, in general, policymakers pay more attention to problems often don't get addressed-because of the we all face.  So I think, under those circumstances, there are two ways to second is And here is I think what meeting, it always seems like the best thing is to make sure you hit the range with confidence with a big ON RRP now, of course, and is probably for the Committee right now.  This is precisely short-term issues and why long-term decision pressures that deal with those longer-range contingencies.  One, which I'm going to come back to in a second, is some variant on a commitment device-that is, sort of an ex ante approach.  The having more options as you go forward, a kind of ex post approach.

might be a good idea to continue to investigate, through testing and otherwise, other with them.  So my instinct would be to let the Several people have already stated why, notwithstanding their preference for option 1, they think it tools that may be available, and I would agree Desk test anything it thinks might be useful at some point to give us as an option.

way-that is, the commitment device-the only thing I have have heard it from almost everybody who has spoken to this point, 'Well, we said temporary.'  Well, you know, this is what a time-consistency problem is defined by.  You when you come to the point of turns out that that gets trumped by the shorter-term considerations, and With respect to the first heard, and I it's have a stated policy, which of course is the preference.  But making the decision, it

January 27-28, 2015

that that's the circumstance you're in.  So is temporary, I don't think, in and of itself, can be hugely reassuring, even it is better to say it and to say it repeatedly than not that at some point other actors begin to figure out stating that something though it helps, and there is no question that to say it.

kinds of commitment devices should at least be thought about: there is some way to tie the maximum size of an ON RRP over time, even change for quite some time, so that at least there would be a are, and I think Governor Fischer is right And I heard many people say, 'As appropriate, down.'  Well, what if that decision It then becomes hard to bring it down. But I do think that other for example, whether to the balance sheet, which may not clear ending point.  I don't know what other ideas there in suggesting it's going to be hard to come up with them.  But I'm left quite uncomfortable just relying on our saying, 'Well, it's temporary.' we would bring it down,' or 'As possible, we would bring it still seems a hard one?

is that, of course, it puts a constraint on the definition of a commitment device.  But you've got to do it.  If you don't to me that we're not saying we are still placing some The problem with a commitment device discretion.  That's do it, and you're not willing to do it ex ante to some degree, then it suggests putting any value on financial stability considerations, which I think is different from put dominant value on the precision of the monetary policy execution but value on financial stability considerations.

easier to make that decision.  They allowed this industry to get started, and There was a major run circumstance in which everybody ran to the Fed, 'We'd better increase the ON RRP.  Otherwise, As I say, I can't value it, but it does seem to me that we don't want to have our children or somebody looking back at some point and saying, 'You know, the Fed just slipped into this. At every point, it was then what happened? and their successors were sitting there saying,

January 27-28, 2015

financial instability.''  So that's why, whether you call it a decision tree as President exit plan, or just gaming it through-I think which was we can get beyond mere words with something ex ante, then allow a bunch of stuff that may help us develop some ex post options as Thank you, Madam Chair. there's Fisher suggests, or President Lockhart's what Narayana was suggesting-I do hope that we can think more about this between now and March and see whether Simon and Lorie to test needed later on.

YELLEN.  Thank you. CHAIR

were said that would actually deal with this very issue.  I think the points are excellent.  But I view adjusting the IOER to be above the range as exactly the kind we could use so that we didn't have to rely on the overnight reverse repo so much. I meant when I said we have these other backstop raising the overnight IOER, and things like that. term reverse repo also is like that.  That's what I meant when I said we should keep reserve so that if we find that to hit our range or, say, to keep the federal funds rate in the $1 trillion overnight reverse repo and we don't want to keep it there, we other tools to avoid that.  I think that, actually, I agree with the points you're making, that's what I and maybe others mean when we said, 'Well, you should use MR. WILLIAMS.  I had a two-hander.  I actually feel that you left out of your comments many of the things that you made of tool that Let me go through that scenario.  That's what policies-like TDF, changing the spread, or And I think these in range, we need to have a can use the but I do think that these other steps as backup.'

WILLIAMS.  That's what I meant.

MR. TARULLO.  I hope that's right, John.

MR.

into I also heard you say that it was MR. TARULLO.  I hope that's right, and I think the things you suggested would fall the category of ex post other options, which I identified.  But

January 27-28, 2015

heard a number of other people talk about the virtue of basis a different thought through a bit beforehand, and it's lay of the land, and maybe you a soft commitment device.  But that's really what I'm calling for, not just relying on already pretty complicated, and I've simplicity in execution.  So I don't discount the possibility that when, at some future meeting, rates are already-I can't even remember what our ranges are now.  You can't say 75 points anymore.  You have to think, 12Â½ less than, 12Â½ more-up somewhat and we have this discussion and people say, 'Oh, gee, it would make it complicated to try to introduce IOER spread or term RRPs.'  Again, if it's communicated, including to the public, you then begin to alter the are creating the fact that at some point in the future we'll think better of it.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman.

My conception is very similar to that of President in a way to achieve a better tradeoff.  I think in terms important.  And after tradeoffs at a different than you do in liftoff.  So I would distinguish liftoff, in terms of the need for simplicity at later, when I think you could have different tradeoffs. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Williams in terms of having these other tools.  And if you don't like the tradeoff that you find after liftoff, you can adjust these other tools of the simplicity/complexity argument, simplicity at liftoff is particularly liftoff, I think you can introduce more complexity if you want to set the place liftoff, from that way.  I mean, maybe we will, butMR. TARULLO.  I know everybody has done that, Vice Chairman Dudley, but I don't quite understand why that's so-why I should believe or why any of us should believe that we are really going to feel

DUDLEY.  If we truly don't like the tradeoffs, why wouldn't we to get to a better place? VICE CHAIRMAN pick some other parameters to adjust

January 27-28, 2015

What I was suggesting is the calculus of a tradeoff at any given will weigh heavily toward as precise an execution of one's monetary policy objectives norms, just as now I think they are being pushed-not them-but I think they are being downplayed now.  I think the and otherwise, takes effect at any given point along the way.  And is a very rational, logical reason why you should be right, which is to say that credibility would all be more comfortable with more softness.  But I the way everyone, or even the majority, of the Committee, or some future So that's why I think talking it through first and communicating upfront of one as I would like, but at least a soft commitment device-as opposed to just telling not getting beyond that. think there is any disagreement conceptually with what the options are.  I'm just thinking MR. TARULLO. moment as one can achieve.  And, thus, other obliterated, and nobody denies same dynamic, psychological there having been established initially, we don't know that that's Chair will feel about it. the way we're thinking about it does, as I say, serve as a form of soft commitment device-not as hard ourselves, if we don't like the tradeoff later, we can do it differently, but I don't in terms of institutional dynamics.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Fisher.

I made before, and I think Governor was endorsing it-that old quip, 'Trust in Allah, but tie your camel.'  I just want to make back pocket, we have done the studies.  And if it to work, we pull out these different tools, and that's what I call management.  That was one point I was trying to make.  I think you agreed, Dan. MR. FISHER.  I want to come back to a point Tarullo sure we have simplicity of liftoff, but that in our doesn't work the way we want it decision tree can do is sell assets, and we know how to sell the MR. POTTER.  That the main thing we Treasuries pretty easily.

January 27-28, 2015

I hope you develop these alternatives, and at least to the Committee some of the thinking.  I'm not sure we should explain it to the not saying that.  I mean, we do have to have something in our pocket, and we have MR. FISHER.  So, again, I won't be here, but explain public.  I'm to tie our camel.  That's the point I was making.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota.

Chair.  President Fisher is proving, with colorful metaphors, why he'll be missed so much.  [Laughter]  But in a serious vein, I think is a actions and the short-term public regarding what we it being temporary, not only in terms of that will MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam his Governor Tarullo has hit the nail on the head here-that at any given moment in time, there tendency to focus on the short-term needs and the short-term dynamics.  And I think it will be useful to provide underpinnings to the mean by 'temporary,' and why we feel comfortable with having a plan in our heads, but also having a plan that we communicate to the public make it clear that we know how we're going to be temporary about this.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Governor Powell.

interesting discussion.  I was tempted to two-hand MR. POWELL.  It has been a very myself there.  [Laughter]  I'm not sure if that's a legal move.

MR.

WILLIAMS. We'll take care of that.

in the short term and then come back to the that Governor Tarullo and others have discussed here.  I think we have, for term, established that we want the reverse repo facilities to be size as they can be, consistent with an appropriate degree of monetary policy.  I think with that established, we can, should, and must use our to achieve that level of control.  And based on what market participants are MR. POWELL.  Anyway, I'm going to start excellent questions the purposes of the short temporary in time and as limited in control over tools aggressively

January 27-28, 2015

the cap is unlikely to be range and rates will be close to the I think that's a great place to start. telling us and what the tests seem to show, if the market perceives that binding, then RRP will provide a good floor for our target middle of the range.

I'm somewhere around 'option 1Â½.'  By that I a while, at around $200 billion.  That's the way I would do So my prior is:  At liftoff, we should have not overwhelming force but overwhelming headroom.  And, looking at the options, I guess mean where I would be is, $400 billion or $500 billion overnight repo and term.  I would do term at quarter-end, every quarter-end for it.

another thing if they do that right after liftoff.  I think it's to allow, rates to go out of our range. another for people to see that the Federal Reserve doesn't have the tools or doesn't use its in the range.  So I think that it really is important to do what to have a pretty substantial degree of control at the beginning. I would say, in terms of the control point, it's one thing if rates plunge below the overnight rate in June 2017, and it's one thing if the Fed chooses to allow, and is seen to choose It's tools well enough to keep rates we're all suggesting, which is are concerned, I start with the idea that the IOER rate ought to be top of the range and the ON RRP rate ought to be at the bottom of the range.  I think same time is confusing.  I think my first tool off the bench, if we need it, would be to move the ON RRP rate up 5 basis points.  That seemed to do point for basis point.  So that could As far as the other tools at the moving them both around at the you will, if the trick.  That moved up the federal funds rate almost basis be a tool, but I would hold that in abeyance.  That does go to the point of using not so much the size.

think plan or at least further consideration of the conditions under Coming back to the medium-term and longer-term issues, these are great points.  I President Lockhart's idea of an exit

January 27-28, 2015

well worth exploring, and if there are other commitment technologies out to deal with the time-consistency problem. which we would exit is there, they would be worth exploring as well me we've learned a great deal in the testing, and testing has in a way as we hoped it would.  And the possibility of sending negative signals really segregated balance accounts.  That takes me to 'Let's not test something that we're probably not going to use, because if it, people are really going to expect us to use it.  So let's not do that.'  I would certainly testing term RRP over the March quarter-end.  I guess I wouldn't test off like to me we're going to use it.  On tool, but I guess the chances are that we may well use it.

YELLEN.  Well, I think we've had a great round of discussion, and we agreed that we would come back to the testing resolutions after we had this discussion.  What I'd that first thing in the morning.  The staff can give us some proposals discussion, and we would take it up, if that's acceptable, before we go morning. CHAIR earlier like to suggest is that we do for testing in light of the into policy discussions tomorrow for the limited testing that Simon talked about. MR. CLOUSE.  There was one outstanding question of whether you would like to see two proposals, one for just quarter-end testing or another one has already

Why don't we try to get a sense of that?  I mean, most people have that, and a variety of views were expressed.  In terms of the quarter-end testing, I heard was that most people were supportive of CHAIR YELLEN. addressed although there was a diversity of views, what

YELLEN.  No, just the testing at quarter-end, not outside quarter-end.  I'll take [Show of hands]  Okay.  And who would be opposed to the quarter-end testing? is appropriate.  Now let's take, I think, the more controversial piece, which would be two? CHAIR that separately. [Show of hands]  Okay.  Although we don't have unanimity, I think coming back to us with that proposal testing of term RRPs over the next month or

We could do some testing from late February to early March. YELLEN.  Right.  So making it a relatively small scale, not at quarter-end, and I be part of our liftoff toolkit.  In fact, I heard pretty at liftoff.  Nevertheless, I did hear a may want to reduce the cap over time on the overnight we might potentially want to use.  It's not clear we would use Governor Fischer. MR. POTTER.

YELLEN.  A small testing program that maybe would end at the beginning of many people would be interested in seeing a proposal along those lines?

I think my suggestion, seeing that, would be that maybe you come back tomorrow morning with two proposals.  People, of course, can sleep on it, and we're not forced to go ahead with both things, but I think I see enough support especially a small-scale test, that maybe we should see a proposal.

to suggest that the staff give some thought to this-and for, say, the next round on the horizon after that?  On the the next quarter-end, which could be the consequential one.  Now, a couple right through to liftoff, right?  So they want to have it in place and keep going.  Well, really testing.  I mean, no one spoke about how compelling these research memo were.  Basically, people were thinking about whether they want term RRP until we lift off.  So this should raise in our minds the question of, when a program?  When is it official that it's not a test?  We may want to that before June, when it's MR. LACKER.  Yes, I'd like maybe this is just terminology.  You know, the Desk brings us a proposal of testing, and I'm continually asking about, all right, what's horizon after that is of people around the table spoke of quarter-end term RRPs as something they want to initiate and just carry that suggests we're not questions in the to be in place from now is it not testing and when is it just hold in our minds that, all right, it's official, but we're going to call it testing until we lift off. I don't know, but I think it would be worthwhile for us to think about upon us, or April, when we have to think about June testing.

CHAIR YELLEN.  I think that's correct.

Chair, may I ask a question just to help answer this tomorrow? MR. FISHER.  Madam When you say 'a small amount,' what do we mean?

not we would get to that in any single operation, I'm not sure.  This is one on which we're not doing this over quarter-end, and you don't want to could have adverse consequences. MR. POTTER.

As before, our forecast of foreign growth strengthening to its about 3 percent rests on a number of China's economic growth declines only gradually in the next few years, from 7Â¼ percent in 2014 to 6Â¾ percent in 2017, and the country avoids sharp disruptions associated with the ongoing correction of its housing market.  Fourth-quarter GDP came in at 7 percent, a touch lower than our projection in December, and we down our outlook going forward by about Â¼ percentage point, in part reflecting the appreciation of the renminbi that has occurred as and other ailing economies in South America pull recessions and eventually regain near-trend rates of growth.

Second, the broad dollar is Returning unchanged from the December forecast (the dashed red line). revised down the projections for China and South America.  However, other developments have boosted the outlook and largely offset these downward revisions. First, as shown in panel Tealbook, and we estimate this should add about 0.1 percentage point foreign growth.  The boost would be bigger, except that lower oil prices mark down the outlook for Mexico and Canada, oil exporters that account for a large share of our up another 3 percent (panel 4), which adds another 0.1 percentage point to foreign economic growth.

cut to of economic was not already anticipated in our outlook, they would not necessarily that falling oil prices may told, these monetary easings are a plus for global economic growth. Finally, monetary policy is more accommodative than in the December Tealbook not only in the euro area, but also in Canada, where the policy rate was Â¾ percent, and in the United Kingdom, where we now see liftoff being delayed to the end of this year.  If these easing actions were in response to a weakening activity that boost our economic growth forecast.  But, especially in the euro area, monetary loosening appears to be importantly motivated by risks push down headline inflation (panel 5), so far as to unhinge inflation expectations. Much the same considerations led the BOJ to amp up its QQE program late last year. Thus, all some gloom about the a into our forecast for foreign economic the uncertainty attending estimates of these effects, As Simon has described, financial markets are evidencing global outlook, and there is certainly no shortage of downside risks.  Nevertheless, it is worth noting some risks on the upside as well.  For starters, we've built reasonably limited boost from falling oil prices growth, and taking into account

As shown in 3, our projection regarding oil prices, based on futures markets, turns back up This partly reflects expected increases in the demand for oil respond to lower oil prices.  In such as the United States.  But the extent to which U.S. oil production will investment projects are being scaled back, future extraction will be wells.  The Department of Energy is projecting production will still move up through the early part of the year.  We supply held up well enough to push oil prices would likely push U.S. and foreign that as oil prices fall to very low levels, most dependent on oil Additionally, the decline panel over the forecast period. as global economic growth picks up and users addition, lower oil prices are expected to damp oil production in higher-cost producers fall off in response to lower prices is quite uncertain.  Although rig counts are down and oil concentrated in the most productive that U.S. oil would not be greatly surprised if oil below levels called for by futures markets.  This growth up further, although it is possible some financial vulnerabilities-especially in EMEs revenues-might be exacerbated.

as expectations mounted for additional monetary as our monetary tightening boosts the dollar a bit further depreciates a touch summer, we have been regularly underpredicting dollar gets in the euro area or a hard landing in run-up could be reversed, as shown by in panel 1 of your next exhibit and as we discussed in the alternative the Risks and Uncertainty section of the Tealbook.  As well, oil prices, in rise more steeply than in our baseline forecast.  Panels 3 and 4 show the staff's judgmental projection.  The this scenario leads to a rise in GDP above its baseline path, to deliver a large but transitory run-up in inflation. Finally, I'd like to turn to the dollar, shown in panel 4.  Since your December meeting, the dollar has risen further easing abroad, mainly in the euro area.  Looking ahead, we expect the broad real dollar to move sideways against other industrial-country currencies, while the dollar against EME currencies.  Since last the rise in the dollar, and we could certainly be doing so again.  But as the higher, the chances that it could surprise us on the downside have also grown.  The dollar's current valuation partly reflects material probabilities of very adverse developments abroad, such as renewed crisis China.  If these downside risks do not materialize and confidence in the global outlook improves, much of the dollar's recent the red line scenarios in panel 2, might the effect of these developments in our general equilibrium model SIGMA, whose results may differ from those encompassed in decline of the dollar in which is only partially offset by the effect of the higher oil price, while these developments work together David will now continue our briefing.

First, the greater-than-expected strength in spending and the labor market during the second half of last year implies some greater in real activity coming into the first half of this year than we previously believed.

Second, the some restraint on spending and employment.  By the end of 2017, the stronger dollar relative level of real unemployment rate, all else in oil prices that Steve also mentioned provides, on all of the effects by our Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas colleague fuel sectors will take some sizable hits to employment Third, the further plunge balance, a countervailing boost to aggregate demand.  To be sure, not of the decline in oil prices on the U.S. economy will be positive.  In particular, we anticipate some considerable reductions in drilling and mining investment in the next few quarters.  As well, if oil prices stay low, oil production should level off this year and then edge lower, in contrast to the steep uptrend of the past few years.  And, as suggested by work, authored jointly Mine YÃ¼cel, states, large fossil relative to what they would have experienced otherwise.

Or, putting upward revision to the level of activity in the near forward through much of the projection period, yielding a slightly higher forecast than in the previous one.

Over the medium term, little revised, as the slightly tighter margin of slowly over period, reaching 1.6 percent next year and 1.8 percent in 2017. The last panel negative than before, mainly on account of the further plunge addition, as softer trajectory over the data, including our translation of the however, the inflation forecast is resource utilization in this projection has only a minimal effect on our inflation forecast.

Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer. CHAIR

MR. FISCHER.  Yes, thanks.  I'd like to ask both David Wilcox and Michael Kiley a question.  David, you showed us PCE, and I was wondering whether anything is happening to real wages in your forecast.

MR. FISCHER.  Yes.

WILCOX. Nominal compensation gains have been running in the neighborhood of MR. around 2 percent, so if you smooth through the employment and PCE prices, real compensation gains have been quite meager.

and all that, I take it that interest burdens may well be significantly see that in the top-left chart in exhibit 2, as an example.  I don't know how MR. FISCHER.  Thanks.  Michael, I'm just trying to figure out, even with this higher leverage and higher debt down.  You can general that is, but I assume it's pretty general?

As you can see on the right, for the business sector as a whole, debt growth that in the speculative-grade portion.  So it is the case that the trend That's reflective of the fact that it has been an area in which there has been a lot of 10 percent each year for three years. MR. KILEY. really hasn't looked like you've seen on the upper left is steeper for leverage than it would be for the overall business sector. growth-more than is the case that the interest expense ratio is depressed by the low level of rates today, so one might have concerns that that would reverse when the interest rate that to happen somewhat.  While leveraged loans tend to be even speculative-grade firms also issue high-yield bonds.  We It certainly interest rises.  Certainly we would expect floating rate, it is the case that

I low Nonetheless, we do think that leverage ratio, because interest rates are expected to stay these liabilities.

MR. FISCHER.  Thanks.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota.

Chair.  I have a couple of questions for about core price inflation.  And my other question tries to tie this back to the higher inflation.  That scenario seemed steeper Phillips curve than is usually used in the Tealbook, and I was wondering of the Phillips curve in exhibit 2. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam Steve.  In exhibit 2, you display the behavior of PCE price inflation in this alternative scenario.  I first had a question scenario in Tealbook A, which had a faster recovery with to rely on a what assumption was being used about the slope

On exhibit 2, that's total PCE prices.  And for core, the effect would much more muted, because there is an awful lot of kick in the total happening from The total increment here to headline inflation is about 1 percentage point, Â½ or Â¼ percentage point for the core prices. MR. KAMIN. definitely be the rise in oil prices. and it's more like alternative scenario that pertains to And your other question, I think, is referring to the the domestic economy.

KOCHERLAKOTA.  No, I'm sorry.  I complicated things. MR.

This one uses our standard SIGMA model, for which we have not altered Phillips-curve assumptions that we used in previous runs. MR. KAMIN. the

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Okay.  Thank you.

WILCOX. Just to be clear, think of a two-by-two matrix in which the columns are the rows are different assumptions about the Phillips curve.  Steve's that's different from the one that generated the alternative Tealbook A.  What we used was the FRB/US model with a juiced-up Phillips standard Phillips curve. MR. different models and presentation is in some diagonal simulation in curve.  What he used was SIGMA with SIGMA's curve is juiced up or not MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  And SIGMA's standard Phillips juiced up relative to FRB/US?

WILCOX.  I would answer, definitely juiced up.  It's much more price-responsive. MR.

EVANS.  Well, that's its normal state. MR.

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  That's its normal state, yes.

You know, the 'impact MR. KAMIN.  That's probably truest in the dynamics, right? effects' of shocks.

MR. WILLIAMS.  I helped work on-

-helped work on the FRB/US model.  It's quite an old-  [Laughter] MR. EVANS. Back when he was-

Internet. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Six years old.  [Laughter] MR FISHER. And Al Gore was running the the 'Weaker Wage Growth' simulations and how, when wage increases at their current low of 2 percent rate instead of picking up to that 3Â½ percent to 0.9 percent in 2018.  What's really interesting, of course, is the federal funds rate over this period is lifting off and going up to 3 percent.  During that the 'Faster scenario.  I confess I didn't read that very carefully, but I did numbers are quite different.  The funds rate is much higher at the end point, and at the end of the simulation period. MR. EVANS.  More seriously, I'd like to ask David if he could make a few comments on a couple of the alternative scenarios.  Picking up on Governor Fischer's question about wages, I couldn't help but notice are assumed to stay rate, total PCE inflation just goes that period, the economy is doing quite well, but there is a disengagement between economic activity and inflation.  So a few comments on that would be good.  Also, against that, there is Recovery with Higher Inflation' notice that the inflation only is at 2Â½ percent

like this analysis is another piece of evidence that shows it's a lot easier to rising inflationary pressures because we can increase the funds rate, but we have is going up, to what is going on-it's more difficult to get inflation up to target.  If It looks to me deal with trouble with these disinflationary periods in which-well, in this case, the funds rate so I'm not quite sure as you could comment along those lines, that would be helpful.

WASCHER. In the 'Weaker Wage Growth' one, the weaker nominal wage growth inflation, and, as you noted, real activity isn't really affected very MR. flows through into lower

January 27-28, 2015

way-when we run these simulations, we basically turn on the inertial version of the liftoff. much.  In a Taylor rule at

It doesn't seem to be very effective, does it? MR. EVANS.

WASCHER.  And it is the inertial part of it.  In general, it lifts off, but it's not very bringing inflation up.  The responsiveness of inflation in the model to activity isn't scenario in which footnote in one still lifts off at the same time, but the increase in the funds rate is much more in that version of the policy. MR. effective at very big, and I think that's what you're seeing there.  We did run an alternative we implemented the policy rule with an inflation floor included, and that's noted in a the text.  That gradual

That seems in keeping with my thinking that, when inflation is at these that is difficult to deal with, it requires a more this case, a 'flatter' Taylor rule.  That's what the MR. EVANS. relatively low levels because of something extraordinary use of accommodation-in inflation floor is doing, relative to what we would normally think.

WILCOX. There is a lot of model uncertainty surrounding this question, apropos of the SIGMA model. MR. the comment earlier about get at the characteristics of the analysis. MR. EVANS.  But I'm just trying to

much more powerful in the SIGMA model in is in the FRB/US model.  So monetary policy in FRB/US has a really MR. WILCOX.  Monetary policy is boosting inflation than it hard time getting inflation up to the 2 percent objective.

in this section of the FRB/US model, others that are generated using the model.  We think that's a virtue, to demonstrate for you the fact that one can develop We do some apples and oranges in presenting to you some scenarios Tealbook, some that are generated using the SIGMA

January 27-28, 2015

it's a useful reminder that this is an area where is a lot of uncertainty and some pretty heated debate about what the right response is. different results using different models.  I think there

That's fine.  The more damaging response that I was hoping I wouldn't frame, that inflation rate the inertia in inflation, so it's actually and thinking, 'That faster inflation, it's really not that bad of at 2Â½ percent.'  But if you told me that that was on its way to across these comment about uncertainty as to the mechanisms here also suggests a different situation.  We're in a situation right now in which inflation is below our just isn't that bad at the moment, because we need it to MR. EVANS. get back from you, which I didn't yet, is that, except for the 2018 time is actually still going up.  I would have guessed that it's much worse.  I'm pointing to this an outcome, because inflation is 3 percent, then I would say, 'Okay, that's more of a 'symmetry of distaste' simulations.'  But your we're in target, so something that lifts up inflation go up anyway.  That's how I come out from that.  Thank you.

on the capital ratios that you show on page 2.  How much different does ratio look when you use GAAP and net derivatives versus if you use international Is it a significant difference on that leverage ratio measurement? MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have two questions on the financial stability report.  One is the leverage accounting?

For the U.S. banks, I'm not actually sure of the answer to that.  I know MR. KILEY. that's a large issue when we make international comparisons.

the report draws.  The measures of cyclical vulnerabilities look fairly But it's not as clear to me how I should think about the state of structural in there.  And in the MS. GEORGE.  I assume it would be less, though, under those.  My other question is on the conclusions that reassuring. vulnerabilities and how you evaluate those relative to those conclusions

January 27-28, 2015

about that as being an important limitation of your ability to quantitatively system.  So my question is, really, how do you incorporate those In view of all of the reforms and changes that may be under way, where do you gauge in relation to the conclusions that you've report, it talks measure risk to the financial here? structural vulnerability, or how should I think about it drawn here?

Just to provide a little more context for your question, because your approach to developing the dashboard that's shown on your left page, that more or their historical perspective and uses historical cyclical perspective.  So, for example, if something looks very low right now, but very low is still a terrible position, our quantitative MR. KILEY. question did reference our additional chapter in our assessment in which we did a purely quantitative less basically compares a set of numbers with ranges as the benchmark.  That is purely a historically folks would say, 'Oh, that's fine, but structurally there may be a problem.'

factors that we looked at here.  Our looks at many others, but it faces the same set of challenges.  We try to say, look today relative to history?'  And that's easy, because in the case of 'Well, things are high or low, and and put together an assessment.  The more difficult challenge is that, it always was too low.  And so, of high now, but the question is:  Is it high enough? That supplemental report looks at many of the same judgmental report 'How do conditions those indicators for which we have some history, we can say, high is good or low is bad,' historically, there may be indicators-for example, like the historical amount of leverage of banking organizations-for which our assessment now is that course, it's are not green or yellow as the for capitalization in the bank sector, all of the numbers are much higher than before, If you look at the quantitative indicators, various categories they are in our judgmental assessment, but are ice-blue cold.  So, for example, if you look at picture

January 27-28, 2015

any other time for the data that we have.  Our judgmental assessment is, of banking organizations are much improved, that we've put in place banks have transitioned to them.  Indeed, they have in most cases leverage ratio under the proposed U.S. G-SIB surcharge.  Our be that if things are actually much improved, they may be green or ice-blue cold, like in the pure quantitative approach.  And then if much higher than at indeed, capital positions new requirements.  The already exceeded things like the assessment there would something.  I don't know about we were to look elsewhere, there really haven't been changes.  So that's why we have a green for financial-sector leverage and not a blue.

transformation, if you look at the chart I showed you, net shorta cyclical perspective.  In other charts that are in our report, and in liquidity risk in the banking sector.  Nonetheless, if we think of maturity transformation outside the banking sector through securitization or other that reflects more cyclical positions, and there structural reforms on the shadow banking side.  There we would still note money market reform will be.  Those proposals are cases as well. For example, on maturity term funding is much reduced from high-quality liquid assets are up within the banking sector.  So there seems to be a reduction in maturity transformation leverage or vehicles, those are much reduced, but some of haven't been as many that we have yet to see what the effects of only coming into effect next year.  We note increased liquidity transformation in mutual funds.  I highlighted bond and loan funds, but there may be other important, and that's why we more yellow assessment than the sort of blue thing.  I mean, the cyclical position our judgmental assessment would be, and that reflects the structural I think we do see the structural vulnerability as still being have a much looks weaker than what factors.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Thomas.

January 27-28, 2015

to quickly add one little bit President Evans's earlier question.  I think for the 'Weaker scenario, one thing to keep in mind is that, from the perspective of not the inertial but the Taylor (1999) rule, right now the funds rate is surprisingly depressed, as you already would be at 2 percent now. simulation is, effectively, this factor that is funds rate depressed.  So even though inflation is running so low, it's appropriate that policymakers gradually bring the funds rate back up.  I think the peculiar in that scenario, even though inflation is so low from a real-activity perspective, the the unemployment rate is running relatively low.  So though the economy is actually strong.  Now, this is how the scenario is is outside the scope of this scenario. MR. LAUBACH.  My apologies, Madam Chair.  I just want to David's and Steve's responses to Wage Growth' Taylor rule may remember from Tealbook B.  Taylor (1999) would say it And I think one thing that's going away in that keeping the under that rule thing is economy looks reasonably healthy because the rule looks at it as being constructed, and you might, of course, ask yourself, if you find yourself in such a situation, whether you then might want to reassess what, for example, the level of the natural rate is, but that

Right.  Thank you.  I think that's an example of why these simple rules rule like that, when all of or that's my interpretation of that.  Thanks. MR. EVANS. can often keep us well away from our goals because we're holding to a a sudden there's something else going on that's unusual historically.  We ought to offer some additional accommodation;

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Bullard.

When you're lot of model uncertainty as well and other types of uncertainty,' so the shaded region is MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have two questions for David Wilcox and one for Steve Kamin.  I'm looking at the forecast summary, panel 5, PCE prices. talking about output gap estimates, and we've talked about this issue before, you say, 'Well, there's a

January 27-28, 2015

amount of uncertainty associated with this estimate.  Then I go look at the prices, let's say, for the fourth quarter of 2015, and I wonder if something similar applies so this confidence region is actually much wider than it appears.  And what always gets me in is, it looks to me like half the probability is above 2 percent and half the below 2 percent.  So, really, insofar as we can learn something informative from coin flip whether headline Is that a fair assessment or is that an really understating the PCE that looking at these pictures probability is this model about inflation in the fourth quarter of 2015, it is that it's a inflation will be above or below 2 percent at that point. overstatement?

WILCOX. Well, let me clarify first.  My comments about the confidence interval state-based model.  Now, with think it's less obvious that the confidence interval there understates the true we use FRB/US-based stochastic simulations to generate the this panel, we also benchmark those against the actual track record of the little narrower for the model than for the staff real-time track record.  But the two are broadly consistent. MR. being understated pertained to panel 4, which comes out of the regard to panel 5, I uncertainty.  For one thing, while confidence intervals in staff in real-time forecasting, and we get confidence intervals that are a FRB/US

I think there are some important aspects of those confidence intervals that been digging into deeper lately, pertaining to issues like the ones that you raised about the course of the next six months or trying out some new products in the Tealbook that attempt to address those these confidence intervals as helpful, indicative, but even we that. That said, we've symmetry, for example.  And my expectation is that, over so, we're going to be kinds of issues.  For now, I take don't confuse them with the gospel truth or anything like inflation.  Because final meeting, I'll ask you whether it would be possible to do some of the MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  Let me turn to panel 6, then, which is core it's President Fisher's

January 27-28, 2015

That would be a pretty thoroughgoing exercise models.  This would not be a simple undertaking.  The structure of the model.  I don't that. MR. WILCOX.  Well, I hate to send President Fisher out on a disappointing note, but I'm a little skeptical because we'd have to recalibrate our implications of that, I think, would run fairly deep through the want to be encouraging about

MR. BULLARD.  You're saying you're going to use an inferior measure permanently.

WILCOX. We're going to use the measure that the Committee had indicated that it MR. is focusing on as their objective for monetary policy.

Some of the other projects that we have in mind for analytical will pay very big dividends.

Correct, yes. MR. WILCOX.

Okay. MR. BULLARD.

January 27-28, 2015

Chair, let it be recorded, I appreciate being fought over.

MR. FISHER.   Madam [Laughter]

Foreign Outlook,' I'm interpreting what you said was, you turned something in really not changing your world GDP outlook MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  Let me turn to the presentation 'The exhibit 1, panel 1, 'Foreign GDP.' to the Tealbook, but then the ECB surprised you to the positive side.  You upgraded the forecast, which is in panel 2, and now it looks like you're appreciably, according to my reading of panel 1.

increment announcement, was in the per year for all of the next few years.  With the euro area in in our foreign aggregate that's less than 20 percent, or in that was just a teeny bit below where think the story both before and after the announcement was pretty much the same, MR. KAMIN.  That's essentially correct, although the unexpected part of the to euro-area GDP growth that we have built in, in response to the neighborhood of Â¼ percentage point general having a weight neighborhood, it didn't end up changing the foreign GDP line that much.  So before the announcement, our current forecast, that black solid color line, it is now.  I which is that our outlook was broadly unchanged.

Well, I think one of the things that the Committee is going to debate is that it about the same? MR. BULLARD. uncertainty surrounding that outlook.  According to you all, has uncertainty associated with outlook changed, or is are plenty of uncertainties those have gotten over the past few months.  But I think you could argue that the ECB announcement, MR. KAMIN.  Well, okay.  So it's good to focus on the difference between the change in the modal outlook and the increment to the confidence interval.  There in the outlook, both on the upside and the downside, and arguably some of wider representing this forceful action by the ECB, might have diminished the downside risks for the

modal outlook for the euro area a bit, because all the those, for example, that might emanate from Greece. euro area in addition to boosting the additional asset purchases probably provide some cushion against financial downside risks, particularly

January 27-28, 2015

YELLEN.  Okay.  So next we have an opportunity to make comments on be recognized.  I'll start CHAIR financial stability, and I have, I believe, three people who have asked to with President Rosengren.

just want to follow up on President George's word 'reassuring,' and, I guess, when I look at the global context for 'reassuring' would probably not be how I would characterize it, and it gets to the overall forecast for Europe seems like improved with the policy change, the risk of a pretty bad outcome, that tail risk, probably has things going on with Russia and Ukraine. MR. ROSENGREN.  I'll be pretty quick.  I comment.  She used the financial stability, her comment on structural vulnerabilities.  So while it's gone up with the Greek election and other whether the domestic characterization of asset valuation, might be a different highlights, for example, the money market funds' holdings But during the fall of 2011, it seemed like the broker-dealers were mechanisms, in two respects.  One is, our monoline to create financial broker-dealers in the United States.  So a serious problem in Europe on mechanisms would be through the broker-dealers. And when I think about leverage, and maturity would pick up the global financial shocks, I'm not sure.  We've kind of structured our monitoring, which I think is very useful, to a domestic shock that occurred last time.  And if I think about importing a financial shock from abroad, that transmission mechanism.  The report of European securities. actually one of the major transmission broker-dealers got very elevated credit default swap rates, which started vulnerabilities potentially in the United States, and we started to get worried about some of the monoline investment banks.  And going the other way, European banks are still very large in terms of their very large transmission

about maybe thinking about financial stability shocks that are not Emerging markets and Europe right now would strike me as two areas. It's just a comment domestically oriented.

January 27-28, 2015

mechanism separate to think about at future times.  So that's just an observation that George's. We talk about the exchange rate and net exports, the financial transmission from those two might be an area follows up on President

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George. CHAIR

MS. GEORGE.  I'm not going to make any further comments.  I think Michael answered my question on structural issues.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  And, last, I have President Fisher's name, with a question mark.

ma'am. MR. FISHER.  No,

YELLEN.  Okay.  And is there anybody else who would like to comment.  Vice CHAIR Chair.

One thing I worry about, and I guess I'd encourage the that, in Germany and Japan right now, we have 10-year interest rates that are are going to move pretty substantially. useful to understand what the consequences of that type of bond market hundred basis points in a fairly short period of successful in what they are trying to engineer.  I just think that would be VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. staff to look at, is extraordinarily low.  And if central banks actually do achieve their objective of getting back to 2 percent inflation, it would seem that those bond yields And I think it would be revaluation might be, because it could be several time if they actually are worth taking a look at.  Thank you.

January 27-28, 2015

year looked at transmission channels to the United cetera.  So we have the past year or so, we feel that most of the through the economy, through real activity, and that the financial sectors the direct exposures.  That's not to say there can't be a lot of indirect could have large exposures to the EMEs. than banks do in the United States.  But, first order, it.  I think we've gotten a little bit of comfort.  I don't know if right word.  I don't think we used 'reassuring,' but we've gotten some steps to past couple of years.  So it's a trend.  We did, the EMEs and from China recently, in the past six months or year. them closely.  We'd be happy to send that to you if you haven't seen it. MS. LIANG.  We have in the past States from both the EMEs and China through-besides oil and the economy-financialinstitution channels.  And that would include, first and foremost, through the large banks, including broker-dealers and the trading books and the loan exposures, et tried to trace that, and in the end, at least over transmission will be themselves don't have exposures, because some of the European banks Almost certainly they have bigger exposures we have been looking at 'reassuring' is the comfort from the fact that institutions recognize these channels and have been taking reduce their exposures, especially to Europe, in the I think, evaluate shocks from We've looked at of our deep dives in the QS report, both turbulence, we looked very carefully not instabilities abroad, but also the channels by which they might system.  And our plans are to work more on this to formalize our and bring them into the overall picture of U.S. MR. KAMIN.

On the international front, obviously, the things that we have been most focused on are risks in Europe, Japan, and China.  But as we think about the continued dollar strengthening and a potential set of countries and financial markets and corporate sectors that have some exposures there.  And we're probably not that that.

We are, certainly. MR. KAMIN.

We are, absolutely.  We think we will have that in two meetings from now. MS. LIANG.

MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you.

The strength in consumer spending has also been driven, I worth.  My sense is that these will leave a more the decline in oil is likely to start out strong little earlier than in the Tealbook. With regard to national conditions, the key element in the Tealbook forecast is the trajectory of consumer spending.

The staff now expects consumption growth at about 4 percent this year and 3Â½ percent saw for this is likely to persist. income and real spending, but this is a one-time level effect, dissipate in a think, by improving labor markets and higher net lasting imprint on consumer spending growth after the one-time level effect of prices has played out.

The bottom line is, my GDP forecast would be it was in recent meetings. I also concur with several other elements of the Tealbook forecast.  Nonresidential investment looks positive, with an improved outlook for equipment and tangibles offsetting weakness in oil and gas exploration.

However, if oil prices have reached it appears may be the case, then the stability thus far of measures of inflation would make me fairly confident that we will emerge with inflation If oil prices inflation and bottom for this cycle, as expected expectations well anchored near our target, and that core inflation will move back to 2 percent. Barring further shocks, I would expect that to occur somewhat more rapidly than at the glacial pace shown in the Tealbook.

striking divergence between inflation compensation and inflation expectations over the importance of the distinction between the two.  At times it's compensation and expectations as synonymous, but I'm afraid that we are not difference in our external communications.  We have been the literal wording of our statement.  The last sentence in the first paragraph says, measures of inflation compensation have declined somewhat further; surveyThe the past few months highlights easy to treat always careful enough about this careful with 'Market-based based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.'  That's the sentence in the first paragraph.  But this may place too much emphasis on measures that we know are

It leaves out the fact that market-based measures of deemphasize inflation compensation and expected inflation. flawed as indicators of expected inflation expectations have also remained stable.

As a result, a very high they earned the same wage as they had a year earlier.  Now, in a recover, there is a stock of past-deferred wage cuts that need to be slowly the balance before finds further that needs to be worked off is bigger in those industries for which the most prevalent.  These are the industries in which wage growth has been slow relative to declines in unemployment.  In industries for rigidities are less widespread, nominal wage growth has returned to levels more consistent To explain this lag in wage acceleration, my staff nominal wages.  The constraint on due to the share of workers reported that flexible market, many of these workers would receive wage cuts during the recession.  So wage growth fell, in fact, by less during the recession than it would have otherwise.  As a result, once the economy starts to overcome as inflation and productivity growth bring real wages back into nominal wage growth can return to normal.  Additional recent work by my staff support for this mechanism by looking at cross-industry comparisons.  They show that this stock of pent-up wage cuts downward nominal wage rigidity appears to be nominal which with the current labor market conditions.

I'm going to respond briefly to Minneapolis has exposited in a recent We actually think that that distinction favors the usage of MR. some of the comments that President Lacker made about inflation compensation versus expectations.  You know, as the Federal Reserve Bank of memo, there is a distinction.

measure, one that I'm from, as opposed to actually relying on the hard data on one, where inflation is going to be going on an average basis in terms of what the real outcomes are that are going to be associated average for inflation.  When compensation declines, it could be either because the expectation with a very poor outcome in terms of real activity.  I think both of to be more concerned about a low inflation outcome than we would be an argument to be made, that we've made in the past, for focusing compensation as opposed to trying to tease out some magical expectation not sure exactly where it comes compensation.  Now, why do I say that?  It's because of the fact that compensation measures are compounding two different things: going forward, and, two, with the average inflation rate that people are expecting going forward is going down, or because they're associating that those should lead us otherwise.  So I think there's on compensation measures as opposed to what's a much more arduous measure of teasing out expectations.

there's room for rich debate on those topics.  I'd be very stick as much as possible to the factual statements in the first paragraph and, in time message about data dependence and transparency on the part of With all of that said, I think opposed to removing references to market-based compensation from the statement.  I think we should, first, second, removing that just because those are moving downward at this current moment does not send the right kind of this Committee.

returning to oil picture in prices are also going to be affecting my District through the Bakken Let me turn now to briefly discussing conditions in the Ninth District before the national inflation picture.  President Fisher did a great job of talking through the Texas, and the lower oil region of western North Dakota and eastern Montana, which has fewer people living in it than

We expect that the effects on investment and employment within western North Dakota more noticeable as we move through 2015. Texas. and eastern Montana will become in about 0.5 percentage point below its pre-recession low at the same time, wage pressures remain moderate, even in lowlike the Twin Cities, whose unemployment rate is 3.2 percent.  These different hypotheses.  One is that the natural rate of Another alternative is, as President Williams was making reference to, that is that inflation expectations have declined.  They would all push in the same of constraining wage growth. But the Ninth District economy remains strong.  Right now the unemployment rate Minnesota has fallen to 3.6 percent.  It is in 2006.  Interestingly, unemployment locales observations are consistent with a number of unemployment in Minnesota may be no higher, or may even be lower, than it was prior to the Great Recession. wage rigidities were more significant in the wake of this particular recessionary episode.  And another possibility direction

me to the national economy.  As many of you have noted in past meetings, about the near-term outlook, which is naturally well after those oil price effects wane, Tealbook A, projects that inflation will still target until 2019.  Furthermore, as the minutes from our inflation forecast in Tealbook A, is that longstaff currently estimate to be 1Â¾ percent, will rise back to is longer-run inflation expectations are at 1Â¾ percent, but they will rise back to the This brings 2014 was an outstanding year in terms of improvements in the labor market.  Despite those improvements, however, the inflation outlook did not improve, and by some measures deteriorated significantly.  I'm not talking here being dragged down by the unexpected decline in the prices of energy goods and services.  The issue is that rise very slowly, not returning to previous meeting note, the key assumption in the run inflation expectations, which the the Committee's goal of 2 percent.  So a key underlying aspect of the staff's forecast right now that

January 27-28, 2015

2 percent over time.  This is a fine benchmark assumption, and I don't I don't think we can take this assumption for granted.  Except for a couple of inflation has been below 2 percent for more than two and a half years, and here I'm strong.  All of these observations have the potential to create downside risk to the in the mind of the public about the inflation rate in the longer run.  In my view, we cannot be confident about the staff's inflation expectations unless our actions display a clear desire to inflation to target. Committee's goal of quarrel with it, but months in early 2012, PCE core inflation has been below 2 percent for more than six years. Headline referring to the 12-month trailing moving average.  Elsewhere around the world, disinflationary trends seem credibility of our inflation target-that is, doubts we will actually achieve assumption with regard to return month reinforces these credibility concerns.  In particular, market-based five-year, to new lows over the risen.  It is true that survey measures of long-term inflation expectations ranges, and that is comforting.  But if we think about this as a extraction problem, the overall signal about the credibility of our inflation target from both measures of longer-term inflation expectations has to be seen as sobering. The behavior of financial market prices over the past six months and, really, especially over the past five-year-ahead inflation expectations or compensation fell further intermeeting period.  The premiums that option traders are paying to insure themselves against low inflation have also remain within their historical signal kinds of

the recent gratifying improvement in labor market monetary policy even though inflation has remained I see credibility risks in basing our monetary policy choices too much on the way to interpret the monetary policy events of the 1960s and the public became convinced that the FOMC was basing its policy choices Many of you have suggested that performance justifies further tightening of muted.  But evolution of the real economy.  One the 1970s is that

As a result, the confidence in the FOMC's willingness to take systematic actions to keep inflation absence of inflationary pressures simply the 1960s and 1970s, this focus on the real side risk of unanchoring inflation expectations, but this time to the downside as opposed to largely on the evolution of employment rather public lost low, and inflation expectations became unanchored to the upside.  Fast forward to 2015, and the FOMC is contemplating tightening policy in the because employment has risen, quite smartly, for the past year.  Such a decision may suggest to the public that the FOMC is, again, basing its decision primarily on the real economy, as opposed to nominal measures.  And, just as in creates a the upside.

My view on the national growth will exceed 3 percent for all of 2015 and that job gains and unemployment declines will build on the below 5 percent in the third quarter that the Committee has generally tended to be too pessimistic with regard to labor two years.  In a recent speech titled 'Ghosts and Forecasts,' I recent years.  This evaluation covered projections made in June to December period-so, for instance, June 2013 for January to actual outcome.  So while you may think there's a lot of disagreement on evidently not enough disagreement.  The Committee's central tendency is enough to capture the actual outcome.  In each of the past two years, the Committee two years.  Unemployment rate forecasts are too high.  The Committee forecast were also too high. I note market improvements over the past evaluated Committee forecasts in for the entire subsequent January December 2014-this is all bad news, by the way.  The Committee's entire forecast range often does not encompass the the Committee, there's rarely wide has missed in the same way.  Forecasts of economic growth are relatively accurate, at least if you average over the higher unemployment than what actually occurred, and inflation forecasts The Committee tended to forecast higher inflation than what actually occurred.

to have moved the Committee The pleasantly surprising readings on labor market outcomes during the past two years would, under conventional monetary policy logic, be thought

Of course, the inflation in my view, the extent of that surprise was insufficiently large toward a more aggressive path data for June 2012 versus today suggests that policy rate path is labor markets packed a powerful positive surprise over the past two years expectations have moved in a dovish direction.  In my mind, this raises serious questions about the nature of the Committee's forecast was also inaccurate, but to rationalize the move toward a more dovish stance in the face of substantial labor market improvement.

I agree strongly with President Kocherlakota's decidedly mainstream analysis three weeks ago at the Becker Friedman it was a conversation in which Nobel Prize winner Lars Hansen was asking me comments on risk-neutral pricing, inflation expectations have dropped much lower or investors these data are flashing red.  Our recent FOMC statements seem to downweight these was suggesting just a few minutes ago that we should weight projections of financial that they have done, in addition a lot for all financial markets, declined to 1.8 percent.  And this is And this is for inflation 6 to 10 years ahead, so it's not good news for a longer-run period beyond the medium in terms of risk-neutral pricing.

Either are viewing low inflation as being associated with dramatically more costly economic outcomes. Either way, observations, and President Lacker them even lower in the statement.

I have several comments on this.  Let me start with to say I don't particularly find compelling-namely, that these could be just noise that we can safely ignore.  As I understand the of the contributors to it is now a staff member at the Federal Reserve liquidity premium between nominal and indexed Treasuries is a key part But liquidity is just a convenient label for a latent variable in this sounds relatively benign with that type of label, but it could include other unknown the way the Board staff described it, they used the Why should we ignore these signals? a benign alternative, which I have movements in breakeven rates Board model-and one Bank of Chicago-the of the decline in breakevens. analysis.

One model that does is the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's term structure its liquidity adjustment a good chance that what the Board model and some other models benignly something that could be a cause for concern. term 'term premiums,' actually attempt to identify liquidity effects from data, or model, and it attributes very little of the recent declines in breakevens to factor.  So there is label as liquidity or other premiums are really the effects on breakevens should be relatively transitory.  That is, the to be relatively It's a positive, not a normative, statement. meetings, we should rethink the and the weight we put on this benign interpretation of the decline a more problematic interpretation of these so-called could be persistent, namely that they could reflect increased preference for safe assets.  This would be consistent with President I think these are reasons not to downplay much more than we do. Whatever its interpretation, the time-series properties of these estimated liquidity premiums suggest underlying assumption that is used to estimate these finds that they ought transitory, and this is something that we can monitor. So if we don't see breakevens mean reverting over the next few role of such temporary factors in breakevens.  And, furthermore, there is liquidity premium developments, and one that a more persistent Kocherlakota's worrisome analysis, as I interpret it. this data, but to understand them

This Another not-so-benign possibility is low, and, indeed, some models require a number of assumptions to identify the pricing kernels.  Alternative implementations can give, and do give, different answers.  As I already mentioned, the Board analysis seems to be consistent with stable inflation expectations.  Another approach is the term structure model developed by Luca Benzoni

To assess inflation pressures more directly, this analysis relies more inflation to better capture the five-year, December 2017 is 1.62 percent.  This is average inflation too low. analysis doesn't make reference to to examine on the breakdown of inflation among food, energy, and core dynamic relationships between interest rates and inflation.  These model forecasts for five-year-forward inflation also have come down about 20 basis points over the past year.  More important, the model is projecting very low inflation for quite some time.  The three-year-ahead average PCE inflation forecast for from December 2017 to December 2019.  That's longer-run inflation expectations in assess stability of inflation expectations.  In contrast, some analyses appeal to the horizons to achieve reasonably stable longerstopped clock.  Longer-run measures don't move much, and I'm skeptical as meaningfully at times of risk, and that's something that President Rosengren was mentioning with regard to Japan. the case that the survey respondents see a looming risk, but they are confident that we, FOMC, will act appropriately?  Do we even agree among ourselves on what these should be?  The divergence between market and survey measures gives me Our Chicago model also does not use surveys of order to stability of survey measures of inflation at longer run inflation projections.  I worry that survey measures of longer-horizon inflation expectations are like looking at a to whether survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations move great Or is it the appropriate actions great concern.

As a result, I continue to anticipate economic and labor market conditions improvements to provide For the nation as a whole, my outlook for economic activity is previous meeting.  Weaker foreign economic but lower energy prices, on net, should provide a moderate growth of around 3 percent this year.

Furthermore, I do not think in an environment of above-trend economic growth and falling unemployment my forecast implies that inflation return to 2 percent.  Thank you, While inflation is running below our this point that the goal of price stability over the we can judge the cost of low inflation in isolation from other economic developments.  Inflation below target seems less of a concern to me than low inflation combined with slowing economic growth and rising unemployment.  As oil prices and the dollar stabilize, will move upward, and spare capacity and tightening of labor markets will gradually lift inflation back toward target.  So unless signs emerge that the economy's performance is faltering, I see no need to delay normalization for the purpose of accelerating a Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman. CHAIR

DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My views on the economy changed much since the previous FOMC meeting.  I view the incoming data as While it's true there have been some data points that have be anomalies that will be reversed VICE CHAIRMAN haven't consistent with an economy that continues to grow at an above-trend pace, marked by rising household and business confidence. raised some questions-for example, for December, we had a weak retail sales report and a decline in average hourly earnings-I view these as likely to in the coming months.

the timing of the effect of the decline on oil factor appears to be supporting consumer spending.  But, against this, we have One question I have been wondering about is prices on U.S. economic activity.  We have the positive benefit of lower oil prices boosting real income, and this

Although I agree with the effect is a positive, I wonder about the timing in which these effects fall. trajectory of economic as a positive, and investment later as a negative, which would expectation in terms of relative timing, that suggests that there is a risk that the economic growth fades as we get deeper into the year.  I raise this issue as it might to thinking about the appropriate timing of monetary policy liftoff. the prospect conclusion that the net Does the boost in consumer spending happen first, followed by the drop in investment, or not?  I think understanding the likely timing here will help us better assess the growth.  If it is consumption first be my own momentum to be relevant compensation.  If growth of wages and labor compensation stays steady or firms in the face of declining headline this implies more real income growth, all else being equal.  And it also implies the lower headline inflation rate or the drop in market-based measures of inflation In terms of Federal Reserve Bank of New York's consumer expectations year ahead in terms of household income most recent National Federation of Independent reporting increase of 4 points from their prior monthly surveyAnother key issue for me is the trend in wages and labor nominal inflation, then that compensation are not having strong depressing effects on the wage-setting process. labor compensation, some of the survey measures I have seen recently imply strengthening rather than weakening.  For example, the survey indicates a generally firming trend for one growth expectations.  And in the same vein, the Business survey showed a firming compensation trend, with a net 25 percent of firms paying higher compensation-that's an and a net 17 percent planning to raise compensation in coming months.  That's up 2 points over the prior survey.

level of full employment.  In the last SEP to 5 percent.  I think there is The second issue that I'm focused on is the round, I lowered my estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate

January 27-28, 2015

too high.  There are several reasons why my estimate is workforce are consistent with a lower longer-run because older age cohorts typically have lower asked my staff to isolate how much lower the current full-employment with its value in earlier periods, if the only thing that the way back to 1980, the the changing age composition of the labor force is worth nearly a full percentage in the longer-run unemployment rate.  Nearer at hand, comparing the situation with 2004, reached 5.6 percent, the same level as the shift is worth about 0.2 percentage point. some risk that this estimate is still coming down.  First, demographic trends in the unemployment rate.  The composition of the workforce is getting older, and this should be pushing down the longer-run unemployment rate unemployment rates.  I unemployment rate would be, compared had changed was the age composition of the labor force.  If we go all net effect of point which was when in that cycle the unemployment rate first it is now, full-employment unemployment rate depends on what is happening labor markets in different regions.  If there's a lot of dispersion in labor markets, some full-employment all else being equal.  With the drop in oil prices likely to hurt states that have higher labor demand and lower unemployment rates, I across the country should lessen, and this the longer-run unemployment rate a bit.  We tried to estimate how turns out this effect is likely to be quite small-no more than Second, the national in the very tight and others very loose, then this should lead to a higher national unemployment rate, disproportionately those would expect the dispersion of labor market conditions should directionally lower much this might be worth, and it 0.1 percentage point.

not a sufficient statistic of labor market unemployment rate understates the degree of slack in the the degree of slack relative to the full-employment Third, as we all know, the unemployment rate is slack.  To the extent that the current labor market, it also understates

January 27-28, 2015

think this is very much the case today.  To assess this effect, one can to which there is underutilization of the labor force-for example, part-time time-relative to the unemployment rate.  In this cycle, the rate is unusually low compared with the amount of slack measured by those who in relation to past cycles, currently, so that's a gap of 0.5 unemployment rate.  I measure the degree workers who want to work full unemployment want to work more hours.  If we normalize the underutilization of hours this would imply an unemployment rate of about 6.1 percent percentage point.

rate and the employment cost index is only running at about an annual rate of Now, I'm not sure what this precisely means in terms of how much slack we have this low, it would seem to allow us the ability to be somewhat more The final factor that might be relevant is the fact that labor compensation and inflation trends are unusually low at the current unemployment rate.  Real total compensation based on the core PCE inflation Â½ percent. and what that means for the full-employment unemployment rate, but when the labor compensation trends are patient.

I've been thinking a lot about is the outlook for foreign economic mixed view.  On the one hand, and I think this is consistent Kamin's briefing, the pessimism about the outlook for growth abroad looks a bit to Europe and Japan.  When I look at both Europe and Japan, less fiscal drag.  The ECB's QE has gotten good reviews so far.  And most noteworthy to me was Mario Draghi's inflation objectives to be ended is, I think, very, very important. A third issue that growth and the dollar.  Here I have a with Steve overdone, especially with respect while I see plenty of problems, I also see a number of positives, including lower oil prices, weaker currencies, more expansive monetary policies, and initiative comment that the program will continue until the ECB expects its achieved.  The fact that it's open

A firmer dollar is risk to our forecast.  Thank you, Madam Chair. On the other hand, I am intensify.  QE in both Japan and Europe certainly would seem to push in this direction.  I understand the reasons for the Tealbook's forecast for the dollar.  If it was obvious would continue to appreciate, then it would already have happened.  Nevertheless, of a rising inflation.

I'll before, but I guess we're taking a around the table are around 3 percent.  The Tealbook has 2.8 percent, essentially, for course, the unemployment rate is now very close to our estimates of the We have consumer sentiment doing very well.  We have low oil prices, which the economy.  This, includes President Fisher, who sees the prices as well, but he came out in favor of a net positive effect.

natural rate of unemployment.  I'm going said here before, and I apologize, but I think it happens to be true, so I'll I want to say a word about our estimates of the to say something I've keep saying it.  If you look at what economists say the natural rate of unemployment is and run a

stated natural rate is plus half the gap between the actual unemployment rate and 4.5 percent.  So poor Dudley worked very hard to come to roughly-[laughter]-that estimate. regression on it-and when I say 'economists,' I'm usually talking about Bob Gordon, who at some stage used to produce an estimate of the natural rate of unemployment with sufficient frequency that you could run regressions on it-what you find is that the 4.5 percent Vice Chairman

Could have saved a lot of work. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

There is a tendency to reduce our estimate of the natural rate as comes down, but at some point that stops.  It will be at 4.5 percent, maybe.  Bill is right that it's now about 5 percent. MR. FISCHER.  Yes. the unemployment rate 4.8 percent effect on the world than you might have guessed.  It's affecting and if you go down the list of countries that produce find they're all being hit a slowdown, but that's what it is.  We've also got to worry about Greece a lot of alarm bells ringing about Greece, even if the it turns out to stay in Europe.  We've got Ukraine, and that one is really a getting very ugly.  But have the ECB having undertaken this very brave and very difficult set of measures, executive board.  And we've also got the I want to talk next about foreign activity and how to think about that.  China has slowed down.  That has a much bigger Australia, it's affecting Latin America, metals and other commodities-Brazil, Chile, and all the others-you'll by the slowdown in China.  Now, you know, it is a slowdown from 10 percent to 7 percent, and it seems funny to call it because we're certainly going to get likelihood is that potentially huge mess, and we've got a war in the Middle East, which is we do now which Mario Draghi managed to get through his Japanese trying to restore their economic growth.

about covered interest arbitrage or they don't If you ask what is happening in our capital markets, I think it's that interest rates are very low everywhere else, and people don't know

January 27-28, 2015

rates apparently never that is driving our rates down.  The major us is the appreciation.  As we saw in the Tealbook, its effects about two years out stays roughly where it is prices stay roughly where they are.  They probably won't.  They'll probably go up believe in it, one or the other.  So they're coming here, because exchange change in their minds.  And that's, I think, an element problem for outweigh the effects of the benefit from oil, assuming the exchange rate now and oil some.

interest rates, we need to go to inflation.  Well, what Tealbook, core inflation was 1 percent last quarter and will 2015.  They have it at 1.7 percent at the end of 2016 and at the end of 2017.  So what do we do, and how do we think about that?  Well, I have time, and that tells us what we should do.  We losses, the square of the divergence between inflation and target squared.  That has a nice, smooth you something like the Taylor rule when combined with a model.  It has sign on the interest rate and unemployment with a negative sign on the some time if unemployment is at the natural rate, we can't move until the to the target rate of 2 percent.  That's how the conversation is going, but, in So now, having talked about lower are we looking at?  According to the be 1.8 percent in the second half of 1.9 percent to think about the consensus statement all the should have a balanced approach.  The balanced approach is essentially summarized by the utility function, which weights inflation squared and unemployment and the natural rate tradeoff, and it will give inflation with a positive interest rate, and you trade the two of them off.  Now, what I've been listening to for is a different utility function.  It's called the Leontief utility function, which says that our utility is the minimum of the difference between inflation and expected inflation and unemployment and the natural rate-that is, inflation rate gets fact, our consensus statement says we trade things off.

January 27-28, 2015

material that came through, I noticed, quite a few times, more seems to be something that changed-and I'll explain how that happened-because a few months ago several people tradeoff that what we say in the anything about the interest rate at this point.  In fact, that tradeoff says it will give more In reading through all the implicit acceptance of the view that we're going to have to push unemployment below the natural rate in order to get inflation up.  And that ask the staff afterward to here were dead-set against that possibility.  But I think there's a consensus statement would require us to take into account, and it wouldn't necessarily say you can't do weight to the unemployment rate.  At some point when we see any signs of progress, when the unemployment rate is going down below the natural rate, we will be beginning to look at raising the interest rate.

we going to do?  Well, we're faced with a very tough choice, but I don't of thinking we can't move at all until the inflation rate hits roughly what I've been hearing.  And I know that this is unpopular, but I between 1.8 percent and 2 percent inflation in terms of its on the welfare of the representative consumer in the United States.  And it's true we wrote I think our lack of knowledge of what precisely is the relationship between the inflation and utility of ordinary individuals is quite considerable. So what are think we should proceed on the basis 2 percent, which is think we do not know the difference effect down 2 percent.  I would have been more comfortable working with a range of the inflation rate, because rate those tradeoffs further tomorrow.  And I my guess is we can move from here.  And you lower bound with high probability.'  First of all, it's not high FRB/US model We will make those decisions.  We will discuss do want to add one thing.  I'm very uncomfortable working at the effective lower bound.  I know that everybody says we can't move from here, but say, 'We'll go back to the effective probability in the very excellent analytic work we've been given, and using the

January 27-28, 2015

that it doesn't make much difference if you go sooner or go We'll have to discuss this tomorrow, but I suggest we don't discuss it in terms of the idea is no tradeoff until you're right at the point of inflation at 2 percent and unemployment to run stochastic simulations tells us later. that there at the natural rate.  Thank you.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota. CHAIR

want to follow up on what you've said, time than is envisioned in the Tealbook, for example, are that interest rates would what you were saying? MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Governor Fischer, I just to understand better.  So the costs of our current policy of remaining accommodative, maybe for a longer remain unnaturally low, artificially low, and that unemployment would fall below U *.  Is that an accurate summary of part of what I was saying, yes.  That's not the whole story. MR. FISCHER.  That's

a de minimis loss associated with having MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  And that there's inflation run at 1.8 percent as opposed to 2 percent?

minimis loss for two reasons.  Number one, those utility functions little cost to being 0.1 percentage point or 0.2 percentage point away from target.  So tradeoffs, of course, they are not very large.  And, is substantial uncertainty about this.  I promise you-and I have the data to meant that when you got to 2.6 in trouble.'  So then a lot of bumping around. MR. FISCHER.  A de have very just by the nature of what we assume about the second, I think there prove it-that I wouldn't worry about 2.4 percent inflation either, and I didn't.  We were allowed between 1 and 3 percent, and being between 1 and 3 percent percent, you started saying, 'Shucks, if we get above 3, we're going to be you'd start doing things.  But there's about helpful, but they are not necessarily a guidepost in and of themselves. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  As I think about what you've said, the observations inflation are

January 27-28, 2015

MR. FISCHER.  No, they're not.

KOCHERLAKOTA.  Simply saying 1.8 percent is close to 2 percent, well, could also be close to 2 percent.  We could wait until we get to 2.2 percent.  The cost MR. 2.2 percent side is very helpful for me in understanding your perspectives.

MR. FISCHER.  Yes.  Okay.

Thank you, Madam Chair.  This will be fairly easy for number of people have One, I obviously agree with everybody that general improvement has continued since previous meeting.  I'd just observe in passing that it was a very damaged economy that lot of improvement.  And improvement has never been all that rapid, I, again, don't think it proves too much to say we're continuing to improve.

over the weekend to make sure he inflation so that I'd be able to piggyback on his comments, but happily I is-in saying I this as a downside risk rather than as a modal expectation.  But it's a very troubling one, if and a nonmacroeconomist by training my professional life, I continue to be bemused by the concept of anchored inflation Tealbook, for example, that the staff models downplay the Second, and I did check with President Kocherlakota was going to address can now piggyback on what Presidents Rosengren and Evans said as well.  I guess I'm probably slightly different-although maybe not too different from where President Evans regard it were to be realized.  And, again, as a noncentral banker in most of expectations.  I mean, it does seem to me that an awful lot depends on anchored inflation expectations.  I notice in the current decline in TIPS compensation precisely because the surveys suggest that expectations remain

January 27-28, 2015

must be okay.  An awful lot of work is being required of a factor that, me slightly nervous, but it doesn't seem to make most of know what to make of that. anchored, therefore it all so far as I can tell, is still not particularly well understood-that is, where it comes from and how it actually functions. That just makes you nervous.  So I don't couple of people elaborated and actually began to try to quantify some, which is the the estimates most of us, including the Tealbook, rate plugged into any one of the various models that are used results in a liftoff and differences in what you do with regard to monetary policy And then, finally, on labor markets, I want to pick up on something a alluded to, and then Bill possibility that the natural rate is lower than have.  And this is obviously really important, because, as I understand it, any significant difference in the natural quite different timing of thereafter.

necessarily believe to be the case, but I just want Bill mentioned as potential points that may argue for the the natural rate is flip side of the low labor force participation rate relative to what we would have low as it has been.  That is, as unemployed may be more attached to the workforce and unemployed, but who are actually less tied to or qualified for to some degree, or a theoretical possibility, but it is buttressed by the fact that, from unemployment to out of the labor force has actually I'm not about to argue something that I to supplement some of the things possibility that the natural rate is lower.  To some degree, the possibility that lower is the expected with demographic trends, which is to say, lower, but not as people who are currently categorized more skilled than the norm for unemployed workers historically.  In addition, a lot of people who would have formerly been listed as work, may now be listed as out of the labor force.  And, by the way, there are a bunch of younger people who have parked themselves in school somewhere, waiting for things to improve.  Now, that's an intuition contrary to expectations, the exit rate

January 27-28, 2015

into account-has been low.  So all of that would at least suggest, though not markets I've been noticing for the past several years, every almost always has an fallen relative to what it was pre-crisis, and entry into the labor force-again, taking demographics prove, that the quality, if you will, of those currently listed as unemployed is higher than the group historically included in that category of unemployment, and, therefore-no pun intended-naturally, there would be a lower natural rate.  Maybe that's not true, but here, as with so many things with respect to labor argument on one side, like on the issue of whether wages are about to rise, equally good argument on the other.

survey predicts wages are going to rise. two years.  Someday it's going to be right.  But it hasn't been to mean all that much.  Again, things like the quits rate-yes, it is still not where it it actually dipped back down a little bit during Q4.  So, again, let's not the next go-round is about.  Thank you. The NFIB thing is my latest example.  The NFIB It has been doing so for the past date, and so to me it doesn't actually the quits rate has improved, but (a) it improved really only modestly, (b) was pre-crisis, and (c) make too much out of things until we actually see something a bit more tangible, which I would come back to and say would be wages again.  And I'm not going to discuss the implications of this, Madam Chair, because I think that's what

YELLEN.  I believe you're right.  Thank you.  Governor Powell. CHAIR

try to take advantage of that.  On the real economy, as we all know, we have two pretty strong years, and I would also say that there has been momentum in the second half of last year.  And we are Tealbook forecast to eliminate slack at a rapid pace, fully MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  This seems like a good opportunity to be succinct, so I will been through what are apparently quite a meaningful gain in seeing numbers that seemed out of reach for many years after the crisis.  The is that we will continue on that path and continue

January 27-28, 2015

And I'm comfortable with that Tealbook points out that PDFP has been even stronger than GDP energy prices, and higher consumer is every reason economy to continue on that path. admitting that we don't forecast.  In particular, the against a background of strong job growth, lower confidence.  That dynamic seems to me very likely to continue, and I think there to expect the real the risk of weakness abroad.  It's worth that those effects are already incorporated in the Tealbook to a significant extent strong dollar.  Of course, the dollar can still go higher.  There can be bad geopolitical as a result of lower oil prices with a lower euro and other effects of QE.  So I wouldn't currently balanced, but I would say they are coming closer to being The big issue that we've been over and over is pointing out through the events.  On the other hand, we have perhaps some hope in Europe and much better financial conditions say those risks are at all balanced.

President Lockhart referred to as the 'big disconnect' economy and wages and prices, and interest rates as well, and how to think is that the effects of both the oil shock and the increase in the trade-weighted terms-will pass, and, indeed, we will more comfortable readings on both headline and core inflation rates in the second half a while. And that leaves you with what between the real about that.  And it's very discomfiting, and we're just not going to know with any confidence for a while.  But what I would expect dollar-assuming the dollar flattens out in see much of next year.  But we won't know that, I think, for on inflation compensation, I talked about it at the previous meeting at go over it again, but I do continue to think that much of that is not point that if it's not representative of expectations, then at some point it should be On market readings some length, and I won't really expectations.  On the other hand, I profess no certainty on that, and I think President Evans made a great

January 27-28, 2015

On the one hand, we see domestic activity continuing to strengthen, and on the other activity, I thought a banker in President Lacker's remarked that business conditions are as normal as any time he has seen And I think 'normal' is the year as a claims remaining at a low level and job openings remaining elevated, it going to continue to see gains close to this magnitude in the first part of to push the unemployment rate down and should continue to put on the participation rate to keep it from falling despite the downward Job growth in December, at about 250,000, was similar to the average for whole.

The data on consumer spending has been, on balance, positive, and further declines in energy prices, along with a substantial consumer sentiment, should support compensate for the drop that President Fisher

Investment spending is housing starts that improvement, particularly in the labor market, we have seen no broad-based is a puzzle.  The news on inflation has also been dominated by oil prices.  While I think we should expect to see the effect possibility that deflationary shocks is likely to be below 1 percent in December.  Survey-based measures, as many have the hope that, when the effect of oil I am mostly comfortable looking through the sharp decline in oil regard to market-based measures of decline.  Because those measures are likely downside. Despite acceleration of wages, and that continued declines, particularly from of these declines to be temporary, I am concerned about the may continue for some time and eventually feed through to expectations.  The news on core inflation was a bit softer than expected, and the annualized three-month change in core PCE prices pointed out, have held steady, a development that holds out and dollar shocks subside, and as resource slack continues to diminish, inflation should move up toward 2 percent.  But while prices, I am increasingly uncomfortable doing the same with inflation compensation, which have continued to more forward looking than survey-based measures, I don't think we can dismiss the possibility that the risks to inflation and inflation expectations are on the

In particular, the over the past year.  Two aspects of that decline are noteworthy.  First, out along the appear term premium.

January 27-28, 2015

and in this regard I think two explanations merit particular attention. the one that has been cited here:  Extremely low longer-term interest rates in advanced global economic outlook may be exerting easier scenario to deal with.  But risk of higher inflation low inflation will coincide with unfavorable macroeconomic states, nominal Treasury securities have attractive returns.  This term premium has declined.  This scenario was laid out very memo from President Kocherlakota, and it is given some weight in the in the Tealbook that shows a striking shift in market-based measures toward a higher I think understanding why this decline is happening is important for our policy deliberations tomorrow, First, foreign economies and concerns about a weaker downward pressure on yields.  That one, I think, is a slightly the second is that there is some evidence that market participants may have materially altered the probability they assign to low inflation outcomes and weak economic conditions.  Previously, when market participants appeared to be most concerned about the coinciding with unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, nominal Treasury securities had to yield more in order for investors to hold them.  More recently, this concern appears to have been replaced by the concern that conditions.  In these consideration could explain why the nicely for us in an earlier chart probability being placed on low inflation outcomes.

and related again, there is something that many have commented on, the strong backdrop of weak foreign economic growth and one sector of the U.S. economy other than oil unfavorable is net exports.  Since last summer, models suggest such an increase will eventually Finally activity domestically comes against a divergent deflationary pressures from abroad.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Well, let me thank everyone for another very thoughtful to actual progress we have made in achieving our dual CHAIR round of observations on the outlook.  I will, as usual, try to summarize a few of the main themes in your remarks, especially as they relate

And while pickup in wage growth.  Several of you noted that surveys hint that wage up, but that's something we haven't

This is something, as Governor that at this point more slack may be employment or individuals who are not working but not actively looking and are, therefore, counted as out of the labor force.  That may be another factor to estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate, and I would add that those who, for all these reasons, have recently revised down my own estimate.

I thought the Tealbook had an interesting box this time that discussed Of course, it's also comments, that the behavior of wages may continue to be influenced by downward nominal wage rigidity.  If firms were constrained from cutting wages less pressure to raise them now than would be expected on the basis of the existing degree of labor market slack.  In other words, a stock of pent-up wage deflation may currently wage increases down.  But as this source of restraint erodes, in the behavior of nominal Fisher has the implications of this type of view.

Many of you mentioned that net exports in the spending from lower oil certainly

One possibility is that we are simply world, which has seen an expectation of quantitative easing the main scenario, that would seem to be a factor for our national forecast.  But as several of you noted, other scenarios or the low level of rates may reflect low inflation With respect to financial rates a variety of scenarios with different seeing spillovers from the rest of the and has had weak economic conditions.  And if that's positive explanations are also possible, in particular that expectations or expectations of weak economic growth.

The staff that core PCE inflation will continue to run close to 1 percent during the in the spring, and that's a downward revision.

Some of you the dollar since our previous meeting will put additional downward pressure imported goods and other commodities-and thereby lower readings on inflation the further in oil prices may also spill over into lower core inflation.

But as you noted, it is not obvious, for reasons that Presidents Kocherlakota and Evans that this is an entirely comforting interpretation.  And I also noted comments that, measures may be stable, this is not entirely reassuring, as we saw stability of Japan as well.  So, clearly, this is something that needs close I did hear some general concern about the continued decline of inflation compensation and the starting to drift.  Of course, as many of you noted, statistical models we look at suggest downdrift mainly a number of discussed, while survey longer-run inflation expectations in monitoring.

Then I'd like everyone that incoming data provide confirmation that the labor toward a more normal state.  And, knock on wood, I am progress toward fulfilling the employment leg of our dual reassuring that job growth actually could slow appreciably from its recent above staff estimates of the rate of job creation that is consistent with an think this is fortunate, because I am in the camp that thinks we some ways to go before we are back to maximum employment.

I still have measured on a cyclically adjusted basis, the number of long-term unemployed workers and the percentage of involuntary part-time workers remains elevated, while the

And, as I mentioned, I have also revised to the inflation leg of our mandate, as it would rate remains low. understates the true degree of slack in the labor down my estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate.

The wage not only for the inflation outlook, but also for the strength of consumer worry that if wage growth doesn't pick up, and it does pick up in the staff forecast, In contrast, incoming data-particularly the lower-than-expected core CPI inflation reading for dollar-have, to my mind, made the surprisingly steep decline we saw in the growth of average hourly earnings may well prove an aberration.

But I am fact we need to take into account when we consider the appropriate time to begin reassure me that longer-run inflation anchored, but I, too, am increasingly disturbed by the months. increased desire on the part of investors I certainly haven't given up on my forecast that, in an environment of diminishing slack, inflation will move back to our 2 percent goal over the next two or three concerned that, at midyear, PCE inflation will be running below 1Â½ percent on a 12-month basis, and that's a tightening.

For risk that poor economic performance abroad will result in a low equilibrium real funds rate, and subdued inflation.  If investors prove to be apt to boost the funds rate much less than we envision in the SEP forecasts, but in to concerns for us for the foreseeable future.  On the other hand, investors may be too about global risks, and they may alter their views over time.  And if that's the case, I global in longer-term interest rates.  If such occur quickly, we could see significant disruptions in financial markets.

January 28 Session

YELLEN.  Good morning, everybody.  We are going to start things off this testing proposals, and I'm going to turn things over to Josh Frost. CHAIR morning by coming back to the

Chair.  In yesterday's discussion, the interest in having the staff put forward two proposals for testing includes further testing of term RRPs over the March quarterincludes the March quarter-end tests and a series of small-term MR. FROST. 8   Thank you, Madam Committee expressed term RRPs-one that end only and one that RRP tests in February and early March.

RRPs over the March quarter-endrefinements that Lorie mentioned yesterday. the amount of term RRP offered to $200 billion to improve our understanding effect of decreased capacity; two, have the term RRPs mature across multiple three, make modest changes to the frequency and operations and shorter maturities; a spread above the ON RRP rate on the target for the The first option-further testing of term would include the four operational These refinements are based on lessons learned from the tests over year-end and are outlined in the top panel of exhibit 1.  To reiterate, the four refinements are:  one, reduce of the days in early April to avoid operational risks associated with having all of the operations mature on the same day; tenor of term RRP operations, resulting in fewer and four, express the maximum bid rate as day of the operation to better allow for the possibility of a change in the federal funds rate following the announcement of the term RRP offerings but before the actual operations commence.

option includes a series of small tests of term RRPs in February and tests that I just discussed.  A structure of these non-quarter-end tests is outlined in the bottom panel of the the market requires on term RRPs to induce such substitution. The second early March, in addition to the March quarter-end possible exhibit 1.  If the Committee wanted to pursue these tests, it could authorize the Desk to offer a series of relatively short-term RRPs in modest sizes to learn more about degree of substitutability between overnight and term RRPs, and to get more insight into the rate staff a series of term RRP operations in February and March with a size limit of is the case with the quarter-end term RRP limit would be in addition to the $300 billion daily limit on the overnight To best balance the desire to learn about these issues with an inclination to keep the size of such tests relatively small, the Committee might want to instruct the to conduct $50 billion outstanding at any one time.  As testing, this RRP.

The operations could also These operations could be conducted beginning on Thursday, February 12, and all mature by Thursday, March 12.  These dates would ensure not conflict would all mature prior to the Committee's

January 27-28, 2015

coming days, it is likely that we would plan to start relatively maximum bid rate of the prevailing ON RRP a series of four one-week operations every be subject to a maximum bid rate of the prevailing ON RRP rate plus 5 basis points, and be awarded via a single-price auction.  While the exact terms of these tests would be determined in the small at around $10 billion and utilize a rate plus 5 basis points, and conduct Thursday from February 12 through March 5.  In the coming days, Simon Potter would inform the Committee of the detailed terms of the first of the planned operations after obtaining the Chair's approval.

Thank you, Depending on which option the Committee chooses, the Desk could release a statement following this future Desk statement.  Draft resolutions authorizing each are provided in your handout as exhibit 2.  We associated with each of the options Madam Chair.

Williams. would June quarter-end, abstracting from what monetary policy will or will not CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Are there questions for Josh?  President MR. WILLIAMS.  I just have a question about option 1.  Looking forward, what be our plan about the do?

As Vice Chairman Dudley discussed, I think we will recommend testing Q1.  I think the appropriate way to a Desk statement come out at the April meeting, or it's possible March meeting.  But it's important that we have some interval in order to testing and it's not an indication of any change in the policy statement. MR. POTTER. over the June quarter-end if we go ahead with this test over do that as a test would be to have we could do that at the show it is

WILLIAMS. The idea, if I may, would be that if we were to use this on a point? MR. permanent basis, we would announce it at what

The main option you have is the directive to the Desk, and you could put directive that you vote on at each meeting.  If, for example, at the June meeting you increase the federal funds rate target range, you could take the testing that we're doing the limit on it, if you wanted more comfort.  We would probably is no signal.  If at that meeting you decided that MR. POTTER. this into the voted to and you could increase recommend to go with the $200 billion, so there

January 27-28, 2015

you wanted to raise rates, you could then direct the Desk to have more capacity than that $200 billion.

foreseeable future we plan about.  I mean, we would be out of the testing stage. MR. WILLIAMS.  But would we be announcing that for the to do quarter-end?  That's what I was asking in the directive, it will be out of the testing stage.  But meeting. MR. POTTER.  At the moment it's the directive is just for the period through the next

WILLIAMS. It would just be a statement about the period through the next long as we were using term RRPs. MR. meeting, and we would repeat that as

MR. POTTER.  Yes.  But there might be some more communication to help the market understand the regime that we would be operating in.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lacker. CHAIR

MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you.

the value you folks see in this.  I believe I heard you rate at which term substitutes for overnight.  A general that it would be higher than the rate on overnight, but now I'm trying to think difference it would make to me as a Committee member to know what that rate is. it would be to the Committee?  Or do you have some other 15, what difference is it going to make to the MR. LACKER.  Yes.  Josh, on option 2, about the testing small operations in February and March, I want to understand more about say that it would be informative about the expectation is about what Do you have a sense of what value purpose in mind for this test?  If it's 8 or 10 or

Committee to know what that rate is?

Chair, may I augment that question, please? MR. FISHER.  Madam CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes.

January 27-28, 2015

these smaller tests be a useful exercise just in terms of getting better muscle MR. FISHER.  I'd like to also know in answer to the question, from the Desk's standpoint, would tone?

in terms of what you would learn from the rate information, just relatively little premium that would need to be offered into term.  Instead, suppose it was 10, 15.  I would think it would be useful for the Committee to have some understanding of just how much of a two. MR. FROST.  I think suppose for argument's sake that the first few operations clear at a rate of 6 basis points, so 1 above.  That might suggest that there is to have people move from overnight that premium would need to be paid in order to induce switching between the really can't see why, though.  I mean, we set overnight rates, and this for decades.  The term structure of interest rates-the one-month, the threerate-is what it is.  Why would it matter? MR. LACKER.  I we've done month commercial paper

yesterday, if we decided to lift the overnight RRP cap size, you wouldn't necessarily need that substitution.  But there was also a discussion that you would want that cap to be temporarily increased, and afterward you may you would need to pay for that substitution.  If it was very low, that with other exit strategies. MS. LOGAN.  From the discussion to a larger to the effect decide you want to bring that down and move some of that overnight into term.  It may be useful to know what premium might affect the exit strategy that Governor Tarullo discussed yesterday, and I think we would come back

Is it a matter of our budgetary cost for this that might affect our choice seems second order for monetary policy. MR. LACKER. here?  That

DUDLEY.  President Lacker, I think my sense of it is that if you that associated with VICE CHAIRMAN thought that term RRPs had a somewhat lower financial-stability risk than

January 27-28, 2015

much that benefit cost you RRPs have financial-stability cost than overnight RRPs, then that sort of argument is moot. overnight RRPs-so let's posit that-then you'd want to know how in terms of paying a higher premium.  Now, if you don't accept the premise that term a lower that, it seems hard to difference in monetary cost between a few basis points is going to be material to MR. LACKER.  Well, I would question that.  But even if you grant swallow that the the Committee in that situation, given what we're thinking about.

If we can get a lot of bit above the overnight RRP rate, then we're not really disturbing MR. POTTER.  President Lacker, maybe we can flip it a little bit. substitution at or just a little the term rates that you're talking about.  If, to get that substitution, we really have to jack it up over the overnight RRP rate, then we are affecting other term markets indirectly.

how do you know that?  That depends on what those other term MR. LACKER.  But markets are, not where the one-week is relative to the overnight.  That depends on how other term rates move, right?

a bit above the overnight RRP rate, because we are setting that at the bottom MR. POTTER.  It does, and we would expect in the configuration rates that we have that they would be quite of the range.

unpersuasive. MR. LACKER.  That's

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Fisher.

a as possible, inform the Desk and helps them, as I said earlier, 'get their muscle tone,' these are see why we would not-it's really a question of, is this a useful exercise practitioner?  We don't want to muck this thing up.  You can debate this MR. FISHER.  I don't want to belabor this point, but, again, just thinking as practitioner, and given the fact that we want to have as many 'bullets in our holster' if this helps small exercises.  I don't from the standpoint of a

January 27-28, 2015

to execute the policy this Committee instructs them to do.  That's the way I would at it. from that standpoint, President Lacker, I'm sympathetic, but it's really giving them the tools that they need look

Chair, I respectfully disagree.  They have this.  They've got plenty of job things.  They know what they're doing.  I'm highly confident they don't MR. LACKER.  Now, if I could, Madam testing platforms.  They can run their own auctions internally; they can run their own simulated auctions.  I've seen them do this.  I've participated in things like muscle tone.  They are a well-exercised crew, a very professional crew.  They do an excellent of executing on these need more market practice.

I think, ought to be that we have seen that the more testing we market participants think these are going to be permanent features of the financial As well as we try to communicate that these are only tests, for some reason market these are just temporary The financial-stability concern has always struck me as baffling.  The idea is there are runs out there that are being prevented now only because of a lack of an overnight facility that people would be attracted to putting their money into.  We would have had The broad concern here, do, the more landscape. expectations run ahead of the Committee's intended communication that tests of a facility. that RRP more runs in 2008 if we had an overnight RRP facility available for people to run to.

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I don't think that's the argument.

MR. LACKER.  Well, then, explain it to me.

DUDLEY.  I think the argument is more that if you have a facility an elastic facility, it can cause private-sector rates to go up by more.  In the old regime, increased, that caused asset to fall dramatically.  If you have an elastic facility, the price doesn't fall, VICE CHAIRMAN that is you had a fixed supply of the safe asset.  When the demand for that asset the rate on that

January 27-28, 2015

I think there is a fundamental difference in and that pushes up private-sector yields by more.  So terms of having an elastic facility.

it's not the probability of the run.  It's if a run starts, if you have imperfectly elastic supply, it can make the effect of that run on the real trying to be careful in considering the cap and other there are certain events that could happen in which you do get a run, and the worse for the real economy. MR. POTTER.  I think something like this economy worse.  That's why we really were issues.  But existence of the overnight RRP facility would make the outcome

DUDLEY.  It's not the probability of the run that's changing, it's the VICE CHAIRMAN consequence of the run.  In terms of financial market conditions, that's the difference.

We're talking about the interval of time between such a run and the time the Federal Open Market Committee, using modern communications, is able to convene and an offsetting change in interest rate policy, which we generally do.  That seems, to me, MR. LACKER. that execute like a fairly minor consideration.

Chair. MR. FISHER.  I think you've heard point and counterpoint, Madam

We did have a show of hands on this yesterday, and the is no to use term RRPs outside quarter-end as part of our all.  We are just looking to test it. March quarter-end.  All in favor, say 'Aye.'  [Chorus of ayes]  Any opposed? CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay. takeaway for me was that most people actually favor both kinds of testing.  Of course, there commitment at this point, President Lacker, program.  That's certainly not something we have decided at We need votes on both of these.  I suggest we start with a vote on option 1, to test term RRPs over

MR. LACKER.  Yes, I'm opposed.

For the March quarter-end? CHAIR YELLEN.

MR. LACKER.  Yes.

January 27-28, 2015

MR. FISHER.  This is versus option 2?

YELLEN.  We're going to take both separately.  We just voted on option 1.

add my vote to option 1.  I apologize. CHAIR MR. FISHER.  I

Let's go to option 2 now, which is to test the term RRPs in in favor?  [Show of hands]  Any opposed? CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay. small operations in February and March.  All MR. LACKER.  I'm opposed.

MR. FISHER.  I'm opposed.

the Desk has authorization.  I guess what you call things, and we've approved both of them. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  I think option 2 includes both of these

Just to be clear, among voters it would be nine-to-one in favor of both. MR. LUECKE.

Now we have got a lot of business to do this morning.  Our and pace of tightening, and I do think we'll be talking really about and hope is that that discussion can be reasonably short because we'll a bit of policy-related comments in this go-round.  President Evans. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay. next topic is timing of liftoff the policy decisions we face in this round.  You remember we will also have to discuss our actual statement, but my guess cover quite minutes get the policy discussion for the minutes would also be based on the the same arguments? MR. EVANS.  If I can just ask a procedural question, in terms of how the constructed, in the past it's been based on the discussion that takes place with regard to the alternatives.  Is it possible that liftoff discussion, and we wouldn't have to repeat

CHAIR YELLEN.  I think so.

January 27-28, 2015

The plan is that, as has been the case on occasion in prior meetings, there would be a separate summary of this coming go-round perhaps under a heading like MR. LAUBACH. that 'Policy Planning,' and that will, of course, summarize comments from participants.

As the memo noted, alternative benchmark policies that incorporate policy, imply a smaller initial tightening and a more gradual tightening than do the noninertial Taylor (1993 and 1999) rules.

As the memo also notes, however, adopting a it could undesirably large increase in inflation or undermine financial stability. Another point highlighted in the memo is that your December SEP paths for the federal funds rate differ appreciably from the path implied by the noninertial Taylor (1999) rule.  These deviations, which diminish notably over the projection period, may suggest that you have a preference for interest rate smoothing.  Alternatively, they may indicate that your views concerning appropriate policy are influenced by factors that incline you to take a cautious approach to normalizing the monetary policy.  For somewhat fragile, on the grounds that the pickup in economic growth is so recent, or you may fear that an adverse shock could prompt serious and hiring, with attendant financial instability.  Containing these risks might be a particular concern for the Committee because rates and the already-elevated size of the balance sheet could limit the Federal Reserve's flexibility in responding to negative shocks.  In addition, some of you may see potential advantages of the natural rate for a time; these advantages might include speeding the percent inflation, or supply-side cautious approach to tightening could be costly if taken too far, because generate an of the FRB/US model of two alternative policy find that-provided that the data-dependent nature of Federal Reserve the two strategies importance, as measured by a policymaker loss function, under most is associated with prospective costs:  An earlier-and-gradual of returning to the effective lower bound, while a raises the probability that policymakers might have to raise Another memo to the Committee, from de Groot, Gagnon, and Tetlow, considers evidence from stochastic simulations strategies:  an 'earlier and gradual' firming strategy and a 'later and steep' strategy.

Each strategy strategy entails a higher probability later-and-steep strategy the federal funds rate very rapidly.

memos discuss what can be learned from prior tightening episodes. Meade, Nozawa, Petrasek, and Zickler, discusses FOMC that occurred around the initial tightening of monetary policy in 1994, Two staff One of these memos, by deliberations 1999, and 2004.  It shows that, in all cases, the decisions to tighten monetary policy were data dependent and forward looking.  Expansion of the Federal Reserve's

In all cases, to possible instances in which the tightening was premature or making their decisions to raise rates.  In both of reversed and the policy rate returned the firming was gradual macroeconomic conditions. communications tools likely left financial markets better prepared for policy firming in 1999 and 2004 than they were in 1994, when the market reaction to the initial tightening was sizable.  The second of these memos, by De Wood, reviews the international experience with raising policy rates from the effective lower bound.  Central banks differed in the precise signaled their intention to transition from the effective-lower-bound policy; however, a common feature was that they provided broad guidance about the economic conditions regardless of communications strategy, policy firming did not prove disruptive financial markets.  In addition, no case was found in which policy firming was too late or otherwise insufficient.  Among the episodes considered, Japan in 2000 and Sweden in 2010 provide excessive, perhaps because policymakers gave undue weight to factors other than inflation and economic activity when these instances, policy firming was subsequently to the effective lower bound.  Canada, in contrast, had a more orderly experience when it tightened policy starting in 2010, perhaps because and was closely keyed to the time at which policy firming is commenced.  In addition, the final my memo with Kiley and Reifschneider noted two points that the Focusing specifically on communications, the memo by English, Laubach, and Reeve offers language-reproduced on the third and fourth pages of your handoutthat the Committee might consider employing in policy statements as it approaches and reaches section of Committee might wish to highlight in speeches, testimony, and other forums:

One:  Once firming commences, the federal funds rate will not follow a predetermined trajectory; instead, all adjustments activity could turn out to be stronger and inflation higher than than envisioned in weaker, making it to tighten more slowly or even to reverse course. Two:  Real expected, implying that policy would need to tighten more rapidly the SEP paths.  Conversely, conditions could turn out to be appropriate

lower the likelihood that the Committee lower bound-were playing an important role in Furthermore, policymakers might come to a consensus that special considerations-for example, a desire to would need to return to the effective its deliberations.  If so, the Committee might wish to describe these considerations in its policy communications.

These memos are excellent, reading them and found them very interesting.  One of the things that I the set of the memos is it begins affects the economy.  I applaud that.

statement is to repeat over and over again the believe that our large balance sheet continues to provide accommodation to the they might otherwise be.  If I think I think about calibrating the stance of policy going forward, how do I Committee think about, the existence of a large balance and the way it perhaps-may or may not, depending on the staff's views-influences how the pace of tightening or the level of tightening at any point in time?  How do these interact, and how should we think about them? One of the things that we do in our current fact that we economy in one form or another, and that, in particular, it's presumably keeping financial conditions or interest rates at the longer term lower than about accommodation and take into account, or how should the sheet we calibrate two things

E. NELSON.  Well, the elevated balance sheet, by providing stimulus, makes more favorable for economic expansion and for inflation to return to 2 percent than in the decisions concerning the target range strategy. MR. conditions otherwise, and in that sense it's a conditioning factor for the federal funds rate.  That's one way of thinking about how that separate monetary policy instrument fits into the overall

In the baseline funds rate as the active tool of monetary policy that's governed by the conditions that are specified in question. effect of the size of the portfolio on providing a projection, we treat the monetary policy rule, but in the background, under the set of Tealbook B, the size of the portfolio is evolving, is melting away, and with that the downward pressure on term premiums is diminishing as well.  That may go part way toward providing some help on the rate path-steeper, higher, lower-I'm a little bit confused about how I make some arguments about why we think the path ought or higher than it otherwise might choose to be.  I'm trying to figure out how I think path versus another. MR. PLOSSER.  But if I, as a policymaker, were trying to think about how do I set the right level of the interest think about the effect of the balance sheet.  Unless I'm just going to follow a rule and we're going be done with it, we're going to to be lower about that as a policymaker to determine whether I like one

WILCOX.  Sure. MR.

My choice of the funds rate in that equilibrium would go up less? MR. PLOSSER. MR. WILCOX.  Absolutely.

much difference that MR. PLOSSER.  But we don't really know, at the margin, how would make.  I guess that's kind of where I was coming from.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota.

Chair.  I apologize to President he's made his positions on policy quite clear.  [Laughter] that David was confused by that, but that's okay. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes.  Thank you, Madam Plosser, but I felt that over the years MR. PLOSSER.  I didn't realize that I understand the treatment of asset purchases, as David Wilcox and Nelson have explained, in the optimal-control exercises.  I find it more difficult to understand rule is supposed to be dictating level of policy is relative to some kind of steady-state normal, and that should include read the memos Taylor (1999) rule,' I these asset in there as well providing stimulus.  I didn't find the framing of the policy decisions of MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I'm going to pick up on the same line of questioning as President Plosser.  I find Ed in the Taylor rule formulations.  It would seem to me that the where the asset purchases as being part of that abnormal provision of stimulus.  When I and was remarking on, 'Boy, we're more accommodative than noninertial thought, well, we're actually a lot more accommodative because we've got all purchases

just think that the Committee in terms of noninertial Taylor (1999) rule as compelling because I we're much more accommodative because of the inclusion of asset purchases.

issue.  I think it's right to be thinking about how accommodative policy can that tightening too early can also lead to associated with that as well.  The memos are very it's important for us as a Committee to keep that in mind. I think Thomas has something he wants to say, but, first, I have one small point on the financial-stability lead to the risk of financial instability, and I encourage us to be doing that.  It is also important, though, to keep in mind, as the memos point out, financial instability, and there are the risks clear on that.  I think

I'm a little afraid little bit like double counting.  The way that monetary FRB/US model is interest rates.  Now, that's how the term-premium effects that we are still and future, longer-term interest rates do reflect these term rule mechanically responds to current conditions, these current will be stronger simply because longer-term interest rates are lower than they would rate if the balance sheet didn't continue to exert downward MR. LAUBACH.  May I quickly respond to President Kocherlakota? that what you laid out might sound a policy transmission largely works both in the staff projection and in the through longer-term assuming, and that are shown toward the end of Tealbook B, figure in.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Evans.

in an environment in which the unemployment rate is still higher than the and inflation over the forecast is underrunning our goal.  You could say it's not really MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  On this topic, there's a completely different way to characterize accommodative policy.  You can do it with regard to whether we're achieving our goals natural rate accommodative enough.

question about the proposed statement on page 2.  The proposed phrase:  'Based on its current assessment, the Committee judges that et cetera, et cetera.  My question basically is whether this an unusual because it's singular, as if there's only one assessment of the Committee.  It point when we are making a decision to change policy, like a future action in a we say 'the Committee's assessment,' I'm wondering, how narrow this going to get into discussions about But it strikes me that, because of the future aspect of this, it the likelihood of that assessment or to use central tendency of that.  I guess my question is, little unusual in its current usage?  It led me to add a different modifier in But at any rate, I have a paragraph 3 includes the economic conditions,' usage of this phrase strikes me that that's not unusual at a taking an action to change the funds rate.  But when we're contemplating couple of meetings and is?  If you don't quite agree with that assessment, then you're the appropriate conditionality. would be better to somehow try to characterize something slightly more probabilistic, the doesn't this sound a my own formulation.

'may' or 'could MR. LAUBACH.  I think the probabilistic aspect of this judgment of a couple of meetings or possibly more ahead is intended to be conveyed through the

January 27-28, 2015

make no bones about the fact that we struggled long and hard to convey potentially.'  But I will just the right sense of the probabilistic nature of the assessment.  Obviously, it would be great to have a better way of doing it.

I know it's wordy, but if you were to say 'median assessment' or 'central or something that indicates there's some element of a range, me that would augment the ability to achieve a an early stage of our planning. MR. EVANS. forecast of the Committee,' however narrow that may be.  It seems to stronger consensus at

YELLEN.  That's very useful.  Thanks.  Governor Fischer, did you have a CHAIR comment?

2010 primarily for financial-stability reasons-they were scared about what was I don't know if there's a there, because we don't have a large sample. MR. FISCHER.  Yes, just two small points.  I think that the Swedes raised the interest rate in happening to housing prices-and they had to backtrack from that later. lesson size of the balance sheet, which is at great length during the next couple of years, is all reflected term premium, can't you do simulations with the premium effect and without the premium and tell us what the effect of reducing the size of the sheet would be at given policy interest rates? David, a question.  If the place in which we reflect the an issue we're going to talk about in the effect and with a smaller premium effect balance

think of a reason why not, off the top of my head.  We ought to to do that. MR. WILCOX.  I can't be able

It's very closely related to the studies concerning the efficacy of asset that we've done in the past because, in effective, those memos also contemplated the MR. LAUBACH. purchases macroeconomic effects of varying the size of the balance sheet.

No, no. MR. LAUBACH.

WILCOX.  I think Thomas's views and mine, as just articulated, are exactly in role that the SOMA portfolio plays, through the size of the term premium MR. alignment about the effect, and how that wears away in the projection.

MR. FISCHER.  Thanks.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lacker.

Fischer's comments.  First, if you do marginal effect of our balance sheet on the term in the current circumstances, for the issues President Plosser and Governor about that is far larger than our uncertainty about other aspects of your policy MR. LACKER.  Two things related to Governor that and if you devote any effort to measures of uncertainty surrounding those projections, I'd urge you to take seriously uncertainty about the premium.  I think Fischer discussed, if we're thinking about the effect of the balance sheet, it strikes me that the uncertainty framework on the effect of short-term interest rates on the economy.

WILCOX.  Yes.  Let me venture a hypothesis, which is a bit risky.  One limit on our that our structure is maybe not literally linear, but is to linear, and, for example, in optimal control, the preferences are literally quadratic. as if they're policy substitutes in your way in which we put the projection together, you could get roughly-I MR. ability to perform this kind of analysis is pretty close The size of the portfolio and the funds rate-and I'm going to look around the room hoping for some confirmation or contradiction-are going to act portfolio.  Because of this don't know whether this would be literally true down to the basis point-the same economic

January 27-28, 2015

trajectory for the funds rate interest rates.  Now, that won't be literally true, because I suspect there are some two going to be substitutes for policy tools.  So it's been our view that, just for the portfolio would be run off. outcome by having a smaller portfolio and a more accommodative path in a way that would be designed to generate, roughly speaking, the same trajectory for longer-term corners of the projection in which short-term interest rates matter separately, but those instruments are simplicity, we'd reduce a two-dimensional situation down to one and give you the choice laid out on the funds-rate dimension alone, given an approach that we thought featured a relatively passive stance with respect to the way that

Would the terms of trade in that substitutionMR. LACKER. MR. WILCOX.  Would be linear.

the term premium, right? MR. LACKER.  But it would depend critically on the marginal effect of a given balance sheet on

WILCOX.  Correct. MR.

If that was like an order of magnitude smaller than sort of your standard MR. LACKER. workforce estimate, that could change the terms of trade fairly dramatically.

WILCOX.  Yes. MR.

MR. LACKER.  I would suspect.

WILCOX.  I would suspect so, too. MR.

MR. LACKER.  Right.  I'm saying if you undertake any efforts to provide estimates of uncertainty surrounding your estimates of the effect of policy on different simulations, include this source of uncertainty because it strikes me as consequential.

Reifschneider, I don't know if you want to add something. MR. WILCOX.  Dave

January 27-28, 2015

Thomas is gesturing to me.  I'm not quite sure what he wants MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. me to say here.  [Laughter]

MR. PLOSSER.  A plea for help.

MR. EVANS.  Something supportive.

effects and, more generally, what will be done to the portfolio in the future are the portfolio, the forecast of its effects on term premiums is just taken from that statement from MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  I would say two things.  First of all, the assumptions on the term-premium based on your actions.  You released guidance about what you intend to do with and basically the Committee.

Wait, wait.  Did we make a statement about the effects on term MR. LACKER. premiums?

You made a statement about what the plan was for the MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  No. portfolio.

MR. LACKER.  Right.

of the term premium effects that the staff has is printed in the back of Tealbook B.  As David said, that basically predetermined path of effect on term premiums on the portfolio is rolled through the forecasting apparatus and I'll call it a passive policy lever to get the forecast.  Now, if, as Governor Fischer me, there's a paper that he and I coauthoredMR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  The analysis done the treated as what was suggesting, the Committee wants to explore alternative paths, you can apply different term premiums to the portfolio, and then we would run the forecasting machinery again.  In addition to that, which I think maybe is why Thomas was gesturing at recently

Why didn't he talk? MR. LACKER.

January 27-28, 2015

Engen, in which we the effectiveness of the Committee's forward guidance and the asset purchases taken was to explore a range of possibilities for the it ranges from having moderate effects-that's our baseline effects and to having quite small effects.  If the Committee much uncertainty they could have on MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  I don't know.  [Laughter]  -with Eric looked at together.  One of the things we did in that paper effectiveness of the policies, and estimate-to having more substantial wants, we could do different assumptions that show how the outlook.

MR. LACKER.  Great.

I should say that we did the analysis looking back.  To go be a simple undertaking.  To do what we did in what signal the market takes from your changes in the major effect on what the potential macroeconomic implications would be. Chip survey data and other things like that to get an With regard to future actions, assessing what we wouldn't know with any certainty whatsoever market expectations would be.  Having to talk about what it might be in the future, as appears to have been over the past six years, makes it a much, much MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  But ahead and do it in terms of what these alternative assumptions would mean for future conditions is starting the exercise up again, and it would not the paper, we would need to decide portfolio for your overall stance of policy, including the funds rate, as you go forward, and that decision would have a In our study, we were able to use Blue estimate of what the market reaction actually was. the market reaction would be pure speculation-well, maybe not pure; I mean, the Desk would have opinions about how it might go.  But what those opposed to analyzing what it more difficult project.

criticism you MR. LACKER.  Got it.  The second thing, very briefly, about Sweden.  I took the juxtaposition of what you described about Canada and Sweden to mean that the

January 27-28, 2015

about Sweden is that they continued to raise rates after they lifted off, not that they lifted Is that correct? raised off at all.

look at various considerations that were in Sweden around the time of their liftoff in 2010, GDP growth was picking up, and that they looked at.  The Taylor rule was starting to move up. people could differ, but it seemed like it wasn't a terrible time to lift off.  I think the on boosting the rate even as the euro crisis started to get worse and core to fall. MR. KAMIN.  Yes, that's right.  If you take a present inflation was near the measure Reasonable issue was that they kept inflation started

CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Brainard.

is just an obvious 'connect the dots,' but it would be useful to in view this potential conundrum that we might see out there in which we're talking but we're not seeing corresponding moves in the long end of the I don't know where it would lead us, and I say this with some trepidation, but I MS. BRAINARD.  This see an analysis of the extent to which we think we actually do have two separate instruments, especially about raising short-term rates yield curve. think it's worth having some analysis of this question.

WILCOX. We'll take a look at that.  I fear that, due to the limits of our knowledge, size of the portfolio has a smaller effect on the term premium, and the to get the kind of real I have in mind.'  That's the sense in which we MR. we're not going to be able to give you an interesting answer because, for example, coming back to Jeff's question, if the policymaker recognizes that, the policymaker is going to say, 'Gee, with a stronger portfolio effect, I need to run a more accommodative funds rate policy in order economic outcomes and inflation outcomes that treat these two policy instruments as linearly substitutable.

January 27-28, 2015

DUDLEY. But, David, it might be interesting to look at how a have the same stance financial-market conditions but with different yield curves under the two regimes. funds rate and a steeper sort of VICE CHAIRMAN different shape of the yield curve affects the economy, because you could with regard to It would just be interesting to know what it would mean to have a lower yield curve versus a higher funds rate a flatter yield curve.  I think that would just be interesting to look at.

If the marginal effect is much smaller, one must reinterpret history.  You MR. LACKER. appreciate that, I'm sure.

Perhaps just one small point on this.  As David highlighted, from the of our models, these tools are very close substitutes.  But you might look at, for tantrum as an episode in which actually market participants may have not complements to the communications about asset purchases actually also conveyed path for the short-term interest rates.  That's hard for us to do.  I mean, we all we can do. MR. LAUBACH. perspective example, the taper understood them to be that way, but in which they thought that they were extent that they thought that the information about the can make ad hoc illustrative assumptions, but that's basically go-round.  We have quite a bit of time call on President Lockhart. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Let's begin the pressure, so I think we should get started.  Let me

Chair.  I expect conditions will make liftoff in a strong preference for erring on the side of little longer rather than taking the risks of moving prematurely.  I am assuming that the actions will be a signaling decision two, possibly one, meeting ahead of liftoff change of statement language, an intervening meeting statement in the case of two decision at the next meeting, and MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam 2015 appropriate.  But, in that context, I have waiting a sequence of involving a meetings ahead that reinforces the high likelihood of a liftoff

January 27-28, 2015

the and there is a development that is obvious justification for pushing the pause a Therefore, from a think the right question is how to weigh the risks of signaling liftoff versus the risks of waiting.  I think an earlier signal would entail significant risks if of that decision is one of little or no evidence of inflation moving back to target, then the decision.  I'm comfortable with this approach.  I do not have great confidence that Committee can preserve a lot of flexibility once the signaling decision has been made communicated, unless button.  I view liftoff as close to fait accompli once the signal is given. timing standpoint, I prematurely the context accompanied by a mixed data picture and higher-than-normal uncertainty.

the second question to, what developments do I need to see in the data signal that a liftoff decision is coming in, say, 90 days?  I am prepared to the absence of clearly affirmative evidence on inflation, as long as is not a troubling accumulation of contrary evidence.  While that is a minimalist take on with this approach, in light of the current apparent strength of ideal to see core inflation readings moving above 1Â½ percent.  I don't most measures of labor compensation.  And, anchored inflation expectations.  I would characterize those criteria As I said, I won't hold out for that degree of data dependency.  At a I'd like to see evidence that the transitory effect of energy-related prices is dissipating. it would be bad 'optics' to signal rate increases in the midst of a string of I'd like to see a reversal of the recent disinflation trend seen in core inflation and less ambiguous I would also adjust in order to be willing to take the first liftoff step in there data dependency, I am comfortable the real economy.  But I can imagine a framework of affirmative evidence-call this my framework.  Ideally, I'd like think a 'run rate' of core inflation below 1Â½ percent is confidence-inspiring.  Ideally, I'd like to see nominal wage growth increasing according to ideally, I'd like to see clearly as affirmative evidence. minimum, I'm concerned that headline inflation reports that are moving away from our longer-term objective. evidence of

January 27-28, 2015

on inflation expectations.  Now, I can imagine real-economy developments that might mitigate my concerns about incoming inflation data.  Data that indicate significant my baseline expectations for GDP and jobs growth would bolster my confidence likely to move in the desired direction.  But I emphasize the word readings substantially overshoot of that inflation is very 'significant' in that qualification.

the evolution of statement language, I support the general approach suggested meetings' as a bit clunky, because it's when it's first used.  Even if in casual usage the expression it will be taken to mean two meetings.  I think the very high. statement to preserve flexibility and remain true to data dependence, I'd an increase in one of the coming meetings.'  If that's too coy, and the Committee wants conditions are likely to a target change at one of the next couple of meetings.'  In that case, keeping 'couple of would view is okay. As regards in the staff memo.  However, I view the phrase 'couple of open to loose or strict interpretation can mean an indefinite small number, I think bar for not following through once we make the language change should, and will, be If we want the signaling prefer something like 'economic conditions might' or 'could soon warrant' or 'may' or 'could warrant to signal the next meeting or the following, I'd prefer saying, 'Economic warrant meetings' I

Finally, I do not favor dropping the 'balanced approach' Concerns about the combination of high unemployment and high inflation have diminished, but that concern has been replaced, in my thinking, with a significant of unemployment below quite possible we will still face some tension in our dual mandate, so I would keep the approach'

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Rosengren. CHAIR

January 27-28, 2015

with questions that was posed to us. MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My comments are quite consistent President Lockhart's.  I'm going to answer each of the three question 1, the risks at liftoff remain asymmetric.  We have the ability to raise shortwe are limited in our ability to offset negative shocks, and given my the risks of negative shocks from abroad are elevated, I would rather wait longer and, if quickly we would reach both disinflation in developed economies adds further to For term rates more quickly, but we do not have the ability to reduce short-term rates below the zero bound.  Thus, as long as view that needed, tighten faster should we have underestimated how elements of our dual mandate.  The global the risks of significantly undershooting our inflation goal-the one goal for which we set an explicit target.

question 2, I agree with the Chair's assessment that, before we lift off, we reasonably confident that inflation will be moving up over time.  Being reasonably that we have tangible evidence that wages and/or prices are moving in a goal for inflation within a reasonable horizon.  Thus, I have been consistently am I comforted that inflation surveys market indicators are signaling disinflationary concerns tightening labor markets.  I would be strong evidence in disaggregated wage and price data that tighter labor markets are starting to frame. In terms of need to be confident would require way to ensure reaching our 2 percent would be careful not to rely too much on forecasts based on models that overly optimistic about our return to our inflation goal, nor are not falling when a wide variety of and have been doing so since October despite uncomfortable removing accommodation before we see core inflation rising rather than falling, or move wages and prices in a way consistent with reaching our inflation goal within a two-year time

[Laughter]  I'm going to address each of the questions posed to the Committee.  Regarding how the FOMC should weigh the risk of lifting off too soon versus the risk of waiting too long, with economic growth strengthening, full employment approaching, inflation expected to move gradually back to target, and our policy be underestimating the costs of moving too slowly.  The analysis in one of the staff uses the FRB/US with following either an early gradual policy path or a later using models to inform reasonably accurate sense of the costs of lifting off too soon, they may not accurately reflect all the costs of waiting too long.

If we lift off too soon, we'll encounter employment and inflation costs that standard models reasonably capture.  Although the zero lower bound may exacerbate these costs, our models are sophisticated enough to provide some help in judging these costs.  If we wait too long to lift off, there may be benefits from avoiding future episodes of the zero lower bound-benefits

Our models aren't sophisticated enough to calibrate those costs and risks, yet we know from the crisis that the costs can be In addition, there may be value in initially moving rates up gradually.

But that's that as a problem. Although the Committee has been appropriately cautious up to now, I'm in view of expansion.  Monetary policy will still be highly accommodative after the first That's not to say that after we start raising rates we will necessarily continue on a predetermined path up.  The future is always uncertain; negative shocks can hit the economy at any time.  If incoming economic information materially changes our outlook, we would change our policy.

However, it is particularly important, as exhibited in Canada, the policy be data driven, as President Mester was suggesting.  Further, the models do not to any serious economic consequences in the event that the policy rate needs to return to is data driven, as indicated by the staff's consideration of both rules and historical experience, we should be lifting off immediately, as has been pointed Given my view of the underlying strength of the of our financial the memo on foreign experiences point out that point the zero bound.  With a policy that various out earlier.

there will be less of a need to raise the funds aggressively in the future.  Indeed, an earlier liftoff does more to ensure that we can be liftoff than does continued delay.  The fly in the ointment, of course, is the rapid the subsequent effects they will have on headline and, to some extent, for the Committee, and I think it increases the danger that we will fail to see an the oil price decline. More immediate liftoff also indicates that rate patient after decline in oil prices and core inflation in the months to come.  These effects will make policy deliberations unusually challenging underlying firming in inflation, and in so doing delay normalization by more than would occur absent true that by waiting until the smoke clears, the Committee can offset nominal rates at a faster pace.  That is easy for us to say now.  When the time a certain outcome of policy in the financial-stability go-round This risk, I fear, concerns me and is one that is not captured in the model exercises. It is pressures by raising interest comes, doing so could be politically difficult and far from deliberations.  Governor Tarullo gave a great case for this yesterday.

It only justifies more accommodative rates than usual. prices pressures.  For that reason, I would place more weight, as trimmed pressures.

Or, if those variables would not call for a gradual approach, the specific

MR. EVANS. 10   Thank you, Madam analogy, I feel a little bit the channel meetings, I have already voiced my position regarding the first question on that we should remain patient for some time before initiating premature policy tightening.  If the and then the economy is hit with a extremely uncomfortable unconventional policies, but this time it would be in the context of a policy reversal.  The what it takes to achieve maximum employment and price stability. For several weighing the risks of lifting off prematurely versus waiting too long to raise rates.  For me, prudent risk management dictates our policy liftoff.  One of the biggest risks we face today is a Committee misjudges the strength of current conditions disinflationary shock soon after liftoff, we could find ourselves in the position of being forced back to the zero lower bound.  We would again have to turn to secondbest most powerful of these unconventional policies is our credible expression in support of policy actions that we will do Returning to the zero lower bound would be a large blow to our credibility.  This would reduce our future ability to provide stimulus through such guidance.

I don't is no great cost if we end up, for a period of time, with inflation running margin, moderate increases in interest rates.  Our tools are scenarios in the Tealbook showed that. In contrast, what if we wait too long and inflation picks up faster than we expect? see a high cost to this scenario.  We have far to go to reach our inflation target.  Some greaterthan-expected pickup in inflation would be welcomed to speed this policy achievement. Furthermore, there moderately above 2 percent.  If inflation did overshoot our target by an uncomfortable we know how to address this problem with powerful instruments in that event.  The alternative

January 27-28, 2015

turn to the economic conditions I would have to see to justify liftoff.  I I circulated earlier.  I think if you look at that, it shows a great deal of data dependence, lot about desiring.  First, economic growth would not only in a point forecast that inflation would get back up to 2 percent within two also that once inflation rose to 2 percent, the odds of inflation running modestly above equal.  That is, I want to be confident that we have put a target in a sustainable and symmetric fashion. Now let me mentioned these in December, too.  I have tried to capture these with some suggested language that which is something that we all talk quite a have to continue to run at a solid pace.  On the inflation side, I would need to have good confidence years, but or modestly below 2 percent were policy in place that is designed to achieve our to me much too timid if we adopt an assessment that is hoping to thread risking crossing over time of liftoff, I would like to see clear signs that nominal wages 3 to 4 percent growth range that I associate with neutral cost increases that would be more consistent with an underlying inflation rate percent.  I would also expect to see at least the beginnings of an increase in year-over-year lot with President Lockhart's suggestion that if we're below on core that is not encouraging.

'in a couple of meetings' raise rates in two meetings?  As it stands, I think the answer is, 'Not the suggested language didn't make more reference to these data issues I find only small comfort in the language that allows for a delay in the rate hike if we progress on inflation.  This puts an ill-defined marker down the task of proving that the outlook has turned worse we have enough growing increase.  I circulated provides a more explicit conditional set of inflation indicators.  It seems to say we don't have enough just the path for Now, let me turn to the suggested language.  I look at the wording in the proposed pre-liftoff statement and ask myself, is it plausible to have this language in place and then not really.'  That would present a high hurdle for my agreement to adopt such language.  I was disappointed that directly. see slower-than-currently-expected today, and then, to trigger a delay, it assigns than this marker.  Instead, the onus should be on proving that confidence in our forecast of increasing inflation to justify the rate suggested language that important for us to affirm the need for the policy tightening, not just evidence for a delay.  Being confident that inflation is sustainably headed back to 2 percent seems to be good policymaking under uncertainty.  We are highly uncertain about inflation, and we currently are well below our inflation target.  Continuing a patient monitoring for signs that inflation will increase over the next two years still seems prudent.

Indeed, given the evolution of the we have been more patient than suggested by many simple monetary not directly taken into account by these associated with the zero lower bound. the Now, as suggested by my own research earlier with Dave Reifschneider, there are conditions that warrant economy, it's clear that policy rules, and even the optimal-control simulation reported in the Tealbook.  That patience has been partly guided by several factors that are approaches, especially the possible future downside risks Yet I think it's important to remember that 'lower for longer' does not mean forever.  Even accounting for the reasons to be very patient, we are nearing conditions that would warrant start of normalization of our policy, in my view.

But inflation would still be well In weighing when to lift goals.  If we lift employment part of our below our 2 percent goal.  Even after liftoff, we can manage the pace of normalization to make sure that inflation moves back to target.  Our continuing extraordinarily accommodative policy

Again, I think it's about liftoff just to remind ourselves how extraordinarily accommodative basically going to repeat what President rates, but also a of more than $4 trillion that is providing substantial stimulus, at least based on the on the effects of LSAPs. stance, coupled with a expectations, and the time-honored lags in monetary policy, make it return to our 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Of differently, but to lose confidence in that basic forecast, I would need to see a serious slowdown in economic growth or clear signs important in thinking the stance on monetary policy is today.

But meeting I referred to similarly agnostic or I'm not convinced for several reasons is too concern to me include a speed effect, whereby inflation responds to the change in as well as its level.

in policy rules, such as that built into the Tealbook hoc inertia perpetuates past policy errors.  If you'll forgive me for saying so, it's a inertia too-large unexpected in rates or possibly policymakers' desires to offset past inflation target misses. weighted average of expected future, current, and past inflation rates, current inflation.  The burden of proof needs to be especially high when the course of expedient road.  It's tempting to say that we can be too accommodative.  It's tempting to leave Market Committee.  We save ourselves a lot of criticism short run if we downplay the risks attached to keeping policy longer.  My only advice-this is highly didactic and will probably these temptations at this table.  We need to be what Ken Rogoff least lean in that direction. I'm not a big fan of ad hoc inertia baseline policy prescription.  Post-liftoff, the baseline path is from the Taylor (1999) rule with inertia.  Ad very crude way of trying to capture effects that are more fundamental effects than genuine effects-especially the potential disruption to financial markets from movements Policy may respond to a not just action being advocated happens to be an easy or clean up after ourselves later if policy turns out to that hard work to a future Federal Open and political grief in the exceptionally accommodative be ignored-is we need to resist calls conservative central bankers or at number seven on the stochastic implications of alternative strategies for the later and steep policy strategy.  It's possible-indeed, I would say it's even likely, of my background as a market operator-that the public will interpret a decision to that the Committee is generally dovish and disinclined to raise rates other words, I think there's a risk that the public and the markets might see the 'earlier and gradual' and 'later and gradual' rather than between 'earlier and and 'later and steep.'  If we lift off in March 2015, as I had suggested, or April 2015, As regards memo the beginning of policy normalization, I'm very much concerned about the credibility problems attached to on the basis defer a liftoff as a signal quickly.

On the other hand, my gut tells me if you are going to say you are going to defer liftoff, say, to September or January of the then plan to raise rates quickly thereafter, people will have to wait until is quickly which is apparently not going to happen, people would be able to see as you're serious about 'gradual' and 'earlier and that following year, but January 2016 or March 2016 to know whether you're serious.

We've heard a lot about that around the that and give more also pay nearly as little attention to What I would want to see is evidence that households and professional forecasters toward target fairly promptly over time.  I'd like to see their 5-year consistent with the 2 percent inflation rate, and their 10-year percent evidence the economy is likely to continue to expand at a rate I'm taking into account not only the we see in the economy, but also the anecdotal evidence we pick up from our With regard to the question as to what you would pay attention to in terms of information, personally, I would pay give a very strong nod to the table.

There's been a lot of discussion, and I think of Governor Brainard's

the memory of Wassily Leontief, from I took a course in 1969.  By the way, he was a charming teacher.  He was wrong, but he fixed-income instruments are high.  And one factor that is that it just may be that there's too much liquidity chasing too few in mind.  We're not the only source of liquidity.  I have talked about this before, system. I was grateful that Governor Fischer recalled whom was a charming, charming teacher.  But he did have one rule, which is, 'Keep things simple.' Low interest rates mean that the price of I think we need to consider fixed-income options, and to me that's the simplest, most common-sense explanation.  I think we need to bear that and I would assign a multiple of, say, 5 to the amount of liquidity floating around the That may be one explanation for these very low nominal rates, in addition to the money that comes here because of low nominal rates elsewhere.

think less than ideal in that it provides minimal guidance on how liftoff plans will respond to economic developments.  At this point, Committee's time is probably better spent exploring and debating the post-liftoff liftoff itself.  Again, I want to repeat very much always to see a decision-tree analysis.

January 27-28, 2015

Madam Chair, I've noticed while I've sat around this table that we seem to be very progression proposed in the memo an improvement on the draft this memo.  You may recall, Madam Chair, that Evan Koenig and I have provided to Chairman Bernanke during the transition as to how we might accomplish what is a good time to clean endorse that, and I would suggest that we look carefully at what she suggested.  As President Evans's memo, building on the suggestion of Presidents Bullard, Williams, and I do especially appreciate the reference to the trimmed-mean index.  That's one more practice, resistant to changes in calendar guidance.  That said, the basic is acceptable.  I'd make two qualifications.  First, I like the admirably clear and precise organization language proposed by President Mester.  I think it's language of language President Mester has proposed, and President Williams just said this things up.  I to Plosser, advocate for including that as an indicator.

in alternative C whether the phrase warrant an increase in the target range for the in a couple of meetings' will be appropriate in the meeting that precedes biases, I like President Lockhart's 'couple of,' even though I lost the as we get to the meeting before, it's language to perhaps say 'increase in the target range for the next couple of meetings.'  That gives you a little bit of leeway.  Thank Second, I wonder with regard to specific language 'economic conditions [may/could potentially] federal funds rate liftoff.  Actually, given my argument.  You're indicating in two meetings, literally.  But likely we would want to change that federal funds within the you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bullard. CHAIR

and I just want to say at the outset that I agree comments that we've already waited a long time.  I think we're past the MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have three remarks.  First, I'll talk about premature normalization versus waiting too long, with President George's

January 27-28, 2015

discussing strategy on this.  We're already in the phase of having waited a long characterizations of policy rules that the staff has outlined. talk about what developments will give me pause, and here I'm going to talk about talk about language issues, and generally why I may be wrong, and here I'll echo some of the just made, and in that part of my remarks I have an exciting and zebras' analogy that you can look forward to.  [Laughter] stage of just time, at least according to ordinary Second, I'll expected inflation and respond to some remarks by Governor Fischer and Presidents Kocherlakota, Evans, and Rosengren.  Third, I'll think the proposed language is okay.  The spirit comments that President Fisher 'lions me talk about premature normalization or waiting 'early and gradual' versus 'later and steeper.'  I may be having a different take on table.  I agree with the staff memo that there are many the same net reduction in accommodation.  In that think there is any issue to be discussed here.  In some sense, it's a poorly that, different paths are actually getting to the same point, might there be taking one path versus the other path. With that excitement in train here, let too long, or this from some people around the different funds rate paths that can deliver sense, I don't really posed question for the Committee.  What the memo said, or the way I understood it, was despite the fact that two some regret

main idea to keep in mind here is that we are tasked with developing a good good policy will depend on the shocks that arrive during zero interest rate policy, so be it. rates somewhat faster than what would have been contemplated ex the shocks that arrived, and you have to run the good monetary shock.  I don't think we should deviate from the good policy based on of information.  In fact, I think the monetary policy, and the path of that the normalization process.  If the shocks drive you back to the If the shocks lead you to raise ante, well, so be it.  Those are policy in response to the what that policy may or may not call for in the future based on the arrival

January 27-28, 2015

what was otherwise judged to be good policy in the first Again, I think this is in some ways a poorly posed question. doing so would be a deviation from place.

a few further remarks on this.  If we lift off, there would always be I don't think that any higher today than it will ever be.  No matter when you lift off, you're as a probability.  I don't see much evidence that it is particularly high right minimum right about now. Let me make just some probability that we'd be forced to return to the zero interest rate policy. that probability is going to face that now.  It's probably low.  In fact, it might be at a would be forced to raise rates quickly in the future is also not there.  President past data that would probably lead us to go in that direction.  But, again, that would happen require a certain arrival of information, and we would have to The probability that we particularly high today.  Of course, that's always a possibility that's out Williams outlined some the chances respond to that information.

communicate poorly, or if we have low credibility with regard to raising rates Here I align comments just now that maybe we don't have that much our SEP forecasts.  But this is a problem of market expectations intentions of the Committee as outlined in the What we should do, if we think that's a problem, is bolster the credibility of our SEP really is what the Committee thinks or, if it's not what the our SEP numbers are. Now, if we abruptly, then that would surprise markets and lead to a lot of market volatility. myself with President Fisher's credibility on that particular dimension.  Arguably, we already have this problem today as markets evidently do not believe on policy being somewhat misaligned with the SEP. paths, either by reinforcing that this Committee thinks, then we should change what rates abruptly, this would be well understood by If we do not have a credibility problem where people don't believe we're going to raise rates, then, should shocks force us to raise

And I don't think they should necessarily be an argument figuring into decisionmaking. markets and would not cause unnaturally high levels of volatility.  So we wouldn't have any special problem associated with that, as long as we didn't have any credibility problem.  The bottom line is good policy has to be shaped by shocks as they arrive.  There is always possibility that these will lead us back to the zero interest rate policy or that they would lead us to abruptly raise rates in probability right current monetary policy elephant in the room is that thinking, we have essentially easy over the next several years. wise is a great question.  Unemployment will now likely fall the next two years.  The past two times mid-2000s, large, tangible, The main issue for the Committee, I think, and really the regardless of how we approach normalization within current already committed to a policy path that will be exceptionally Whether this is good or substantially below our estimates of the natural rate over this happened in the U.S. economy, in the late 1990s and the noticeable asset price bubbles developed.  Both of those were hotly debated around this table. Both ultimately ended in recession.  The second one ended in global macroeconomic disaster. Does the Committee wish to risk a replay of these bubble episodes?

of normalization?  Here I want to simmering argument around the table as to whether it is even a good idea to be said yesterday that he was the zero interest rate policy.  I'm very much aligned with that.  I'm the zero interest rate policy.  If we can normalize, I think we should. What developments give me pause in the wisdom address a thinking about normalization at this point.  Governor Fischer uncomfortable with uncomfortable with low inflation and even a decisive level of attention, on this Presidents Kocherlakota, Rosengren, and Evans eloquently argued that low inflation expectations have to get more attention, or

have, over the past five years, placed heavier emphasis than most on the Committee Kocherlakota, Rosengren, and Evans. decision.  I on inflation and inflation expectations as a key determinant of the direction of policy.  In this sense, I am concerned and I have some sympathy, maybe some substantial sympathy, for the arguments of Presidents the ECB as a case in point.  Some of you know that in the summer of 2013 I went QE was their best option.  At that point, inflation was only and falling.  I talked with policymakers, ECB staff, and financial market a cold reception.  But 18 months later, the ECB has come to a decision inflation and inflation expectations drift cautionary tale for us.  We don't want to ignore this to make excuses for too long of a time.  I am sympathetic to I take to Frankfurt, and I gave a speech that somewhat below target people about this.  I got and has adopted QE.  I think it's probably late.  They let a long way from their objectives.  Now it's going to take quite a few years probably to get inflation back to target in Europe.  That's a problem too long.  We don't want the arguments on this.

low inflation as it exists today cannot rationalize the Â½ percentage point is a lower-thanI understand that the natural rate of interest could low, but, in my mind, that also is not low enough to rationalize the zero interest rate the zero interest rate policy is an emergency measure that no that we have.  Even if we raise rates, it will be to a very low level, 75 basis points, and by conventional metrics we will still be putting one point.  I don't think that we I want to make two points.  First, zero interest rate policy.  A gap in inflation of something on the order of simply not large enough to rationalize a policy rate of zero.  It can rationalize normal policy rate, but not a zero policy rate. also be policy.  The bottom line is that longer fits the given data about 50 basis points or upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations.  That's can rationalize the current policy based on inflation alone.

expectations have declined precipitously in recent quarters.  I am very do not place much signal value on surveys, and I agree with President real-time information on others have, remind you of the Japanese experience, in which of inflation, even though actual a target during that point. Inflation concerned about this.  I Rosengren's characterization of some of the drawbacks of looking at surveys.  They are not, in my view, sufficiently sensitive to incoming information to give us policy judgments.  I would also, as surveys continually said expectations were for normal levels inflation continued to come in at low levels.  They actually didn't have all of these comments about how concerned I am about the decline in having special influence on the TIPS-based is substantial.  This is no ordinary oil price shock. causing a lot of volatility and a lot of repricing in some of it that does not seem totally rational in the context of TIPS markets.  The and settle lower price than what was previously considered normal, then we'll see if measures move up.  If they do, then that will give me confidence.  If credibility really is eroding.  I am anxious to see going to develop in the coming months and quarters. However, despite inflation expectations, I think that the oil shock is measures at this time.  The oil dislocation This is a 50, 60 percent reduction, and it's markets; bottom line is, I want to wait and see for now.  I think when the oil markets shake out down, probably at a the TIPS-based inflation they don't, I'd be worried that the Committee's how that is

is following question to the Committee.  Do we really want to agree with President Lockhart's the beginning of this discussion that once we signal that we are on the road, If My final point is about language suggestions.  I agree with others that the language generally okay, but I would pose the telegraph as directly as we are sometimes suggesting here?  I characterization at we are turning a machine on and it's a fait accompli.  Do we really want to be doing that?

January 27-28, 2015

a lion, and you're hunting the zebra, you may not want to are talking about here. you're on the Serengeti, and you're telegraph your intentions quite as precisely as we table about how to do the tightening process.  I agree with President Williams, who this direction.  You want to eliminate the telegraphing during the at the zero bound.  There has been a lot of talk is may not be the right way to approach the normalization things:  one, keep options open; two, be able to move at keep harping on the issue of the press conference, which I this regard; and, three, seize favorable data and move at that point.  You to have to move when the data are going in the wrong direction.  I think it will send the beginning of the normalization process. My alternative vision for how to do this really involves a change in attitude, I think, around the made comments in normalization process.  Sure, it has been valuable about forward guidance.  But this process.  What I want to do is just three any juncture-and, for this reason, I think remains critical in don't want very mixed signals, especially at

not in Chair. Keep options open.  Be able to move at any juncture.  Seize favorable data.  That's how we want to do this normalization process.  Further moves after that, I think, should also seize on relatively good data coming in, both on the real economy and on inflation and inflation expectations.  I think if we do that, we'll get a smooth ride.  If we try to do it on what looks like more of a calendar basis, there is a risk that we will be moving at times when the data are synch with us, and then people will say, 'Well, I don't understand what the FOMC's reaction function really is.'  Those are my comments.  Thank you, Madam

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota. CHAIR

Chair.  As I have expressed, my thinking a somewhat different place than the basic view that underlies the staff's MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam about policy is at questions.  I'm increasingly concerned about substantial downside risks to the credibility of our

January 27-28, 2015

have expressed concerns about upside risks to the credibility of our target and about the risks to the financial stability.  I want to emphasize that the credibility of our inflation target are actually mirrored already in our because the data no longer are that as definitively as before.  I think my concerns are, as I say, reflected see our biggest policy problem as the credibility of our inflation target.  My the staff's questions will reflect that perspective. inflation target.  Others inflation downside risks to the FOMC statement, in the sense that for a long period of time running up until July of last year, we made reference to inflation expectations being well anchored.  That reference has now disappeared from the opening paragraph of the FOMC statement in a position to support in the evolution of the statement itself.  Given my concerns, I not how to tighten further, but, rather, how to bolster answers to question, there are risks associated both with tightening prematurely and with think that others have covered this ground well. in his Williams emphasized in his, but I look around the table and I don't that will around the table. On the first tightening too late.  On the tightening too late, I We have a tool that we can use.  It takes will, as President Plosser has emphasized comments, and President have any concerns on that dimension.  I see

memo works through the simulations associated with this. I am mainly concerned about is one that was not well addressed in the is one that we don't really understand that much about, as Governor Tarullo is so critical in our formulation of our policy and our thinking about inflation expectations.  It's not really that well modeled.  The main risk that I'm captured we were to lift off against a backdrop of low and/or falling inflation and On the other hand, I think the risks associated with a premature liftoff seem considerably more challenging.  I think the staff But the risk that simulation, and it talked about, something that policy: concerned about, the downside risk to the credibility of our 2 percent target, is not well in those simulations.  If

January 27-28, 2015

a shaped, the messaging that low or falling and inflation also look like that, would surely worsen any existing credibility risk.  I it just seems my thinking about the inflation compensation-I'm afraid I actually heard a number of people basically expressing willingness to do that around the table-I think we would be failing to show resolve to bring inflation back up to our target.  However we think inflation issues are we are willing to tighten policy, even though inflation is compensation measures think the reason to be concerned about this unanchoring to the downside is that extremely challenging for central banks to address this situation.  The recent experiences in Sweden, Japan, and the euro zone just show how difficult it can be for central banks to recover if inflation falls following premature tightening.  That talks through some of first question.

liftoff, I see two liftoff.  I might want to see more than those.  But the data need to be will be or equal to 2 percent within two years.  It would be good for the Committee to be is skepticism about point forecasts.  For me, a point is just a way to summarize a probability distribution.  What I'm trying to say here is that risk of inflation being above 2 percent is at least as large as the risk of inflation being number as a summary of a mass of probabilities.  The is that longer-term market-based inflation In terms of the second question, what data would we need to see at necessary conditions for consistent with the economy meeting the 2 percent inflation objective over a one-to-two-year horizon.  One key sign of that outlook would be a Board staff forecast that inflation greater than able to say in its statement, 'We expect inflation to be greater than or equal to 2 percent within two years.'  If we felt comfortable doing that, I think that would be consistent with the kind of data flow that I'm looking for.  Now, there forecast actually the below 2 percent.  I'm just using that second piece of information I would need to see expectations have to have risen back to their historically normal ranges, and that would give me

There are reasons to think that wage pressures are going to lag as opposed to lead inflation, and there relationship between wages and inflation.  But my two necessary conditions the and President Mester.  I think any time is would be Schulhofer-Wohl, is a former journalist.  I thinking about this issue.  For a lag, as others have noted.  I think our decisionmaking should be relentlessly In terms of language, I echo President Williams a good time to go back to the statement and try to reorganize or restructure it.  My staff glad to be of help on that.  My research director, Sam think that perspective would be helpful to the Committee in myself, one thing I would emphasize is that there is a lot of backward-looking language in the statement-where we have been, how has it influenced policy decisionmaking.  Monetary policy operates with forward looking, and our language should be relentlessly forward looking in the statement. Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lacker. CHAIR

the first question-how the risk of monetary conditions being too accommodative or the real rate below what the evolving needs of the economy too little inflation and real activity.  My sense is that a economic growth is occurring now, and together with the continued MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I view Committee should weigh the risks of lifting off prematurely versus the risks of waiting too long-as an instance of the universal too restrictive.  The former keeps would require and would generate excessively accommodative monetary conditions, and the opposite, too-restrictive policy, generates substantial increase in real

January 27-28, 2015

rising nominal interest rates are warranted.  The public wait until June or so, and inflation expectations remain stable-they too early. tightening of labor markets suggests generally expects us to aren't elevating.  Those two facts suggest to me, although they don't guarantee this, that lifting off in June would not be too late or already that on the stability of virtually every indicator of inflation we have and the fact that the decline in oil prices that seems to have been the major to have bottomed out.  If they threat to our credibility, but until then I think we should remain a June liftoff.  When we lift off I would need to see continued stability in a broad remain like to see core and then rising at that point. Regarding the second question, given the data we have on hand now, I am reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over time.  I'm not certain, but I'm reasonably confident.  I base expectations recent threat to the stability of inflation expectations appears resume falling, they could pose a on track for range of measures of inflation expectations, as opposed to breakevens, in order to reasonably confident that inflation would move back to 2 percent.  I'd also inflation stable

like the idea of dropping the word 'patient' in word meeting.  You took that off the table.  Waiting until one moving-I don't way to say it would make you a liar-would making 'patient' think we're deciding to raise rates in March.  What we're deciding in March if we take 'patient' out is to Regarding the statement language, I March.  President Rosengren argued that we wait until one meeting before liftoff to drop the word 'patient.'  I actually advocated that approach in December when I said that the 'patient' should mean just the next meeting before and then undermine our communications-let's put it that way.  Now a corollary to mean the next two meetings is that we have to decide in March about June, but I think we need to be very clear about what we're deciding in March.  I don't if we take 'patient' out

January 27-28, 2015

June on the table.  In terms of crafting language, that's important to me.  The way I feel rates, I'm attracted to President Mester's language, which says 'Based increase in the target range will be in a couple of meetings.'  Now, I understand that's strong relative to the proposal 'could potentially warrant' or 'may warrant' or 'could cause But, I too high.  I think we should important to Committee on board for dropping 'patient' in March.  I'm flexible enough to be able such more elastic language.  But I'll tell you that if the data evolve the way it looks it will evolve, my sentiments would be more closely aligned with President Mester's leave about policy and raising on its current assessment, the Committee anticipates that an appropriate that's on the table here, which is us to think about,' or whatever.  I mean, it kind of strikes me as on the wishy-washy side. don't think it's a choice in March.  Let me emphasize this.  We're not choosing between starting a countdown and not starting a countdown because that raises the bar be finding language that's suitably contingent and suitably open-ended, if that's getting the to endorse like language.

the and expected progress' better than 'deviations,' because the latter, as President Plosser also prefer her version of conditionality.  It strikes me as more direct and I like other suggestions President Mester made.  I like moving 'reinvestments' to beginning of the policy passage, because it's a key component of our policy stance.  I like 'realized points out, connotes excessive precision about our estimate of the maximum employment objective.  I straightforward.

in these simulations, 'early and gradual' versus 'late and steep,' is we delayed an expected liftoff at a time off, I'm trying to think of what statement we would write In the case in which we delay I think the choice really not a realistic set of options available to us.  If when people were expecting us to lift that would preserve the average expected path of the funds rate.

I agree, in that regard, with Presidents Bullard and faster pace of tightening is really I'd also say I'm not favorably disposed to a laundry list of economic indicators in about that, and I think we should keep our statement at a high level.  Those liftoff, it's hard for me to think of something that doesn't at the same time cause market participants to lower don't think it's a Fisher that counting on being able to make up for delay with a unrealistic. our statement along the lines President Evans suggests.  There's something inevitably clunky and inevitably distracting are my remarks, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman. CHAIR

Chair.  I'm going to take each of the I think the risks are asymmetric in terms of the timing, and the cost of lifting cost of lifting off later and having There are two reasons why I reached that conclusion.  First, if you lift off too early, to reverse course and then you end up back at the zero the zero lower bound is not a good place to be, as our tools are because reversal back to the zero lower bound could prove damaging to our Second, it strikes me in terms of risk diversification later and faster is preferable to least be than expected and you are making your objectives.  I think of the outcome as a lose-win type of off too early, not only are you stuck with your policy away from your objectives.  I think of that VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam questions in turn. off too early and having to reverse course are higher than the to catch up. you increase the risk that you'll have lower bound.  That's bad because limited, and credibility. early-and-slower because, in the former case, any regret about being late should at somewhat mitigated by the fact that the economy is stronger more rapid progress back toward situation.  In the case where you lift mistake, but you also have an economy that is further outcome as more of a lose-lose case.  Now, that all being said, I think this debate doesn't really

January 27-28, 2015

far because I have no idea about whether, when we lift off, we're early and gradual any certainty about that, I just don't think it gets really speak to me that much. get you that or we're late and fast.  Because we don't have us very far.  This question doesn't developments, I would need to be confident about inflation heading back percent objective.  I think, just like everybody else, it's hard to characterize all the that you would have to see.  Obviously, where you are, what you expect in there are several things that are important for me.  First, what happens to labor I think this is important in several respects.  I consider two alternative scenarios months.  First, trends in nominal wage flat or firm.  In that case, there's two inferences from that.  One is that real income solid because inflation will be falling relative to growth in compensation. support continued growth in the economy.  The second is that the decline in actual market-based measures of inflation compensation will not be exerting significant suggest there's not feedback arising from that. a negative development because it would mean not only less real income knock-on effects due to lower inflation and lower inflation compensation wage growth were to decline in the period ahead, that really would In terms of toward our 2 necessary conditions the future, and the degree of confidence you have in that forecast are all very important.  That said, I think compensation? in terms of nominal wage growth over the next few growth stay trends will be quite That will inflation and restraint on the wage-setting process.  That will The second scenario, of course, would be if both wage compensation trends and inflation weaken.  That would be growth, which would have implications for the economic growth outlook, but it would also imply that there were into wages.  If nominal reduce my confidence about inflation trending higher in the future.

important, obviously, is how far away we appear to be from our and other indicators of labor The second thing that's objectives.  This includes what happens to the unemployment rate

January 27-28, 2015

inflation, such as services price inflation, that are exchange value of the dollar. market slack.  Less slack, broadly defined, means I'd be more inclined to lift off.  It also includes what's happening in terms of inflation.  Here I'd look through the transitory factors pushing inflation down and focus more on aspects of less likely to be influenced by oil prices and the important is how fast are we likely to close those gaps?  On the the foreign growth outlook improving or On the inflation side, as I said before, what's happening to wages and inflation outlook?  Right now there is lift off. A third factor that's economic growth side, this would include financial market variables, such as exchange rate value of the dollar and developments abroad.  For example, is not? expectations?  Finally, what are the risks associated with the considerable concern about the outlook for foreign economic growth.  If that subsided, then I'd be more inclined to

to the statement language, I think that what's been proposed is pretty good, with it is it doesn't really fit all the circumstances that we might find ourselves in March.  I can imagine a situation in March in which we think that the probability of moving low, and if we thought the probability of moving in June was quite low, then we language.  I can imagine the second possibility, really sure whether case you'd kind of language that President Williams suggested, that is more open table without committing ourselves.  But we could find ourselves in in a situation in which the economy is doing really well and we're really sure, highly case, the language that was suggested might be I would actually prefer to have language that was With respect but one problem in in June is quite probably would want to stick with the 'patient' under which the probability of moving in June was moderate.  We weren't we wanted to move in June, and we wanted to keep our options open.  I think in that instead want to have the ended-putting it on the March confident that we want to move in June.  In that appropriate, that is, 'a couple of meetings.'

January 27-28, 2015

It seems to me we need to craft language that degree of optionality that we actually want to have.  I would actually suggest that the alternatives.  Then, I think that will be easier to get language actually matches the probability of when we think will actually move.  This also should be a way of making sure we communicate more clearly crafted for the degree of confidence that we have in March, frankly, because I don't want to get into a situation in which we're saying, 'Oh, well, we can't move to this language, because that's going to pre-commit us to June too strongly.' gives us the staff develop a couple of alternatives that map into highly likely we want to move in June, not so likely-I don't know, perhaps two or three the Committee to a consensus if the we to the market.

language we're using now, as Vice Chairman Dudley has just said, March would move in June.  So if we don't send that going to not move before September, and I'll come back to In the be our last opportunity to send a message that we might message, I think we're saying we're that.

in nominal wage growth or both, and the question is, what inflation?  Well, we tend to 'core,' because core leaves things out.  But what core inflation doesn't leave out are the through the prices of other goods.  We also have commodity inflation.  I don't think that looking through the effect of oil and looking What would we want to see?  Well, we'd obviously like to see continuing increases employment and declines in unemployment.  We'd like to see some signs of a return of either inflation or say secondary effects of oil that operate price declines affecting

January 27-28, 2015

a decline that to go away as the oil price stabilizes, wherever it stabilizes, and which could turn around oil price back in the range of $70 per later in the year. at core inflation are the same thing.  We are likely to see a decline in core inflation, is likely rather quickly if, as some people think, we might see the barrel or so is if we relate to core inflation, when do we think we'll very unlikely we're going to see very much by September, unless the price of oil mean that we'd move in December if we're waiting to see core that's what we'd like to that will give us some possibility of changing our mind inflation, let's say, above 1.4 percent.  Now, there's a range of views the Phillips curve exists and has that I believe that it's vertical in the long run, but I believe that a lot more vertical than it has been at rates of unemployment that, until recently, were high The question that I'd like to ask move?  It's turns around, which seems to inflation, say, getting up to 1Â½ percent.  We need to think about whether do or whether we want to craft language on having to have core about whether 1.5 percent is enough.  I, deep down, believe that a negative slope.  I'm not certain it's and inflation very low.

credibility if we have to wait longer than of things about that, but we have to remember that there are issue.  You remember that, in 1994, the FOMC waited.  It added to its it turned out to be right, or at least the former Chairman turned out to be right. a question of whether we're going to be confident that what we do is correct, and I think I think we'll need to weigh what happens to our we now think, and you can say a lot two sides to that credibility because It's there will be some questions about that.

a fully rational set of expectations, I'd like to add a few comments on two issues about the question of early and gradual versus late and steep.  The staff's stochastic simulations show outcomes are very similar.  Well, I'm not absolutely sure of the reasons, but if we are looking at

January 27-28, 2015

must come from the fact that they're looking to future interest rates and future paths because, within two years, the two paths of interest rates converge.  Future think relates to something President Lacker said or somebody down there said. the similarity interest rate interest rate paths will look very alike.  I suppose that's one factor.  The other factor, which is very important, I

[Laughter] MR. LACKER.  I'll take credit if it's a good thing.

the shocks are different in the two cases.  But They run it in such a way that the two policies face the same set of so that, as well as the fact that the expectations are the same, gives a certain policies.  I don't know which is more important.  I suspect that the role of the means, and it's something that I think we need to bear in mind, is that 'gradual.'  We are going to be driven by future shocks, as much in the stochastic simulations are not chosen to be particularly large; heard the Chair say it on some occasions-the argument that we need to stochastic world and that means that forward guidance is going to be a problem, and should forget about it. MR. FISCHER.  Somebody implied that the shocks are the same. shocks, and similarity to the shocks is, and what that we really can't confidently say as anything.  The shocks they're drawn from the history of past shocks.  And I think-and I've heard it said by several people, and I think I've try and get a bit away from forward guidance during this period, which was just made by somebody up there [laughter]-by President Williams-is particularly valid because we are going into a we the direction of making it clear that we will react to events as they statement to this effect-change direction at I think that's very important because it is striking that, of interest rate paths since 1994, there really is a tendency to keep going Now, just building on that, with regard to the statements, I particularly value in the statement that it goes in happen and that we might-and there's an explicit times if the data come in that way. looking at the sequences

driving force in this economy and that it's obvious to everybody.  I that we have a very high weight on not wanting to change direction, and we need to think move ahead from the decision that we make.  I'm sure that my recommendation for a long time in one direction and there are very few reversals.  Maybe that reflects how deeply the business cycle is the suspect about that as we will be-I'm not allowed to talk about that, right?

CHAIR YELLEN.  You can.

MR. TARULLO.  You look discouraged.

my recommendation will be MR. FISCHER.  I am discouraged.  Well, I'll tell you what later.

The the staff memo not as question to us, but instead trying to make us think about what the costs of going too late would be if, ex post, we figured out that we had erred a bit. MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Let me begin by joining President Williams and Vice Chairman question before us is not question is trying to select the best moment to go, and I, at least, read posing that early or too running as persistently below target as it has been, I us having an opportunity to fulfill more the mandate of maximum employment by believe to be continued substantial labor market to further dissipate, but as the dual mandate instructs us to do, making are doing that in that famous Federal Reserve phrase, 'in the context of price In that spirit, I guess I would say that an important going-in position for me is that in the current circumstances, with inflation actually see not prematurely removing accommodation, allowing what I slack in the sure that we stability.'  As I suggested yesterday, I think there is a good argument to be made for the

January 27-28, 2015

had made the very good point that the part time statistic not only suggests that there are people who would like to be number of job holders is lower than it has been historically, suggesting that there is yet another proposition that the natural rate of unemployment is actually lower and perhaps significantly lower than the current rates that many of us have been specifying.  I forgot to mention yesterday that some of the staff in the pre-FOMC briefings for economic reasons working full time and aren't, but if you push behind those numbers you'll see that the multiple dimension of slack there.

'Okay, what's the limiting principle here?'  That allow the further improvement in the labor market to take place?  I don't easy.  I haven't really heard anything today that makes it any easier, although I think, gave a very balanced and fair-minded set of conditions that might look to, which I thought were helpfully supplemented by a number of you, most But, again, being honest with myself, I don't think there are going to be that are going to be particularly convincing to me and probably to many of for those of you who have wanted to raise rates for some time now, and so you're it ought to go up.  Under those be looking for some of the things that many of you have indicated. much guidance I'm giving myself or we're giving one another in dependent, but because the data are not all that predictable and the mix of But even with that predisposition, I have had to ask myself and the Kiley-NelsonReifschneider memo pushed me to ask myself, is, what are the conditions under which we should be lifting off as opposed to why I should be inclined to delay to think it's as he often does, President Lockhart we recently Bill and Stan. particular triggers you, except not going to need any additional trigger to think that circumstances, yes, I'll However, I'm not sure how talking about these things because I suspect, in the end, as with many of the decisions that we reach, they will be data

I don't think the risks of big fiscal all that great right now. Here I have were going to go based on past patterns just because so much has been different.  When President Williams head was, butter.' course, did lead to a bunch of inflation and eventually led to the demise of the Bretton Woods system. stimulus are is, in many respects, is the most important point for addressed, and that is the language.  The reason, for me at least, that the is important is that I had perhaps mistakenly understood the insertion and contemplated language not as flipping the kitchen timer and saying, 'Okay, the egg is done in three minutes,' but instead as meaning that we would collectively have seen meeting, not that we mode of saying two meetings from now it goes up. All of that leads me, actually, to what me, and this, again, is one that President Williams, Vice Chairman Dudley, and Governor Fischer, have all language removal of the 'patient' going to be enough improvement in the economy that we were now close to the more normal circumstance in which federal funds rate actions are potentially on the table at any FOMC are in some strongly presumptive

is right and that markets actually do believe that right now go up.  If that is, indeed, threshold.  How do we avoid getting to I fear that President Lockhart 'patient' comes out and the clock starts and, two meetings later, rates the case, then my threshold for agreeing to the removal of that language is essentially going to be, am I ready to raise rates-which obviously is a higher

January 27-28, 2015

I think there are two complementary ways of doing it.  The first is through the I've just given of what 'patient' would already planned opportunities for the Chair in the month of February to Fischer to period.  It will be a lot of work because I think we're running against this is now going to be something like an automatic move, but I think we have that point? Chair's statements-and Vice Chairman Dudley and Governor Fischer, perhaps, complementing the Chair's statements-that give more of a sense that mean.  I know there are do that and perhaps derivable opportunities for Vice Chairman Dudley and Governor do the same thing in that expectations that to do that.

to make changes in the language language, but from my point of view, the increases in the federal funds rate may be considered beginning in start to say, but basically we're trying to support this notion that we're moving into a normal analytic mode, as opposed to the 'considerable time' mode or the in'patient' mode. The second way, as a number of you have suggested, is from what the staff suggested.  I don't have desideratum would be basically language that said, 'In light of improvements in the economy, the Committee anticipates that the relatively near future.'  But then there's no preset course, and there's data dependency and all the other things that we now between has a beneficial side effect for financial stability, and here's why.  As I said, I previous meeting, or maybe it was the one before, my guess is that when I'm to think it's time to begin liftoff, I'm as likely, and perhaps more likely, to be considerations than fears of price inflation getting substantially target.  On financial stability, I have now a very precise metric for stability considerations and when we should be worried about them.  It of many market participants that-and these are their I think that think, at the actually motivated motivated by financial stability and persistently above thinking about financial basically builds on the observations

January 27-28, 2015

they say.  My very that it's definitely okay to have landing-in-Logan-type winds, and, as President may be okay to have a little bit more bracing, but okay.  What we really don't want is, when you're over the North Atlantic and the comes on and tells the flight attendants to take their seats because-and some of you, I'm when things can, in fact, get out of hand a bit. terms-there's going to be turbulence when you guys move.  That's what precise metric is Rosengren will tell you, there's always wind when you land at Logan.  It landing at O'Hare after a line of storms has passed through, which is a it's still sort of pilot sure, have been through that-that's

I suggested, it's basically saying to of federal funds rate increases is going to be succeeding meeting now that rates are in play-we may not do it's going to be a real discussion at each succeeding meeting.  If so, I think you're going to amount of movement in financial markets because people who have thought that things 'taper tantrum' and rethinking.  People are going to be making going to be a little bit more sensitive to 'Gee, what do you they at the point of doing it now?'  That will entail some measure of de facto think that's a reasonable to pay in order for us to be able, in a macroeconomic sense, to lift off at the right time as strength of the labor Governor Brainard was alluding to yesterday, we may still be worried that or the like. I believe that if we change the language in a way that the world, it's now on the table:  The possibility actively debated at probably each it, but get a fair are more or less a one-way bet, which they had to turn around during the slipped back there, are going to once again be different calculations.  Everybody is think?  Are tightening and a little less accommodation in financial markets.  But I price opposed to at a time when we still may have some uncertainty about the market, when, as further strengthening of the dollar will have a further disinflationary effect, most of the early part is not as precise as it may be, but I really hope that we language, but a very clear and agreed-upon understanding of I realize that can come up with, not just different

January 27-28, 2015

it's a liftoff, but instead we can support the that it just gets things into play and actually will cause what that different language means so that people like myself are not placed in a position of opposing the removal of 'patient' on the grounds that removal of 'patient' on the grounds market participants, as us, to make different kinds of bets and have different kinds of expectations.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Powell. CHAIR

versus 'too late,' I continue the risks of going a meeting too soon are greater than the risks of going a meeting the event-and we are really talking, for the most part, about of a meeting or two-that consideration weighs less and less for me.  My simple inflation expectations and interest rates, at a minimum, haven't sending signals of possibilities of these bad outcomes to see whether we start to see a shrinking deviation from our inflation goal rather in this situation, in which slack is means, ultimately, is that it will be appropriate to MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  On 'too soon' to think that too late.  I think as we get closer to differences model of this situation is as follows.  First, the real economy is eliminating slack at a gallop, and on that path some slack remains, but essentially all of it will be gone by the end of this year, roughly speaking.  Inflation and gotten the memo on that-and it may in fact be that they are bad outcomes.  Policy is in a position to be patient, to see whether materialize, than a growing one.  But policy can't be indefinitely patient being eliminated so quickly.  For me, what that lift off in June or September.

remarked, putting June on the table would mean taking the 'patient' It is, I would likely, and probably significantly less than 50 percent likely, that incoming data that would provide confidence to do that in seven weeks.  In fact, it is Now, as others have language out of the statement at the March meeting, which is seven weeks away. say, not more than 50 percent we will get

January 27-28, 2015

get data that suggests we are still moving further away on inflation expectations or in core inflation. probably equally likely that we will some measures, either in language change in March could potentially is 'likely to kind of thing, I could well be think it's a lot less likely I would be in a position of feeling so confident as to do that at the time of the March conditions are such that the Committee can be patient, and I least domestically and importantly, financial conditions.  I have there would be bubble conditions and things like that, which would suggest than sooner.  I don't see that at all.  Again, I come down on The other problem here is that making that trigger liftoff, because the opposite of 'unlikely to lift off for at least two meetings' lift off in the next two meetings'-specifically, two meetings out.  I'll come back to that language change in a second.  I actually think, if the January and February employment reports are really strong and global conditions settle down and that standing at the June meeting thinking it would be good to lift off now.  I that meeting.  As I said, fortunately, would add to those, frankly, at been concerned that that we should move faster rather June or September.

what I would need to see on inflation.  For me, the really answer the transitory shocks the longer-term anchoring of things may or may not be transient, if the dollar and Now, let me talk for a minute about strength of economic growth and employment is an important indicator, potentially, in giving confidence that inflation will indeed trend back toward our goal.  I can't question about inflation in the abstract.  I would say, as a general matter, I'm concerned about low inflation, but perhaps less so than some, for two reasons.  First, we've got in oil and with regard to the dollar that I don't see as a threat to expectations.  I wouldn't personally be alarmed by small fluctuations in the Michigan survey during this unusual period.  Of course, those oil keep moving.  Second, it would be one thing if these readings were coming in at a time when

January 27-28, 2015

because of that factor. the economy were weakening, instead of at a time when slack is disappearing very quickly.  I feel differently about them think we know enough about the make that a threshold.  On core would distinguish between what I'd like to see and what I would need to see.  Of it moving back up.  Honestly, I think I'd need to see that we've seen in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this to think that those are transitory, and it moving further away from the goal.  In September, I would gets lower for what I would want to see, or need to see, on increasing my confidence that On wages, I would not make that a requirement.  I don't relationship between wages and price inflation to effectively inflation, I course, I'd like to see real evidence of the transitory lows that year are in fact transitory.  We need to have good reasons you certainly would need not to see say that as time passes, the bar inflation.  In other words, as slack disappears, that has to be inflation will, in fact, come up.

think that folks have now put their finger on it would be great to have a technology for changing 'patient' in a way that range of meetings-four or five meetings, a few meetings-rather than just the next think we can work on language that would make it easier to do that in September.  I'll Turning quickly to the statement language:  I the issue, which is gives us a couple of meetings.  If we're lifting off in June, the time to do that would be at the March meeting.  Unfortunately, that makes it even more difficult to lift off in June.  If we don't lift off in June, I save any other comments on the statement.  I think the statement language that we have is quite good, and I think that this point is more important than the other small points I'll make later. Thank you, Madam Chair.

you would, say, in June.  What would be We're back to the quarterly press conference question, are we? MR. BULLARD.  I just have a quick question.  You said you may not feel confident enough in March to remove 'patient,' but maybe wrong with, for instance, removing 'patient' in April and signaling action in August? MR. POWELL. MR. BULLARD.  That's why we have meetings.

given, for purposes press conferences a year and that this is going to be a June a September event, President Bullard.  If we had chosen some time ago to have press MR. POWELL.  No, I realize that.  You're right.  I am taking it as a of this comment, that we have four event or conferences at a bunch of these meetings, it would be a different situation, but we didn't make that choice.

just thwarting decisionmaking around the Committee.  Why dependent. MR. BULLARD.  I think it's are we doing this?  We say it's data

YELLEN.  I am very willing to reconsider the issue of timing of press There are not only pros, there are also operation of the Committee and Committee to be careful and thoughtful, but I am open to doing it.  I think it is CHAIR conferences.  I think we need to take a serious look at it. some cons in terms of how that could affect the dynamics.  I would like something that we need to seriously discuss.

add that, in my is unlikely that seven weeks is going to make a big difference in terms of the right time later.'  I don't think there is that much in question. MR. POWELL.  Madam Chair, before I do give up the floor, I would just view, it to lift off or whether, in hindsight, we would look back and say, 'Wow, I really wish we had lifted off seven weeks earlier or

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lockhart.

Chair.  I thought I'd say something now that I it has been brought up by President Bullard, and then temporary through to think that something has to be done about, effectively, the table.  I think, in this period, we want every MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam planned to say in the policy round, because you responded.  I just was going to suggest that you and the Committee consider a policy of press conferences spanning a period conceivably starting March or April September, with the statement that at that time we would review the need for that frequency of press conferences.  But I continue problem that Governor Powell has put on the combination of one or two meetings to be possible.  That's what I was going to say in the policy round, so I'll say it now.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

We will think about that very carefully.  Governor Brainard. CHAIR YELLEN.  I agree.

to sustain that strength as monetary policy recognition of the asymmetry in our ability to respond to the need for a policy correction; stability risks. MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My own thinking about the timing of liftoff and the pace of tightening thereafter hinges on four considerations: the underlying momentum in the real economy, and its likely ability support is withdrawn; confidence that inflation will move back to our target in the next couple of years; and vigilance about financial the underlying momentum is sufficiently robust to withstand a tightening of monetary policy tightening associated with a strong dollar.  The Tealbook investment through the first half of this year, with above 200,000 per month; consumption increasing by disposable income from lower prices at the pump; a temporary drag from falling On the domestic activity front, at the time of liftoff I expect to see continued evidence that on top of likely ongoing financial forecast of household demand and business employment continuing to grow at or around 4 percent, supported by the gain in real and business fixed investment continuing to advance despite drilling and mining investment would meet those requirements.

to see convincing evidence by the time of liftoff to provide full of the return of inflation to its 2 percent target.  Because of the large influence of the highly unlikely we are going to see signs in the inflation moving back to 2 percent.  So we are probably for some track.  Ideally, I think we would want to see monthly increases in core that have been reached, or, at minimum, to have inflection point has been reached.  It is also critical to be sure that well anchored.  In that regard, I think it will be, at least, necessary We are much less likely confidence recent decline in energy prices on inflation, it is next few quarters of actual headline going to need to rely on a pattern of improvement across a variety of related indicators assurance that we are on inflation moving up from the very low levels some confidence that an inflation expectations remain

January 27-28, 2015

longer-run inflation compensation from current very low levels.  I would also take reassuring of increasing wage pressures, but for reasons that I think have already been would not necessarily expect that to be in train at the time of liftoff. that survey measures remain stable, but I think it would also be encouraging to see some correction in reassurance from some stabilization or even a correction in the value of the dollar that the drag on inflation from declining import prices will begin to wane.  It would, of course, be to see signs discussed, I

very unlikely we are going to have strong confidence in rising We should, I think, anticipate that course as we learn about how the market is responding.  This In this area, I would say my risk assessment is more of Japan in 2000 than it is by the United States in 2004.  I would be very monetary policy will be limited.  In addition, in the current economic environment in support is extremely unlikely and the global economy is exerting very deflationary think it will make it even more difficult for monetary policy to correct for adverse Realistically, I think it's inflation by June, or possibly even by September of this year. we are going to have to make a decision in a highly uncertain environment, and, therefore, to maintain some scope to adjust highlights the asymmetry in our toolkit. animated by the episode concerned to avoid a risk of returning to the zero lower bound shortly after liftoff, when the options for which fiscal pressures, I shocks.

the same risk-management considerations point toward a relatively gradual path of room for adjustment as we learn more about the underlying reaction of markets to policy adjustments.  We to the possible effects on risks to financial stability of both the is, to a large degree, a I think policy initially, in order to leave strength of activity and inflation, and about the will also want to be attentive timing of liftoff and the pace of our adjustment thereafter.  I think this

January 27-28, 2015

requires a high degree of vigilance, especially in light of the puzzles that countervailing risk that we talked about surrounding the decline in longer-term nominal Treasury yields.

extremely useful to have the opportunity at this meeting to deliberate now on the just of monetary policy but also of communications surrounding the policy think we have heard from table for possible liftoff, which I would want to do, providing too much in March paradoxically might actually take June off the table. the option to decide in June, based on data that are available making quite similar to what President table, but I'd leave it to the staff to try to figure out how to introduce enough table. It is likely future path not path.  It's very clear from the memo that communications matter, in many respects, very consequentially, at moments of large inflections in the policy path.  I several people around the table, and I strongly agree, that to the extent we want to keep both June and September on the precision in our forward guidance In particular, I would want to have at that time.  But if we have to pre-commit in March to a couple of meetings in specific, I am guessing that the data we have available in March will preclude at least my comfort with a commitment about June.  I had in mind language that was Williams put on the constructive ambiguity in the language while also putting June and September on the

I also resonated with a comment made by President Plosser.  The description of future policy I think is very difficult to capture in the statement at the timing Unfortunately, I don't think the proposed language achieves what you are setting out was stated earlier, whether we're talking about some plateau, whether In fact, I don't think we're actually giving much it's also an area in which I would staff perhaps provide some additional options.

I think recommend having the

YELLEN.  Well, I'd like to thank everyone for a very thoughtful discussion and facilitate our decisionmaking in the coming a few thoughts of my own to this discussion.  I'd like to start with the start of normalization, mention some factors I CHAIR very useful suggestions pertaining to statement language.  We do have difficult choices ahead of us, and I think today's exchange of views will months and serve to improve our communications.  I know we are running late, but if you don't mind, I'd like to add just conditions that, in my view, would warrant think should influence the subsequent pace of adjustments, and say a bit about communications.

market have improved sufficiently over the past year taking the first step toward normalization could be warranted in the not-too-distant future. it's true that most of the example, if the equilibrium real interest rate is currently near zero, as the model suggests, and if the natural rate of unemployment is 5 percent, which is Taylor (1999) rule currently prescribes a zero federal In my view, conditions in the labor that But I think we need to be careful not to jump the gun.  First of all, while policy benchmarks reported in the Tealbook prescribed lifting off today, the case for an immediate tightening becomes much less clear if one varies the assumptions used to calculate those benchmarks.  For Laubach-Williams my own personal point estimate, then the funds rate.

I'm also wary of the prescriptions of the various policy rules, because these benchmarks don't take adequate account of the many special factors at work in unusual economic environment, including the

For that reason, I continue to anticipate if events develop about in line with the Tealbook projection, with real GDP expanding at a strengthening further, and incoming data that allows us to move up to 2 percent over the next years, then it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate That said, monetary policy operates we judge the economy is headed, not that moderate pace, labor conditions achieve a reasonable degree of confidence that inflation will two or three later this year.

core inflation are still running in the neighborhood of 1Â½ percent at that time, and particularly alert for any incoming inflation will return to 2 percent, in that might suggest that economic growth at home is faltering or conditions are evolving in a manner that could cause growth to slow or Such developments, in my view, would suggest the need to delay liftoff.  We have said that to alter our plans in response to adverse incoming labor market would call that promise into question and reduce As I see it, liftoff could come as soon as the June meeting, even if backward-looking measures of headline inflation is running much lower.  But I intend to be evidence that serves to cast doubt on our projection that addition, of course, to evidence that foreign or financial stall. we intend to be data dependent, and a failure data pertaining to inflation or the our credibility.

All that being said, based on our December SEP submissions, it looks normalization along our only 1Â¼ percentage points per year, on average, through 2017.

Second, on account of of the economy to tighter monetary policy, I see a rationale for proceeding cautiously, so as not to disrupt the expansion.  Third, I recognize that the probability of returning to the zero lower bound after liftoff is quite significant.  As the staff's analysis suggests, one way of risk is to adjust policy gradually in response to changes in slack and inflation, and initially to tighten slowly.  Finally, I see a modest transitory undershoot potential benefits.

It is of low inflation or deflation as associated with weakness, perhaps reflecting As Governor Brainard pointed out yesterday, longer-term Treasury securities payouts in nominal terms premiums would decline.

In light of the concerns that people have had about the bracketed statement in paragraph 2, which may be driven by the fact that in senses the foreign economic outlook has become somewhat more certain, rather in recent months, there is an alternative which seems less likely to be objected to.  Let me say that I think we have to refer to foreign developments somewhere in here.  We did talk about them a great deal yesterday, and so it's just a fact suggestion is starts, 'and readings on financial developments,' and to erase foreign economic outlook in paragraph 2.  It's after 'financial' on line 8 of paragraph 3 to add the words 'and international.'  Thank you.

The expansion is on a solid track, job growth has been especially rapid, and I unemployment rate to reach my estimate of the middle of this year.  Indeed, in view of the momentum in the economy, and the highly accommodative stance of will significantly overshoot full employment next year, even beyond what is already built the Tealbook baseline.

regard I am one of the introduction of the new language in the FOMC statement mind, it was a worry the ECB would not take such a dramatic action that was one of the greatest risks to the ill-timed for us to introduce new language highlighting might Overall, I view the risk to the outlook as balanced, and so in that people who is concerned about the saying that the foreign economic outlook has become somewhat more uncertain.  Since that draft was initially circulated, the ECB has announced a very aggressive asset purchase program that, if anything, reduces uncertainty about the European growth outlook.  To my that foreign outlook.  To me, it would be uncertainty about foreign developments on the heels of the ECB's announcement.  Some

January 27-28, 2015

this statement as implicitly criticizing the ECB's actions.  Therefore, I do favor bracketed terms, both 'domestic' and the 'although' phrase, and I'm fully in misconstrue deleting the support of Governor Fischer's suggestion to put in 'and international' between 'financial' and 'developments' in paragraph 3.  Thank you.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota. CHAIR

Thank you, Madam Chair.  With your indulgence and despite of time, I'm not going to be as brief as some of you would like, in view of what I MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. the pressure think is the importance of the issue before us.

a building desire within the FOMC to lift the federal funds rate off the effective meetings, and in some sense this desire is quite understandable. would be a clear signal to the world that the FOMC has, at long last, been successful in country to normal economic times.  What better indicator of that normality than the markets of 2014?  We have a compelling narrative before us.  Labor improve a lot, economic activity looks strong, and the FOMC is finally able to lift the is a big hole in this narrative that real activity and ignores inflation and the developing significant risks to There is lower bound within the next few Liftoff restoring the strong, improving labor markets federal funds rate off the effective lower bound.  But there focuses exclusively on the credibility of our nominal anchor.

recall, Madam Chair, I dissented from the FOMC's decisions at the past two about the downside risk to inflation expectations, and the intermeeting period, especially the decline in market-based measures served to increase my concerns.  All told, the runs persistently below 2 percent for the next decade.  And the charts that Thomas As you will meetings because of my concerns evolution of the data in the of longer-term inflation compensation, have evidence points to financial market participants putting significant weight on a scenario in which inflation

This firming of policy has taken place against a lack of willingness to defend our inflation target the recent behavior of financial market prices show that market This slide in inflation expectations Since May 2013, through our actions reduced the level backdrop of persistently low inflation and a subdued outlook for inflation.  Our actions have sent a clear, however inadvertent, message about our from below, and I believe that participants have, indeed, received this message.

Unfortunately, history tells us we do not have that if we wait for clear evidence, incontrovertible evidence, we will have waited too trap of low inflation, low inflation expectations, rates that other countries have not been able to escape.  We can't wait to make stuck in this low inflation trap before deciding to act to try to escape it. We cannot be reactive.  In my assessment, the next three likely to be critical ones.  We need to send strong signals through actions Now, what is to be done?  One possibility is June or September liftoff unless we have even more evidence that currently shifted downwards.  Again, this desire to wait, to continue on our path and wait for more evidence is entirely understandable.  It allows us to continue with a very comforting backto-normal narrative luxury of waiting for more information.  The experiences of Japan, Europe, and Sweden all suggest that long.  The whole point is that we need to avoid a and low interest sure that we're actually We have to be proactive with this risk. or four meetings are

What are the costs of a proactive There are two that I see.  First, we could create too many jobs relative to what is falls below We have debated whether such an outcome is actually costly, but I would like to view is about the size of these costs, we can agree that they are ones that to keep expectations well anchored.  Second, there is the possibility that such accommodative instability.  The good news is that the report suggests there are few signs of such risk at this time.  The one thing I don't think we permanently low rate will create a permanently low level of nominal interest rates.  If we get stuck at that will translate into lower nominal interest rates forever.

We certainly have not I am not at all moving in a way that is consistent with attaining MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you very much, Madam Chair.

That to create a lot of instability over the next month and a half.  I think it's meeting's minutes come out.  In the context of oil low, inflation low, and a possible Greek exit, I think it is actually appropriate to say that time.  I would leave the language as written. In terms of the language in mind why the ECB felt like they had to engage in quantitative easing.  They didn't do it early. They didn't to do so.  I think we should keep that in mind, as well as that Greek election is likely going to come to the fore exactly when this prices there's a great deal of foreign uncertainty at this Thank you, Madam Chair.

a tremendous privilege it has been to be a part of this group and to serve on MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Before I give my remarks on policy, I just want to indicate what

January 27-28, 2015

that I've served with over the past eight and a half years has been both rewarding and the highlight of my professional career, and I will forever this Committee.  The seriousness and openness and high degree of professionalism exhibited by everyone enlightening.  I view this service as value both the experience and the friendships that I've made in the process.  Thank you.

now to my policy observations.  I'd like to reiterate my belief that in view of a fairly aggressive policy the results expected to be severe.  But, as I indicated in my earlier risks, and I weigh those risks as being Let me turn the strength of economic activity, policy is overly accommodative at present and likely to remain so going forward.  I think that accommodation will probably require rate path in the future, although I draw some comfort from the staff's memo indicating of that kind of tightening are not comments, such a policy is not without some significant somewhat more significant than some do.

the stance of policy, I find the apparent statement language by markets that some people referred to a couple of heightened volatility, destructive consequences.  Communications problems seemed especially true in our statement.  Our own interpretation and the market's interpretation of that statement to be different.  On the basis of comments in our go-round at previous meetings, I as viewing the change in language of our December statement as who thought it might be a bit more hawkish there was no change in the message.  Market participants, as reflected in the moved out their expectations of liftoff from June toward September.  That is, the In light of the way language has evolved in our statement, the market's to have been a reasonable one, but inconsistent with our SEP. Although I remain concerned about misinterpretation of our times today as very highly problematic and fraught with potential risks of and perhaps previous appear interpreted various members inconsequential or status quo, and even some stressed the fact that futures path, forward curve flattened. interpretation appears

January 27-28, 2015

that the statement has taken on the attributes of Hotel where words check in, but they have a very hard time checking out.  And I think As market participants read our December statement as ruling and, in effect, ruling out any action before June, this, in effect, increased to September or beyond.  To have should think more and carefully about rewriting our statement in a more systematic and data-dependent President Mester has pointed out California, that's a very accurate description. out a first-quarter move the probability that liftoff could easily be delayed even further our intentions misread in this way, I think, should concern us all, and we critically way.

That is, it's time to President Williams, President Kocherlakota, and I, back in 2012, went through an exercise in which we proposed a different way of structuring and writing our statements, and we went so far as over a period of three try to convey that.

I think that inhibits normal decisionmaking on the part of trade off and say, 'Well, we're not going to do it today, but we'll consider it more significantly next time when we have champion of any efforts to get out of that dynamic.

the bracketed phrases referring to overseas conditions in I also do not think that we should put in this 'international developments' in Because that's the policy paragraph, I think it might be interpreted as a reference to Historically, we have not wanted to do that.  I know we're operating on the fly here, today we probably shouldn't do that. I do not think we should include the wake of a largely successful launch of ECB quantitative easing and sovereign debt.  I think this is generally good news for the international economy.  I do not wish the Committee to cast doubt on that. paragraph 3. the dollar. but I would just recommend that for

Thank you, Madam Chair. I agree with something in paragraph 1 that's of a factual nature.  The thing about the dollar is we defer recommend

that would like to drop the language in paragraph 2 around the foreign economic at this point, about the consequence of adding 'international.'  I'll others to decide.  Thank you. MS. GEORGE.

We should continue to monitor developments, inflation developments, about financial market prices regarding inflation compensation. the level of monetary accommodation while we monitor MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As I discussed earlier, I believe that continued patience is core inflation, wages, and market measures of inflation compensation.  I share President Kocherlakota's concerns Because alternative B continues developments like these, I can support alternative B.

to the suggested change in the bracketed language that Governor paragraph 3 in which we've chosen to place it President Bullard's comment about the dollar.  It does seem that, in this context, it's and financial developments, and then we insert 'international I'm quite sympathetic Fischer suggested.  I kind of think the sentence in is a 'holding pattern' sentence.  I take the point that it's hard to get those things out, but that sentence is going to change radically once we finally start to move.  That one doesn't worry me as much as talking about inflation pressures

it might be inferred as meaning the dollar.  I just that as a cautionary note in line with President Bullard.  Thank you, Madam Chair. developments.'  Gosh, that does sound like raise

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lacker. CHAIR

most likely path of policy over coming meetings have not changed much since 11:00 a.m.  I had in there in my original draft.  I think April might not be too soon for liftoff in the I had to put a probability on appropriate liftoff, it wouldn't be zero for April, but I many that the difference between April and June isn't as important much as I'd enjoy seeing you conduct an additional press conference, MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My views on the appropriate December sense that if understand the argument of as the path after liftoff.  As Madam Chair, and I do support President Bullard's suggestion, I don't see one meeting as a reason to dissent.  I can support removing 'patient' from the statement right now.

convincing evidence that inflation expectations have become dislodged or growth outlook is at heightened risk of deteriorating, I doubt very much that in to an appropriate liftoff in June.  I to drop 'patient' in March.  Data could come in differently, but feel.  It would constitute essentially pushing everything back until September, and I are very surprising. But, absent that the real March I'll see any reason for assigning a zero probability doubt I'll find it appropriate not that's how I wouldn't see a rationale for that unless data

Williams, Mester, Plosser, support adding it to paragraph 2.  Paragraph 3 is the wrong place for it suggest we defer it. Regarding foreign economic outlook, I agree with Presidents and Bullard, and I don't for reasons that others have said.  It's about our policy assessment.  I'd support adding it somehow in paragraph 1, but given the hour, I'd

YELLEN.  Okay.  Governor Fischer. CHAIR

January 27-28, 2015

developments to paragraph 3.  I've given a lecture on what closely and kind of ridiculous not to put it in on the grounds that the what they that this says.  I don't see what the problem is in putting it in here. MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support the statement as written, except for moving the reference to international we do about foreign developments, and I've told everybody we actually follow them take them into account as they affect the domestic economy-always emphasized-and as relevant to our mandate.  I think it's Treasury makes decisions on the exchange rate.  Well, good for them, but we look at do, and that's all tried, is we make a in paragraph 1.  We can't statement in paragraph 1.  At least I couldn't find one, and I'm sure a lot of making judgments, way of doing it, and I The problem with putting it in paragraph 1, which is where I also judgment on everything in paragraph 1.  We say it's either good or bad, it's developing this way, it's developing that way, and what would we have said on Europe?  Taking note of recent decisions in Europe, we take heart from the situation.  Well, we don't comment on what other central banks do, and so that was what the problem was with putting it make a purely factual other people tried.  We couldn't find one that would be purely factual and didn't seem to be making a judgment-it would be a favorable judgment, but once you start you're going to end up making judgments in the future.  I didn't find a think it's very difficult to do it.

alternative B.  I will not fall on my sword if we lose, but I and I think it's relevant.  As I listen to the morning news, the dollar and effect on the United States is getting a lot of attention.  I opened a newspaper that I happened all over the front page.  We were the people, apparently, who didn't notice any things.  Well, I don't think that makes a lot of sense. With this change, I support think it belongs in there its to read, and it's of this, because we don't comment on these I think we've got to put it in somewhere.

make one point of interest.  I find it ironic that the dual-mandate central bank many people appear to want, to those simulations that people like, they're ones on inflation in the utility function.  It's interesting that it turns out to be alternative B, Madam Chair. Let me finds the most useful description of its current behavior, which be that of an inflation targeter.  If you look at which put all the weight that way today just because we always thought of inflation targeting as coming from the top and not from the bottom.  Anyway, I support

Thank you.  Governor Tarullo. CHAIR YELLEN.

well.  With the language, I supported putting in something on foreign economic conditions a too high a risk that it's read as a commentary on what the ECB did.  I think they also make a good point insertion of 'international' in paragraph 3.  I don't feel nearly as strongly about that as MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as respect to couple of meetings ago.  I think it would have been a good idea then.  I don't think it's a good idea now, for the reasons that John and Loretta have identified.  There's going to be about the the paragraph 2 language.  I affirmatively support removing the paragraph 2 language.  I'm indifferent as to whether 'international' should be inserted into paragraph 3.  Thank you.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Powell.

paragraph 3 says that we 'will take into labor market conditions,' which are economy, and therefore, I think international developments fits in there without being to me that there's a link to the dollar there at all.  I do think it kind of fits there and add something.  I would be happy to support it. MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  On the international language, I would just point out that this sentence in account a wide range of information, including measures of real obvious doesn't do any harm, and it does

January 27-28, 2015

March, there is some probability, for me, that we will choose to go ahead in two things worth doing.  The the last doesn't work, so I think that's worth talking about.  I think there's less in that for me do think it would be ideal to link it to an SEP publication.  And it's difference in timing is going to make much difference in the end. In terms of March and withdraw 'patient.'  If we don't, then I think there are first is we should consider this idea of having regular press conferences-temporarily and on a nondiscretionary basis.  I think the idea of calling a discretionary press conference at minute just than for others because I unlikely that the couple of thinking of ways to change, in the market's mind, to something that a certainty a great contribution to in March.  Thank you, Madam Chair. The second thing I would say is, if we don't lift off in March, in the next meetings we ought to be gives the Committee more optionality over a period of time and, therefore, converts of liftoff in June into something far less than a certainty.  That would be our path, again assuming we don't lift off

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Brainard. CHAIR

alternative B.  I think it is to acknowledge that the recent data on real activity have been favorable, and so I appropriate to see the stronger description of the labor market and real activity.  I think in there. MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support appropriate think it's the language on inflation compensation is very important, so I'm glad to see that it's it in the statement and having the the dollar appreciation and weakening of foreign economic growth that we materially influenced our forecasts, both through core import prices and export channels.  It's substantial, it's material, it's persistent, and that's even after On this question of how to capture developments in the global economy, I think we have been following a very puzzling pattern of not talking about minutes do all the work.  I think that's the wrong approach to be taking.  If you look at forecasts, the amount of have already seen have through net

January 27-28, 2015

said, it does conditions in the U.S. economy.  I think we should try to capture it from to suggest that uncertainty has increased make a suggestion. That just recognizes the reality that we are facing this adjustment was made to reduce the multiplier.  I think, as Governor Fischer affect our assessment of that perspective.  I also agree that we don't want somehow.  I think we could find a way of doing it in paragraph 2.  Let me We could say, 'While recognizing continued headwinds from the global economy.' doesn't say anything about the ECB's action.  It continued headwinds from the global economy.

also think the Governor Fischer's suggestion of a modification to the subsequent affect our monetary policy deliberations, and I as high sensitivities as anyone in this room as to how we work on international the exchange rate, as I think we should not do.  Thank you. I paragraph is appropriate.  Again, I think it does think I have diplomacy surrounding exchange rates.  I think both modifications are very appropriately cautious and do not directly address

In fact, we established, at the Monetary Policy Institute.  Ben Bernanke announced it Unfortunately, he got the wording wrong.  Called it Globalization Institute which gives to Governor Fischer's point.  I would not have the bracketed in paragraph 2.

With and the outlook abroad still very uncertain, it's not terms of timing, I'm still attached to June have slipped a bit, as in both actual inflation and market-based measures of inflation compensation have more significant. VICE CHAIRMAN inflation running well below our objective time to signal that liftoff is likely at one of the next two meetings.  In inclined toward June rather than later, but my probabilities the declines become

January 27-28, 2015

to keep June on the table, the gap between our own views and what is priced into markets is already quite large, want that gap to grow any larger.  I'm worried, basically, that there's this very large 'Oh, we can't move because the markets will react very, very violently.' good situation to be in-one in which monetary policy is constrained because of our to what we do.  I think we very on the table in terms of market expectations.  In terms of the language, the suggested changes to paragraphs 2 and 3 on the international side. In our public comments, though, I still would very much like because and I don't gap and we'll say, That's not a fears that financial market conditions will react too violently much want to keep June I'm happy to accept let me just, as the Vice Chairman, say a few things about Richard Fisher and contributions to this Committee.  I think it's fair to say, speaking for myself, on everything.  But when we agreed, you were very worthy allies.  When think that your willingness to test and challenge the conventional wisdom was very is something that Chairman Bernanke used to talk a Committee, with individuals of diverse even when I didn't agree with you at times, what you had to me think much harder, and very much contributed greatly to the quality and debate of Thank you both for your service.

I very much appreciate your contributions, as everyone else around this table does, to the Federal Reserve and your commitment to public service.  I valuable, and I think it shows the value-this about a lot-of having a monetary policy set by backgrounds and views.  I know that say made this Committee.

YELLEN.  Okay.  I think the issue we need to decide is how to deal with have two suggestions on the table.  I'll start with Governor Brainard's; with 'while recognizing continued headwinds Let me ask if there is any support for that change as opposed to CHAIR 'international,' and we she suggests replacing the bracketed 'although' from the global economy.'

January 27-28, 2015

Okay.  I'm not seeing a broad range of support.  I know it's late in the adding 'international.' day to be doing this.

in our assessment of the economy.  It will be noticed.  I'm not quite sure word doesn't involve taking a view on whether things taking account of-oil prices, the economic outlook in different parts of the world, geopolitical developments. a sentence that says our assessment of our progress takes into account a lot of different me, it's relatively innocent and could stay there for a long time.  It's not the kind of position of asking, 'What do we do next time we have to modify it in Fischer's suggestion is well within the range, but I certainly did hear concerns about adding anything at this point that would ask for a show of hands.  Who would be in favor of adding Okay.  Then, I think I've heard widespread support to get rid of the bracketed language in paragraph 2-so I propose doing that-and a diversity of views on whether to add 'international' in paragraph 3.  I think my own view on this is that foreign developments are playing a major role how it will be interpreted, but adding that are more or less uncertain.  There are a range of things we're dollar, the global It's in things.  To addition that puts us in a some way?'  At least to my own mind, Governor acceptable focus on international developments or be a change that we would be forced to live with.  I guess what I'm going to do is

'international'?

YELLEN.  I certainly would be supportive. MR. TARULLO.  Madam Chair, you are in favor of it? CHAIR

I feel the same way. MR. TARULLO.  Yes.
