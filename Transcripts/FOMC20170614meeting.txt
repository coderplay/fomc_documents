It's definitely my expectation that we're putting this on autopilot, that a plan after this meeting at the press conference, and once we start the unless we feel that there's been a sufficient deterioration in CHAIR YELLEN. we're going to announce plan, that it's essentially on autopilot, the economic outlook that we would want to consider ceasing reinvestment.

On my reading, the assumption seems to be that will be a lot of information in the press conference but not a change in the statement. MR. POTTER.  I think some people will be surprised, assuming that you go ahead with the plan-it's the next item on the agenda-to see the amount of detail released. is that your next few meetings.

So that's a question we've been thinking about and other been thinking about.  And the big unknown is, if there's does that mean that forward or they move it three or four months forward?

June 13-14, 2017

MS. GEORGE.  Right.

move it three or four months forward, that makes life really approach, as we've thought about it, is not to try to guess going to be rather than think through the policy choices you have here because, as time, there are things that they can be thinking MR. POTTER.  If they complicated if you start a little bit earlier, because then are they going to keep on doing something like that?  But I think our what that's Lorie pointed out, as long as the Treasury has through.

DUDLEY.  I think one problem with going earlier-in July-is, VICE CHAIRMAN you're probably not going to want to say you're going earlier in July because of your anxiety about the debt limit.

right. MS. GEORGE.  No, no.  You're

DUDLEY.  So then the question is, well, why is the FOMC going in non-press conference meeting?  It creates a little bit more confusion in the VICE CHAIRMAN July-in a marketplace with, what's the rush?

YELLEN.  Especially when the draft statement says that we will do this are in line with expectations, and there would not be much data in that CHAIR assuming incoming data short a span.

DUDLEY.  So I think the market would be surprised by a July VICE CHAIRMAN move.

compared with how we've been talking about it, but if you were putting out meeting, assuming you MS. GEORGE.  Well, I think without other clarification, that's right.  So I think it may seem rushed to us this detail at this meeting, it might not seem unusual to start at the next set expectations-

June 13-14, 2017

The July probability will go up after this meeting, whatever the decision to later this year.  It could go up by a lot-it's MR. POTTER. you make, just because we're getting closer possible.

President Rosengren. CHAIR YELLEN.

this press conference that there's not an that every meeting is potentially live?  To play a little devil's advocate to the Vice that much of a difference, I'm not different between July, September, or November.  But it's not so make that much of a difference, why we there are likely to be a lot of other to figure out an picking a period when there are other factors would be something to MR. ROSENGREN.  So is there a reason after expectation Chairman, moving it up or moving it back, if it doesn't make sure it's going to seem that clear to me, if moving up or back one meeting doesn't would pick a meeting at which we almost know a priori factors that we can't control that would be disruptive.  So if you're trying optimal timing, it seems think about.

bit of a similar debate.  And it's very This has gone, as following along with the was a push to do that, that might get the dynamics we saw in 2013 back into the market. MR. POTTER.  I think four years ago we had a hard to work out exactly what the reaction will be to any announcement that we give.  I don't know whether we can really look in their heads and think exactly like that. Lorie showed, very smoothly so far, and it seems to be because they're logic, and possibly the logic would say go in July.  If there some of

Yes.  If I could interject:  What I worry about a little bit the debt limit, which in some ways then amps that up as a potential issue the debt limit VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. is if you move in July, there's going to be a lot of speculation that you're moving in July because you are worried about for the market.  And I think, from our perspective, we should be as far away from

I would be reluctant to think of July as a first-order can go in September with delayed effect which I don't think we should be.

Treasury moving 100 basis points would be a big move. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I'm happy to explain why.  It's the percentage times the amount of movement.  So the 10-year Stocks moving 1 percent would be trivial.  So those weights don't really mean how important these variables are in the index.

shows that it's mostly the stock price financial conditions index?  Why are you this one as opposed to many others?  There are many others in the literature.  Is this MR. BULLARD.  No, I know.  But the blue bar movement-coupled with the credit spreads.  Why this showing me one judged to be different?

pretty similar to all of the other indexes.  I got a lot of people 'Why are you showing this index?'  For me, in terms viewed as the best description, this was the easiest one.  It has these little bit different from the one we use.  I CAPE is a useful thing to have in here-it basically is looking at earnings over the past MR. POTTER.  So it's asking me this question on the weekend: of trying to give you what I simple components in it.  The trade-weighted dollar is a think the 10 years and seeing what valuation looks like.

of the stories I've been hearing from market participants, who are very happy where the stock market values and credits are but don't completely understand what has thought this was the easiest way of giving you that viewpoint.  Financial conditions a lot.  There was a tight relationship before the election between what was happening conditions and what we saw in the expected forward timing of FOMC policy actions. So in terms with happened, I have eased in financial

June 13-14, 2017

now.  And we've definitely seen-even in a article, which was talking about the same thing-this somewhat conflicting signal. That seems to have disappeared right Wall Street Journal with this is that we have models.  Our models have rate, they have the 10-year yield, they the dollar.  So what are model by combining them all into MR. BULLARD.  I guess my issue all of these things in them.  They have the federal funds have credit spreads, they have equity prices, and they have the value of you getting in addition to having all of those variables in your an index and then showing me that?

There are a lot of data I could show you, and I was trying to summarize feeling for what financial market are talking about.  And they are focused on the fact that the FOMC is tightening. Committee is on a path that looks like the path that was expected in 2016 at first but tightening is happening at the same time that financial conditions measure, but on all measures.  For example, the one the Federal Reserve a much more sophisticated one than this, in which you for what's happening in growth and other things-that's also showing an easing of it's spending a lot of time thinking about. MR. POTTER. the overall push of that data since liftoff and try to give you a participants Now the didn't actually happen.  That are easing-not on this Bank of Chicago produces, which is adjust conditions.  So I don't know whether it's necessarily relevant to you in this room, but something that financial market participants are

Okay.  So what's different in this era since the election is the prospect tax reform, which has partly driven equity prices higher, and that's what's having a MR. BULLARD. of corporate major effect on this index.

There's that.  Earnings growth is very strong right now.  All the United States as having come down is also there.  So there are a MR. POTTER. discussion of risks outside the

of arguments as to why valuations look good.  That doesn't completely line up with where the for the policymakers around this table. lot 10-year yield is.  And that's an interesting issue that same issue.  Why not just talk about the fact are high and we're wondering what to do about it, if anything? MR. BULLARD.  It has certainly been an interesting issue for this group to talk about, whether there are equity price bubbles and whether we should react to those kinds of bubbles. This seems like a disguised way to talk about that equity prices

high in the stock market and how low right now.  It's something that we always grapple with-whether prices are or exuberance.  And right now I think the perspective we've had on it in past few months, informed by talking to market participants, is that there's a little bit more and complacency than you might feel comfortable with.  And I was trying that in an indirect way.  I could try and do it more directly next time. MR. POTTER.  I think I did talk about the nominal volatility is reflecting fundamentals the weight on exuberance to indicate

MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  Thank you.

Our forecast for GDP growth in 2017 is about ½ percentage point stronger, and our outlook for 2018 is modestly higher.  Not surprisingly, we have lowered our unemployment rate projection, both because of incoming news and to keep it aligned with our more upbeat assessment of spending and production.  As shown in the bottom-left panel, at the the unemployment by the end of 2019.

Of compensation per hour data, the black line, seem especially questionable at the weak fourth-quarter reading a shifting of income one quarter later in response to an expected reduction rates this year. In addition, as shown in panel 4, the wage data, on balance, have been rising about as we trend productivity growth and our assumptions about trend inflation.  However, to be clear, there is little that can be concluded decisively from the data because it is contradictory and noisy, and some of note, the the moment because anecdotal evidence suggests that may reflect in tax the primary reason we didn't interpret the inflation data as signaling a that we think the recent softness in core PCE inflation will prove monthly inflation forecasts But perhaps lower natural rate is transitory, and we've mostly left our subsequent unrevised.

And I would that a tax cut could be passed early next year and still have substantially the the baseline forecast.

If plausible scenario came to pass, our simulation points to an unemployment that turns up modestly next year and ends the medium term at about 4½ percent, funds rate would more slowly in this scenario.

question is for Stacey.  You were talking about the debate whether to lower the natural rate of unemployment, and I heard some the strongest argument, in your view, moving the natural rate of unemployment lower? MR. KAPLAN.  I guess this you were having about arguments on both sides.  I guess I would ask you, what's for not

TEVLIN. If we're looking at the data that we have received since December, which is that we don't think that that were expected to be much more I think we would take a closer look at that's probably the strongest argument. MS. is kind of how I was framing this discussion, the strongest argument the weak inflation data we are seeing are going to persist.  If serious, and to last longer in terms of the monthly rates, that, as well.  I think

MR. WILCOX.  The reason it's not in the presentation is because it's a concept doesn't factor directly into the way that we put way to describe this?  It's a sort of summary estimate that different set of machinery.  Is that a fair way to judgmental machinery Now, one way we would know that our projected outcomes accommodative monetary policy to accomplish that objective.  That's implicitly, would be a basis on which we could say, 'Oh, it must be the case that the natural rate of interest is lower than

I had a question for Stacey, but I'm going to pick up on this MR. WILLIAMS.  Actually, theme.  Everything you said was right, up to the fact that you used-

No, but you do actually use an estimate of  * in your MR. WILLIAMS.  Yes.  [Laughter] r Taylor rule, right?  Does that come into your policy assumption?  Is that right?

MR. WILCOX.  Correct.

MR. WILLIAMS.  Okay.

is:  Stacey reported an alternative which we removed the fiscal stimulus that we assumed.  When we put that assumed the intercept in the policy rule by 25 basis MR. WILCOX.  And so one practical example of that scenario in fiscal stimulus in, we boosted our assumed number for points.  If we were to take the plug for fiscal stimulus out, we would take the long-run intercept down 25 basis points.

two-hander while we're on this particular topic?  I guess I was President Kashkari's question more like, okay, so you think about cases in which down the natural rate of unemployment.

Well, let me try to address your question about, are structure of the economy changes that could be happening in-

MR. EVANS.  And the fiscal things that you were pointing to as well.

of the things that we have for the natural rate.  And, as you said, if the matching function has a shift in in the Beveridge curve over a few decades, and that's factored into our natural rate.  In addition, you could think of a lot of economists have spent a lot of time the data is lining up a pretty flat Phillips curve, it's hard to pin down a natural rate if all you is just how the data came in.  So we look at all of these different structural pieces determining where the natural rate likely is.  And I just want to be clear that while we look at MS. TEVLIN.  Yes, right.  So aging of the population is one built into our projection changed-we have seen something that we have other things that would be factored in there, and our labor looking at those.  The overall structural stuff is not just looking at whether exactly.  Because, with were looking at in all of this stuff, we don't have a very strong conviction.

MR. EVANS.  Sure.  Totally fair.

for now, but it's not MS. TEVLIN.  This is our best guess.  This is where we are something you can pin down very well.  And then the second part of your question-what was that again?  Or was that it?

MR. EVANS.  That was pretty much it.

June 13-14, 2017

fiscal policy assumptions on exhibit 3 in your presentation-so I are going to be these tax cutsuncertainty about this.  We've seen the markets move since November-the bond down, and stock markets stay high.  So when you actually really driving the scenario is not the change in the formulation of fiscal government, taxes, and things like that-but actually shifts in the sentiment as people decide that this is not going to happen.  But the probabilities your people are going to say, 'Oh, it's actually happening,' so already placing a low That was a long sentence, and it went all over the place, but you're kind of stuck. alternative is probabilistic.  So how did you come numbers? MR. WILLIAMS.  I'll go back to my question.  Stacey, going back to this issue of the alternative scenario and actually thought this was a tricky scenario to grapple with myself.  You have this roughly onethird probability, according to the prediction markets, that there and a lot of market come down, the dollar come run this scenario, my understanding on the basis of reading the Tealbook and listening to your comments is that what's policy itself-the and financial conditions have already come down a lot.  So how do you assess that?  You're basically either in baseline making an assumption that they're going to be more optimistic than they are today.  And in the alternative, you're going to say that they're going to be a little bit more pessimistic, but they're probability. Your baseline is a probabilistic thing, and this up with these particular the baseline is a modal assumption. MS. TEVLIN.  So

fine.  But on this one, you're taking itWe are basically assuming that a lot of the strong sentiment in both the and the businesses in our baseline is not just due to this.  But we don't know, right? fiscal stimulus was in in there anymore?  What's the effect on consumption going to MR. WILLIAMS.  Yes, I know.  The baseline is MS. TEVLIN. households So we did an experiment in which we said, okay, what if suddenly the there, and now it's not going to be

And then the same thing for hit the excess bond premium and said, 'Let's assume that there's currently assuming in the alternative scenario.

'delta' here is kind of an upper bound to the MR. WILLIAMS.  Would you say that the effects of this fiscal scenario?

We specifically effects out.  We're going to imagine a scenario really misinterpreted all of this strength in business sentiment, and misinterpreted all of the strength in the stock market, and it's more tied to fiscal policy And that's the scenario we ran, seems like a possible worry. MS. TEVLIN.  I don't know if it's an upper bound, but it's big, right? said we're not just going to pull the fiscal policy in which we say, wow, we've we really than we really understood.  And what if all of that came out? because that

scenarios.  I don't I know you only did one of the alternative scenarios, not all of what struck me when I look out at 2019 was a number of them had unemployment that were quite low-3.1, 3.4, 3.5 percent-and yet the penalty for getting to very low highest inflation rate is 2.3 percent.  So one question a chance that as we get to very low unemployment rates that we haven't the responsiveness of wages and prices might be a little different?  And the stability in the context scenarios, but sometimes if we don't see problems in inflation when we have a very MR. ROSENGREN.  I have a question on some of the alternative know if that's fair game, because them.  But rates unemployment rates seems quite low.  The is:  Do you think there's seen in 50 years that second part to that question would be, we don't really talk about financial of these

Yes, most of these do not have any nonlinear effects in terms of inflation does, but I might be misremembering that. the one that we get a little bit of inflation out of. MS. TEVLIN. once you get really low on the unemployment rate.  I think one of them actually does.  I think the stronger aggregate demand and higher inflation one And that's and that is something that a possibility.  There are a lot of people on the staff working on that kind of research that we definitely consider that there is some risk of that-that if low that there could lead to a nonlinear response of inflation.  That's not right now, but I think that's something that we consider a concern. We have looked at the issue of nonlinear effects in inflation, we think is now, looking across different geographic regions to try to identify it, because it's hard to identify.  And I think unemployment gets that our baseline

something that's difficult to model, and it's difficult to feed through.  It's not these particular scenarios this time.  We have occasionally done it in the past, but our themselves to that kind of thing very well. In terms of the financial stability issues, it's not something we usually take on very seriously here.  It's in any of particular types of models don't lend

MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you.

You know, the inflation penalty isn't very large, even in the scenario cited-stronger aggregate demand and higher inflation.  That one does have a lower-left panel, we do manage to 2.3 percent in the course of that scenario.  The inflation result that would MR. WILCOX. that Stacey nonlinear Phillips curve.

had interesting discussions international my attention was the long-term inflation expectations, and in the euro area I to figure out if current inflation expectations are above that 2014 period that got in the ECB.  At any rate, in view of somewhat similar experiences, or at least the economies, is there a common theme or explanation that maybe we attention to?  It makes me nervous.  I guess that's my question. MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Both presentations about wages and inflation developments, and U.S. productivity growth has been slower than everybody would have liked.  Then you talked about wage struggles and the economy.  What got was trying Draghi's attention influences, across all of should be paying some

I have no idea if this is fair just asking.  [Laughter] And President Rosengren asked if something was fair game. game.  I'm

MR. WILCOX.  It's all fair game.

MR. EVANS.  Thank you.

In terms of the specific question about where inflation expectations are Japan compared with several years ago, I think it's quite striking that Draghi gave his Jackson Hole speech in August 2014, and then subsequently they that fall and in the early part of 2015.  And similarly MR. ERCEG. now in the euro area and five-year, five-year-forwards, as shown in exhibit 6, are essentially where they were when President engaged in their large-scale QE programs with Japan, the five-year-forwards are about where they were when Abe started his program.

June 13-14, 2017

there are certainly commonalities.  The ECB, in particular, in its communications that wage growth has been very weak.  President Draghi mentioned that in his the European parliament in late May, for instance, and thought that it basically ECB being able to achieve its price-stability mandate.  They've unemployment would fall, but still wages have come out continual surprise for them.  They think that the increase in employment they have experienced has partly been part-time workers coming back and essentially some So the unemployment rate masks some of the weakness in the nominal wage growth.  The long time a pickup in nominal wages that hasn't their estimate of the natural rate.  In consequence, 4½ percent. I think has stressed testimony before presented a substantial risk to the increasingly emphasized how they see 'shadow slack' playing out for wages.  They've consistently underpredicted how fast very weak.  It's been a that fall in labor force participation. labor market that might still persist and has accounted for weak Bank of England has similarly forecast for a materialized.  They've progressively reduced it now stands at that your question raises is, what is the to be depressing wage growth in all of these countries?  You know, we don't We have some possibilities.  But one of them is certainly the damage done lasting effects. MR. KAMIN.  If I could add just-one issue factor that seems have a single answer. to labor markets after the Great Recession, which hit all of these countries very hard, has had very

in train for many years from emerging market manufacturing that markets. A second possibility-and these are all interrelated-is that there's considerable competition.  It's been somehow has either been accentuated or become exposed by the effects of the Great Recession, and that's also put its mark on labor

June 13-14, 2017

that we notice in all of these countries there's been a stepcontributing to the wage growth being seen throughout the advanced economies.  But exactly right one, and to what extent, is something on which we just a great handle. And then a final possibility is down in labor productivity growth.  And that, too, is probably a factor subdued nominal which of these explanations is the don't have

And I've been concerned about this for the Committee that the of unemployment is kind of a free parameter, and if inflation is not behaving the way move the natural rate of unemployment around.

And particularly, we have assumptions trend rate of inflation and how we interpret inflation expectations.  Now, that doesn't to say that the Phillips curve is working MS.

There are other things that about the really help you, because that's like another free parameter, and you can imagine we could use the two of those to make our Phillips curve fit and continue because we're moving two parameters around.

June 13-14, 2017

there is still evidence that the Phillips curve is working, it's just very flat.  The in the inflation data unfortunately can swamp the signal given by the slack variable Phillips curve-is so flat.  But it is still a regression, and you also see stronger evidence of the Phillips curve with the wage cross-sectional data you see it as well.  I would argue that we're sticking with the would throw it over, model that we think is as sensible and fits the data as well as the Phillips I think noise that is because the Phillips curve-particularly the price significant in data, and in Phillips curve for right now.  If there were a great other model, maybe we but I'm not aware of a curve right now.

Well, you could look at a leading theory, like New Keynesian-type Phillips curves in which the gap term unemployment or the flexible price things to looked at all of those types of Phillips curves, but we can certainly evaluate them again.

It is worth noting that the rate path is tighter than the median SEP in March and, apparently, at this funds rate this year and five 25 basis However, I believe the outcome is less than desirable, as unemployment rate projected for monetary policy to achieve a than that imbedded in the current Tealbook.

They generally suggest a value of the natural rate of between 4½ and 5 percent-Stacey discussed this-as does the Tealbook.

I see little reason to believe that the U.S. economy with respect growing at a pace meaningfully above the trend pace.

most reasonable conclusion on which to base U.S. monetary policy is that the that shall now remain in place a major unanticipated shock occurs.  This conclusion is bolstered by relatively weak and also by demographic factors. I think the U.S. economy has simply converged on a 2 percent growth regime until productivity growth in recent years labor markets may appear to be stronger, but the growth rate of payroll labor input measured about this pace as well. National employment measured from one year earlier peaked in early 2015 at 2.3 percent and has been declining ever since.  It is currently about 1.6 percent.  The growth in the by total hours is increasing at

the labor input is growing at a pace roughly consistent with annual labor productivity growth rate, past several years.  Accordingly, I am hesitant to interpret as indicating that the economy is growing faster than it ordinarily would the trend pace. One conclusion I draw is that 2 percent real GDP growth, if we assume a ½ percent which is what it has been over the recent labor market data at unemployment rate has fallen to 4.3 percent nationally.

In fact, despite recently, the outlook still looks quite positive, sheets in good shape and, I think, importantly, international activity on a and a more solid footing than we've seen in some time.

Long-term Treasury weakened, and the stock market continues to rise.  Although spreads have been relatively stable recently, they're also very narrow.  The fact that conditions remain very easy should provide support to economic activity, and, to me, implies that we have more to do, not less to do, in terms of monetary policy overall financial conditions that influence more powerfully than the level of the federal funds rate. Third, despite our efforts to remove accommodation, financial defined, have continued yields have declined, the dollar has credit financial this development tightening.

It will to take some time for that to occur. But a competing explanation is the than 2 percent currently, there happen-it's just going these explanations is the correct one.  I've leaned a bit in the that.  Even accepting the fact that we don't really know what's going on competing explanations is the correct one-I still think there's a good case monetary policy further. Now, I don't know which of direction of a lower natural rate of unemployment in my SEP submission, but I don't really have a lot of conviction about here-which of these for tightening

it seems to me that we should tighten, because we should want to conditions somewhat both to restrain economic activity and also-from a perspective-to lean against some of the 'frothiness' that at least I see in market valuations, I continue to be puzzled by yields.

My expectation is that this closure will occur quickly enough the unemployment rate to bottom out at just above 4 percent next year.  Of course, it lower or higher even if growth remains moderate, depending on the labor force participation rate, productivity, and other hard-to-predict factors. Importantly, the moderate overall growth that we have seen over the past been accompanied by a gradual deceleration in employment.  Monthly payroll gains have averaged 160,000 since 2015, and 250,000 in 2014.  To be sure, the slower pace seen so far the range the gap has rate to cause could end up somewhat movements in that I anticipate a red-hot labor market?  Well, no, because I is currently close to its sustainable longer-run level.  Of course, the to pin down the natural rate of unemployment right that it is close to 5 percent.

judgment on estimates I recently reviewed that are derived from several models all incorporate a Phillips curve and use trend-cycle changes over time in the natural rate and in potential output series. I base that different state-space models.  These decomposition techniques to infer from co-movements among a variety of output, labor, and inflation value of the natural rate vary across these models, with some as high as 5 percent.  But, in general, they are centered on 4½ percent.  This with the subdued wage growth we continue to see as well as increases in the average age and education of the labor force have in recent years. Estimates of the current low as 4 percent and as figure strikes me as more consistent with research suggesting that pushed down the natural rate

the natural rate are all conditioned on the assumption that been running at 2 percent for some time.  Admittedly, one as the staff does, interpret the data as indicating that expectations have been anchored at a and under that assumption, the data should instead be interpreted as indicating that rate is greater than estimated by the state-space models.  Otherwise, it would be to reconcile the average historical levels of inflation and the unemployment rate.  The the higher resource utilization implied by a higher natural rate would be needed to get the lower level of inflation expectations. Importantly, these estimates of long-run inflation expectations have might, lower level, the natural difficult medium-term policy implications of this alternative interpretation, however, are not very large, because inflation back to 2 percent, taking into account as indicative of a 'warm,' and not a 'hot,' labor market.  With inflation still running noticeably below our see such labor market conditions as appropriate, especially in view of that than I anticipated earlier in the year. Based on these econometric results, I have lowered my SEP forecast of the longer-run unemployment rate to 4½ percent.  As a result, I view 4 percent unemployment merely 2 percent objective, I progress on reaching our inflation objective has been slower

But think we should dismiss out of hand the possibility that they may be a harbinger of persistent.  Tomorrow's CPI release may provide some clues on that score.  In arithmetically hold down inflation measured on a 12-month Core CPI prices were surprisingly weak in both March and April, and excluding the erratic nonmarket mean PCE index was also weak.

It rise to greater resource pressure than I anticipate, conceivably causing inflation to and inflation expectations to begin ratcheting up. in light of the stability of inflation expectations over the past 20 years, and with little if at all, at high levels of resource emergence of a persistent inflation problem would likely be a slow process, ample time to take corrective action.  We should also have time to take corrective signs of rising leverage or other emerging financial vulnerabilities-again, don't expect.  We also have to bear in mind that a policy designed to keep the natural rate may well be many workers, it would also slow the 2 percent inflation, and this might even cause inflation expectations to begin ratcheting To be sure, allowing unemployment to run in the vicinity of could give persistently overshoot our 2 percent objective But evidence that the slope of the Phillips curve steepens much, utilization, the affording us action if we see something I unemployment at 4½ percent or higher could pose its own risks, as lower.

The next discuss two possibly complementary answers to this question, derived data as well as from the staff's OIS term structure model that accounts effective lower bound.  The first possibility, to which Simon already alluded, risks to the outlook as being skewed to the downside; the second returns on assets such as OIS weakening economy or which these contracts deliver relatively high How should we interpret OIS path signal disagreement with the SEP outlook, in extremis an expectation of a recession not too far into the future, or some other considerations that would lead you not to deliver as many three panels from survey for the is that investors see is that investors are willing to accept low expected contracts because they want to insure themselves against a declining inflation, circumstances in returns.

That is, even conditional on not returning to the lower bound, the mean, shown in line 4, is substantially below the mode, suggesting that survey respondents place substantial odds on a more gradual path than the SEP median even in benign scenarios.

DUDLEY.  I think we have to keep stressing that we are pretty sort of a potential vulnerability. a bumpy ride. MR. FISCHER.  And what conclusion do you draw from that for policy? VICE CHAIRMAN confident that we are going to do quite a bit more.  The bigger the gap between where we think we're going and where the market thinks we're going, that is We'd like to have a smooth ride rather than the rest of the world.  So we'll than this unless we see it higher MR. POTTER.  The other issue is just where rates are in constantly hear that the U.S. 10-year can't get much higher elsewhere.

I think, in addition to the international environment, which is earlier movement that we saw seemed to be very MS. BRAINARD. weighing on the long end of the curve, all of the

CHAIR YELLEN.  Other questions?

start to balance sheet if you're worried about why the 10-year is so low?  One of the answers is that times when we're raising the short-term rate, we don't have a big balance sheet. that we have starting at the short end and not moving the long end until this point in the cycle.  So long end of the yield with a big balance sheet.  That is one of the differences this time. MR. ROSENGREN.  Wouldn't all this discussion imply an earlier normalization during normal This time around we have a big balance sheet, so I think it's partly a policy choice made about we have a yield-curve-flattening strategy.

June 14 Session

YELLEN.  Good morning, everybody.  We're going to start off this morning by CHAIR asking David to discuss this morning's releases.

a summary table that provides results to you to one digit.  Because this is a decline of 6 basis points-so a top-line CPI.  Of greater concern, though, is the fact that the 6 basis points, whereas we had expected an increase of 18 basis MR. WILCOX. 7   Thank you, Madam Chair.  This was another weaker release than we had expected.  There is an issue of some precision, I'm going to give you some figures to two digits.  Top-line CPI prices declined 13 basis points.  We had been expecting difference of 7 basis points on the core CPI index increased points-so a difference in core CPI space of 12 basis points.

a third month.  They were down 0.8 percent, not at an annual rate, in May. On preliminary inspection, three categories stand out as especially weak.  Apparel prices declined for than we had expected.  That's a category that prices figure into the CPI.  But in constructing the PCE index, the BEA does not port over medical services prices from the CPI into the PCE components of the PPI in constructing the PCE price index, and medical as weak in the PPI as they were in the CPI.  Yesterday we got the PPI, services prices. Medical services prices also were weaker we focus on because medical services price index.  Instead, they use services prices were not and we were not surprised by the medical

had expected, equally weak in both the PPI and CPI relative to our expectations. Airfares declined in both the PPI and the CPI.  They were weaker than we but they were essentially a good translation yet because we're having some mechanical difficulties in about 10 or 20 I don't have getting the data loaded into the system.  I'm hoping and expecting to have that

June 13-14, 2017

All told, as I mentioned, there's a surprise of about 12 basis points on core CPI prices. the ability to refine this later on this morning-is in terms of the PCE price index will be about two-thirds of that.  So, for discussion right now, let's call it an 8 basis point surprise weaker on the core PCE means is an increase in May in core PCE prices of about 8 basis points minutes. Our rough guesstimate-and I'd like to have that the surprise purposes of price index.  What that rather than the 15 or 16 that we had been projecting in the Tealbook.

are a variety of possibilities.  One is that it could be that little more slack in the economy-as Stacey indicated in her discussion yesterday, to a question from President Kaplan.  The Phillips curve is flat even if we were to mark down our assumption about the natural rate of tenths, that would account for essentially nothing of the surprise An obvious next question is, what are some hypotheses about the economic mechanism that could be at work here?  There there's a particularly, I believe, in response enough that unemployment by a couple of this morning in the CPI.

likely more empirically important is some possibility that maybe there's into domestic consumer of that pass-through may be different than what we had We've seen a turnaround in import prices this year over last year.  Last year, in 2016, in positive territory.  So that's an area that we'll be having a close look at. I think something going on with regard to the pass-through of import prices prices-that the timing or magnitude assumed. import prices declined.  This year, they're up-not robustly, but they're we've been expecting some greater support for core goods prices domestically.  But, nonetheless, I think pass-through of the enormous energy price declines don't have right.  Another possibility that isn't very satisfying but that I random variation even ex post.  The residual in any There could be something about the into core prices that we think needs to be taken seriously is, there is

June 13-14, 2017

accounts for a large amount of the total variation.  That said, We've been, in some sense, release, I'm less confident lot of crispness, and I think we have to be open econometric equation for inflation this is another in a sequence of generally downward misses. reserved in our expectations about how quickly inflation was going to come up, and, even so, we have tended to be wrong to the downside.  So I think, in light of this in asserting that these are transitory factors with a to the possibility that there's something a little more going on here that we don't understand.

you want to also comment on retail sales? sales release.  Again, I have a very preliminary translation incorporates the price news into its implications for real spending, that will be the combination of the two releases that we received this morning. CHAIR YELLEN.  Did MR. WILCOX.  Oh, the retail of that, and I have nothing that because real PCE spending were revised up one-tenth in March and two-tenths in April. in growth rate terms in May than what we had expected.  The in nominal termstaking account of the price news-this would imply just a very marginal upward very equally marginal downward real spending in the third quarter.  I'm guessing that the weaker-than-expected price can bring to the table this morning right now, I'd say it's Nominal sales were pretty close to our expectations.  The components that the BEA uses to construct They were three-tenths weaker pretty rough translation that I had the opportunity to do thus far suggests that again, not revision to our projection for second-quarter spending and a revision to news will probably-logically, it's got to offset some of that, basically on consumer spending. For purposes of the accuracy that I likely, I'm guessing, about a wash.

there questions for David? CHAIR YELLEN.  Are not really a question.  There are two big MR. KAPLAN.  I guess I might ask one, but it's trends going on globally that we've talked about.  One is technology-enabled disruption, which is

June 13-14, 2017

lots of industries and limiting pricing power.  And trend is global overcapacity, particularly because of the growth in China.  You labor market domestically.  Inflation may be more affected by global factors even I just wonder how you factor in those two trends. clearly affecting apparel, but it's affecting then the other big have a tight with a tight domestic labor market.

Let me take the import competition first.  In some sense, we cheat a little we put import prices directly into our equation as a right-hand-side variable.  It's an for domestic inflation.  And we had seen some turnaround, as I mentioned, not that there isn't anything to that story.  But one needs to refine the that the competitive margin is greater than otherwise and the timing of the pass-through what we had anticipated. MR. WILCOX. bit because explanatory variable in import prices.  So it's story so is a little different than that the pass-through is quite quick from import prices into within a quarter.  So, in light of the modest turnaround in first quarter and what we think will be a more substantial increase in the the import-induced weakness in domestic goods prices was Now, it may be that that factor is a little more persistent than what we wrote In the past, we've observed domestic prices-generally speaking, import prices in the second quarter, we had assumed that pretty much done. down.

I'm wondering, do you look beyond import prices?  For example, a the industries-energy is a great example-compete in a global market.  It's having may not be showing up in import prices.  But it may be showing up, how that factors into your thinking. MR. KAPLAN. number of an effect even though it nevertheless, because it's a global market, and I wonder

Again, in an effort to explain domestic core goods-that is, non-energy items are into the process and we think that influences the price-setting behavior of domestic MR. WILCOX. and food prices-we do use energy prices as an explanatory variable, because energy an input

But we producers.  So those relationships evolve, for sure, over prices evolution in do try to take account of that.

past at this and have not measure global overcapacity is pretty darn imperfect probably, to put it having been said, we have excavated like crazy in the past, and we've not found measures of resource utilization once we control for that you were highlighting-energy prices, commodity prices, and import prices.  Once in on the right-hand side, we can't find anything.  Now, my recollection is coauthor is sitting on my direct left.  So, would you elaborate on that? On the global overcapacity hypothesis, we've looked in the found-our ability to charitably.  That any additional explanatory power for global the items we got those variables that a

Actually, I wouldn't add much.  That pretty much says it, which is, we ran by measures of global like global output gaps, and they did not add much explanatory power to our straight MR. KAMIN. Phillips curve-type regressions for the United States that were augmented slack, Phillips curves.

I would also note that, as far as the overcapacity now, some of the concerns are very focused on metals, steel, and other areas of which China has overinvested.  And I guess, just on the on the recent CPI, that was not where the price dips were most concentrated, right?  You mentioned apparel there's more of an ability to focus

I'll make one more point, and I'll stop the questioning and be quiet. it measuring that is very hard.  It's hard to run models to map MR. KAPLAN. Returning to the disruption, I take

June 13-14, 2017

it's changing so rapidly.  I assume that five years from now we'll be able to effect of that is. what's going on, as look back more easily, but it's hard to judge currently what the me try to give one piece of intuition for that.  A commonplace observation is is down, and some metrics of that are that fewer new firms are being labor market, it remains the case that an jobs are both created and destroyed every month.  My recollection is, are created or destroyed every month.  However, that's it's a little less true now than it was a decade or two ago.  Because of the but it's a handle on it. MR. WILCOX.  It is.  It's even hard to assert with confidence what the sign is of disruption, and let that business dynamism created.  Job churn has trended down, so, in the astonishing number of something like 4½ or 5 million jobs always been true, and prevalence of anecdotes in this regard, my conviction is, there's got to be something to it, pretty hard for us to get

MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Evans.

I think, more generally, President Kaplan raises a very interesting whatever reason: competition, or whatnot.  And the question was, back in the '90s, 'Well, this inflation down closer to what we always wanted it to be,' so doing it back then, some measure of MR. EVANS.  Well, point here.  David, I think of you as really an expert on this, thinking back to your mid-1990s opportunistic disinflation research in a different environment-the question of whether there's some type of underlying secular trend, perhaps in pricing power, for technology, global could be an opportunity to get you'd run policy somewhat tighter.  You'd have, if we were equilibrium  * that would tell us whether we're running tighter. r still is, what's the stance of monetary policy that gives rise to the lift in inflation? Now, we're in a different environment in which, in my opinion, inflation is lower, and the question

June 13-14, 2017

that type of thinking at this point, or are these more transitory That's really the big question. Do you think there's anything to headwinds?

There may be something to it, but I think it's going to be extremely MR. WILCOX. difficult for us to discern that in real time.

basis of what we know right now-on the basis of a the data into our system, but, again, it does not include non-market-based know those until the BEA publishes the monthly PCE price index at the month.  Taking that on board, we estimate the shortfall in core PCE prices to be 9 pretty close to the 8 basis points that I mentioned earlier this morning. accounts for about 3 basis points.  There's some weakness that we don't and other basis points.  So it's a little of this and a little of that, but reasonably close to I did get an update, and, on the complete loading of prices because we won't end of the basis points, so that was Of that, apparel understand in other durable goods that accounts for about 2 basis points; airfares services, about 3 what we had guesstimated on a rougher basis earlier.

YELLEN.  Any further questions for David?  [No response]  Okay.  Before we say that, these data do seem to me to be a significant enough modest adjustment to the statement of alt-B-not a would propose doing is taking the final sentence of the second alt-A and substituting that sentence for the final sentence in the second paragraph of CHAIR begin our policy round, let me surprise on inflation that it might warrant a change in the policy actions, but I would like to propose and then get your reactions to a wording change in alt-B.  What I paragraph in alt-B.

MR. LAUBACH.

The final two sentences.

final two sentences.  The end of paragraph 2 in alt-B would read 'Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the CHAIR YELLEN.  The as follows:

June 13-14, 2017

is monitoring inflation developments closely.'  We have had wording there about and financial developments.  I think we've in recent meetings that we're less concerned about global economic and financial sense, that sentence has become 'boilerplate.'  We continue in international developments as being relevant to our evaluation of the Committee closely monitoring inflation and global economic concluded developments.  And, in a paragraph 3 to highlight economy.

related to our assessment of near-term risks, rid of the global developments piece and leave it as a statement about inflation, it's a it would highlight that we are monitoring inflation overall evaluation of would like to put that on the table as a change in alt-B and ask your reaction to it. So, at the end of paragraph 2, which is really if we get relatively small change.  But I think developments closely without affecting, really, in any significant way our the economy or the proposed policy actions.  So I proposal for a

EVANS.  I'm sorry, Madam Chair.  Could you just repeat that?  I had trouble MR. finding my handout.

YELLEN.  Yes.  I propose that the last sentence in the second paragraph of alt-B 'Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly is monitoring inflation developments closely.' CHAIR would be altered to read as follows: balanced, but the Committee some modest revisions on the basis of this news.  I don't in the press conference about it, I will simply say the SEP does not incorporate this morning's readings. Let me say that there have been no changes in the SEP submissions.  Conceivably, some of you might have wanted to make know if that's true or not.  But if I am asked that

having read the sheet more carefully, could I give just In April, the estimated increase in core PCE prices was MR. WILCOX.  Madam Chair, two additional pieces of information?

June 13-14, 2017

than 1 basis point.  You're not going to believe index for April rather than two-tenths before, despite a revision of less than 1 basis point.  So I won't be surprised if there's some the month:  'Oh, core PCE prices were revised Less than a basis point is the measure there. 15 basis points before.  It remains 15 basis points, but there was a small downward surprise in PPI prices yesterday that will account for less this, but although it will still round, on our estimate, to 15 basis points, it will show up to one decimal as one-tenth on the core PCE price the fact that it's commentary when that's published at the end of down one-tenth in April.'

thing I thought I should mention is that, on our estimate, 12-month core PCE 1.4 percent June Tealbook.  We continue to think the top-line will increase 1.5 percent.  That's unrevised from the June Tealbook.  Thank you. The other prices, we now think, will show an increase over the 12 months ending in May of rather than the 1.5 percent that we had in the PCE prices

YELLEN.  Okay.  So, yes, the proposal substitutes the final two sentences in CHAIR paragraph 2 of alt-B.  Question.

say, I think what you're proposing makes a lot the first paragraph of alt-B, it's pretty matter-of-fact about It's saying, 'Just the facts, ma'am.'  And then this actually says that it's on our radar monitoring.  So I think that's prudent, frankly, in view of the fact that VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I'd like to of sense, because if you look at inflation. as something that we're we don't know what's actually going to happen.

start with President Evans. CHAIR YELLEN.  Exactly.  Okay.  I would like to hear your input on this-your reaction to that proposal as we go around.  Let's continue to be nervous about the to deliver sustainable inflation at our 2 percent objective within a reasonable optimistic SEPs have inflation reaching target next year.  According to the MR.

Furthermore, the economy will surely turn down again at If we truly fear risks of being at the lower bound again in the future, then I believe must strongly defend our strategic commitment to a symmetric inflation objective. rate path that truly generates the possibility that inflation percent during this rate cycle.

This reinforces the 2 percent is a ceiling. In this wonder, can this path deliver enough support for symmetric objective?  And, again, I worry that other communications hamper our ability achieve this goal. 2 percent and downplay the acceptability of public impression among many that

be particularly careful not to set expectations of an overly aggressive on inflation.  It is key that policy expectations the Phillips curve is so flat.  One way to do just adequate in this regard by indicating that inflation has been running remain so in the near term.  It was helpful to remove the language initial draft that referred to recent low readings as likely reflecting transitory factors.  That would convey much more confidence about a at the moment. Madam Chair, I do support alternative B today with the changes that you just suggested. But my preference is to funds rate path that would impede our progress assert a strong upward pull on inflation, especially as this is to avoid being overly optimistic about inflation improvements in our communications.  I think alternative B is below target and is expected to in the was too sanguine.  In my opinion, that language favorable inflation outlook than some of us have modal forecast, this envisions delaying the next six months could push that date forward or back. Madam Chair, strategically, I favor a data-dependent path beyond today's decision, much as you described yesterday evening.  Under my current any further rate increases at least until December, with the obvious caveat that important data developments over

Dudley has several times, there's a natural way to do this and still not move the funds rate late in the year.  This would be to announce the implementation of balance sheet funds rate target at 1 to 1¼ percent, for December, take a the data available then, and make the important decision as to whether 2017 ends up or three-rate-hike year. Now, it seems obvious that the Committee has a strong desire to take some action at each press conference meeting this year unless something goes awry.  As Vice Chairman spoken about again until normalization at our September meeting while keeping the which I assume will be the result after today's action.  We can then wait hard look at being a two-

June 13-14, 2017

waiting until December to perhaps choose three rate hikes for 2017 doesn't large to me.  If inflationary conditions improve by then, the Committee would be well in four or five rate hikes for 2018, if necessary.  In a robust expansion, The risks of seem positioned to pencil without need of monetary support, this is just business as usual.

This scenario Committee's resolve to achieve a symmetric 2 percent not sure what we can do at that point to allay that perception, and I certainly hope the future will not fear asset purchases, because that's something that going to have to do in sufficient capacity if we do run into those risks. On the other side of the end of would risk further questioning of the target.  I'm that the Committee in we're these two scenarios, I see the strategy of 'balance sheet in September' and risk-management plan.  Thank you, In light of 'hold on rates at least until December' as a pretty decent Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer. CHAIR

and I am comfortable with another 25 basis point rate hike at this meeting, words on inflation that will be made more in paragraph 2 of alt-B. MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As I noted yesterday, the economy appears to remain on track, though I also, obviously, support the cautionary powerful the revised version of alt-B and its analysis of the reasons for raising the federal more information on how we will the size of our balance sheet, and I fully support today's balance sheet policy I support funds rate today.  Further, I think we're ready to provide normalize announcements.

June 13-14, 2017

regard to balance sheet normalization, I congratulate the staff and relevant parts of to decide when to begin.  There seem to be two approaches to that decision.  One is to say much matter, because know what we plan on doing, so whatever effects that the process of on the financial markets will be reflected in asset prices.  Further, there of future contingencies that might cause us not to want to move ahead with that plan, approach that beneficial option. With management for proposing the very sensible strategy we now plan to implement, and all that is left is that once we've announced the plan, the date of implementation does not market participants will normalization will have are all sorts and we retain under this a good plan-and we do-there is no to fortune.  We cannot both claim that the plan effect as soon as it is announced and say that the plan will not be implemented in and ramps up.  But it is the increases in Treasury and The second approach is to say that once we have sense in leaving it hanging out there as a hostage will have its certain circumstances.  The fact is, this is a good plan, which starts small designed not to ramp up to the point at which the weight of government-backed assets being returned to the markets will become excessive.

That is well below the pace of some of our purchases during much as $85 billion per month under the openmarkets will have time to prepare and to ramp up, the effect At the start, planned redemptions will be small, no more once the caps have reached their final values, we'll be redeeming no more longer-term the QE phase of monetary policy, which were as ended purchase program.  And, as on markets should be manageable.

June 13-14, 2017

more and more of that belief in the press.  Furthermore, our that markets, although one begins to see own communications between now and then, including this afternoon's press conference and the upcoming monetary policy testimony, could substantially reduce any element of surprise remains.

the result would be an outsize market reaction.  In fact, having expect to announce by the end of the year, it's better that we announce a of the timing are still diffuse, rather than wait until expectations have Rather than backing ourselves to fix expectations of the start date of the plan, we can, by the market has developed firm convictions.  And if expectations would not necessarily be a bad thing. Thus, I do not think that already revealed that we date while expectations hardened, perhaps onto a date that we later find inconvenient. into a corner by allowing the market announcing in July, act before for policy did adjust somewhat, that in the right direction if we As Thomas noted yesterday, markets currently appear to price in significantly less tightening than we expect, although we have to wait and see what today's data on prices imply for what markets expect.  But I believe that expectations would move announced an earlier date than is currently expected.

to add a few remarks about future interest rate policy.  As discussed appear to have become somewhat complacent about the outlook, and perhaps somewhat complacent.  Consider again the possibility I presented coming year, with still-accommodative financial rate below 4 percent, and inflation moving higher-a circumstance I'd also like yesterday, markets we, too, have become yesterday in which we find ourselves, over the conditions, an unemployment in which we'd have to tighten policy significantly more rapidly than currently expected.

in which whatever is moving inflation at the moment, or measures.  We've tended not to talk about Or consider another possibility in which political factors, begin to affect future policy

That is to say, as we estimates of to adjust interest rates in either direction and behavior of the financial markets to these political factors, and not talking whatever political uncertainties there uncertainty about future Even if policies do not, in the end, prove that is likely to reduce the aggregate demand and future aggregate supply by its effects on the capital stock and productivity growth, and that move ahead and continue approaching  * from below and moving further below our r the natural rate of unemployment, we may need potentially more rapidly than our communications and the date have been assuming.

And an advance reading provided, possibly unintentionally, by David said it's now 20 percent.  Maybe that's just an approximation?

The two types of expectations formation, in modern language, are MCE-model-consistent expectations, once known as rational expectations-and VAR-based, otherwise known as adaptive expectations.

My own view is that we the gradual reduction in the balance sheet.  While shrinking very gradually and remaining in the background, current indicate that we should not delay that process.  The costs of moving earlier than some expect need to be weighed against the rates by waiting too long.  Delaying past July an announcement of balance unduly complicate our normalization process, in view budget talks, and the appointment of

It's to note that none of these policy rules incorporate the sizable balance sheet, which, if While of thumb, policy rules historical norms.  All of the simple policy policy important

Even more the Tealbook's optimal control simulations highlight the risk that the federal funds much higher, particularly if unemployment and inflation deviations are loss function. taken into account, implies an even strikingly, rate would need to be equally weighted in the gradual increase in the federal funds rate when we decide to the data evolve consistent with the Tealbook, a could be made for even tighter policy this year and next than the policy assumption Tealbook.

on the appropriate path toward normalizing the is to assume four rate increases year and next, just as in the Tealbook.  And, as noted in our discussions yesterday, conditions have actually been strengthening as we've been raising rates.  I'd to reiterate something President Kaplan said.  I think it would be very helpful in our July try to understand what it is that we're learning moves in general.  Our own work at the Federal Reserve Bank of that market participants, at least according to the TIPS long-run real interest rate is very low, and that helps explain some of the that we're seeing.  There are obviously alternative views on that.  I think that's issue:  How accommodative is monetary policy, Taking these actions today keeps us stance of policy.  My view of the appropriate policy rate path both this overall financial like meeting, and maybe in future meetings, to really from asset prices and market San Francisco has highlighted the point market, believe that the asset price levels worth diving into.  And it gets back to this actually, relative to a long-run norm?

preferred pace of rate increases is faster than markets or the median FOMC I'm most of the a high degree of gradualism and downside risk it. My participant expects.  Nonetheless, as President Rosengren has already stressed, the path that describing lies below nearly all of the policy rules shown in the Tealbook as well as optimal control paths.  In the Tealbook, the unemployment rate falls below 4 percent, and the inflation rate persistently, although modestly, overshoots our objective.  In other words, the Tealbook funds rate path already has management embedded in

normalization in September, as you approach on the balance sheet that, from the beginning, is in the the 'Greenspan conundrum' alternative scenario today is more likely than a scenario.  Thank you. Finally, I support announcing the balance sheet suggested.  I strongly prefer an background.  Moving sooner or later, I think, interferes with that.  I like the approach that you outlined, assuming the economy performs broadly as expected.  Markets have taken our announcements about balance sheet normalization in stride.  I think that's an understatement.  So I don't expect an adverse market reaction as we move forward with these announcements.  In fact, I do think that reinvestment taper tantrum

BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I One is the financial conditions price-level path of placed for conditions index, as has been talked about here, a lot of these types of rate increases and came the effective lower bound.  We also saw yesterday that, at least for the Goldman index, a lot is driven by the S&amp;P 500 index.  So, essentially, you're talking about equity prices.  In my movements since the election are driven in an important way by the corporate tax reform, and that possibility alone could revalue the U.S. corporate anticipating that it may occur in 2017, but if not in 2017, then probably in 2018.  It is an issue on On the financial indexes are showing that conditions are easier than when we started our off of this view, the equity price expectation of sector by 10 to 15 percent, depending on how you do the calculation.  Markets are thinking that which the reigning party has a lot of conviction.

June 13-14, 2017

financial conditions index and compare it with what you'd see looking at it '90s or the 2000s or before the 2016 election, because during those periods you didn't corporate tax reform moving equity prices around.  In other eras, you might in equity prices and said, 'Well, this looks bubbly,' or 'This conditions,' but maybe that's not the right interpretation in this the FCI is necessarily signaling what it would have in interpreting it the way it's being interpreted around here as a increasing the policy rate. In my view, then, this particular period from November 2016 up until now is distorted when you look at the in the have the prospect of have looked at this kind of move looks like easing of financial particular instance.  So I don't think that the past, and I'd be careful about rationale for movements, we'd do better just to say that to equity price movements and give the arguments.  That's been a long-standing table here, certainly since the late '90s, and how to react to these situations and is something that the Committee has entertained many the Committee has been shy about using that as a for increasing the policy rate.  It's been shy about trying to take that out of the market. Also, I think if we want to react to equity price we want to react issue at the whether you've got unduly frothy markets times in the past.  However, I will say that rationale

turn to the price-level path of the U.S. economy.  Some of you know that, in In it, I price-level targeting for the United States.  In a lot of the New Keynesian models in monetary theory today, price-level targeting is optimal-something the staff we've looked at in the past.  The nice thing about price-level it in the data to see whether we're the price-level data and a price-level path. Let me 2012, I gave a speech called 'A Singular Achievement of Recent Monetary Policy.' talked about that are popular has emphasized, and something targeting being optimal is that you can actually go look at price-level targeting and, therefore, come to some kind of conclusion about whether U.S. monetary policy is optimal.  All you need are

June 13-14, 2017

the speech.  It's sensitive to when you start the price-level path, but I started think 1995 was the point when the Volcker-era disinflation ended and the informally targeting a 2 percent inflation rate for If you draw the price-level path since 1995 at a 2 percent pace, as of 2012 we that price-level path, and I called that 'a singular achievement' of U.S. because it meant that the Committee was behaving essentially like price-level Global Financial Crisis and all of the disruption from that, we had maintained the price-level path.  And, at least from the perspective monetary policy. I did that in it in 1995 because I Committee came to more or less a consensus of the United States. were actually right on monetary policy targeting would recommend.  Even through the that came of these kinds of models, that would be optimal to fall off the price-level path, and in recent talks that I've given.  We're about today, suggest that it look like we're going to get back to that price-level path any time soon and perhaps ever. 2 percent for some time to make up for the period in which concerned about this.  I had taken a lot of solace from the 2012 argument, Now, almost as soon as I gave that speech, we started it's now been five years.  I've looked at it again 4½ percent below that price-level path.  The forecasts that are available doesn't We're actually deviating from the 1995-2012 price-level path.  If you wanted to get back, you'd have to run inflation somewhat over we've run below.  I'm but now we've fallen off that path, and I am concerned about it.

forecast for inflation for 2017.  We're now longer to get back to our target than we anticipated, but we're of our tendency to do things on a calendar basis.  The data often do not cooperate with a day that is like that. Finally, on today's decision, I don't think it's a great day for the Committee.  I think we're in a situation where we've downgraded our saying it's going to take nevertheless going ahead with our rate rise plan.  This can be handled, but I do think it's a symptom us when we're trying to do things on a calendar basis, and I think today is

think it's fatal by any means, but it's just not as good as it could be.  I can today.  My main contention, however, is that the Committee path to raise the policy rate 200 basis points, in order to get to some continue to stress that I think we're in a slow-growth, low-inflation U.S. economy.  The current level of the policy is, in fact, about right if all you want to do is keep unemployment more or less where it is or perhaps moving up some toward our target.  I just don't these plans laying out the future in which we need 200 basis points or of increases in the policy rate in order to achieve our mandated goals.  Thank you, Madam I don't certainly go with 25 basis points does not need to be on a kind of neutral setting.  I regime.  This is how you should think about the rate and keep inflation close to our target think you need to have more Chair.

Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support the revised version of alternative context, though, of a patient and gradual approach to removing accommodation.  And I think this is also consistent with my own expectation that we should begin to allow the balance sheet to run off in September.  Obviously, I intend to carefully monitor upcoming developments rate of progress on employment and reaching our 2 percent inflation target. are four issues that I've the view that we should be gradually The question that I'm wrestling with is:  'What is neutral?'  I paid The first regards the neutral rate.  I've been of moving toward neutral.

the Laubach-Williams model, our own models at the Dallas Federal Reserve, other answer is, 'The neutral real rate today is around zero.'  Even though I've put an upward my SEP rate forecast for the next two or three years, I keep asking myself, 'Why? I'm not sure what factors will cause the neutral rate to drift up over the three years, and I'll keep asking that question. attention to models in the System-the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond model-which suggest to me that the slope into Why am I doing that?' next two or

My own experience is that stock market investors investors, for better or worse, tend to that they're worth The second thing I'm wrestling with-we flagged it yesterday, I don't need to go into it a lot more-is the wondering what the significance of and businesspeople tend to be bottoms-up.  Fixed-income be top-down macro investors, and the only thing I've learned over the years is paying attention to, even though they may be at odds with bottoms-up investors.

third issue I'm struggling with is, while the labor market is tight-and I believe and time, with a lag, this tight labor market will lead to wage to grips with what the implications of that are. The I've been saying that I think over pressure and then some price pressure-I also believe that the secular headwinds are very strong, and, in particular, I think the trend of technology-enabled disruption is becoming more intense and more powerful.  And I believe the forces that are limiting pricing power of businesses are strengthening.  I'm trying to come this issue about financial conditions, which I know is more forward leaning on the path of rates.  My I'm actually not overly swayed by strong financial conditions. reason why is that, on the basis of my experience, I know they can change overnight. other thing is, credit growth is contained or at least under control.  I think this is primarily And then the fourth issue for me is causing some to believe we should be a little bit own view is a little bit different. The biggest The

As long as the underlying growth and labor market fundamentals persist or worsen, and the Committee decides to slow the forgo a third rate increase than postpone a phaseout MR. POWELL.  In that will begin phasing out implementation increase in September and will raise the federal about as expected, and the labor fundamentals should exert upward pressure on prices, so that inflation should resume its gradual upward rise remain strong, I would be reluctant to take too much signal from short-term inflation readings.

Of course, many domestic and is probably that the economy has our intentions regarding policy rates. For me, the path of policy and provide a reason at the margin not to make path even more gradual.  As a number of others have noted, 18 months after the increase, we have tighter credit spreads, higher equity P/Es, a lower equity risk premium, lower long-term global factors affect financial conditions, and part of the story improved on a low-drama gradual path, and the Committee has been exceptionally transparent about way for this placid time to end would be a negative shock, as President might or might not leave any mark on the economy.  But the placid mood longer, with financial risks building, and it's not hard to see to very high asset prices and other forms of excess.  In fact, that's exactly what happened in the previous two cycles while inflation margin I do this to weigh in favor of moving ahead with our gradual rate increases.  Thank you. The natural Kaplan may have suggested, that would catch the market on the wrong foot and create short-term turmoil.  Such an event could also go on for quite a while that this environment, if it persists, could lead financial remained near 2 percent.

makes sense to me to initiate the balance sheet adjustment, as others have said, in according to plan, then I see December as a possibility that should be on an additional 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate.  However, I do realize my forecast could turn out to be too optimistic, so I may need to revisit some of my policy federal funds rate.  But, as Governor Powell just said, we should MR. HARKER.

Given my outlook, the progress on our mandate goals, and the risks associated with the the target range of the with the Chair's revisions, I think we should all remember associated with our inflation projections, which are now vividly illustrated in our I support releasing the details of our normalization plan at this meeting and indicating that this year.

By doing so over time we've been able to better align the path, but a gap the to emphasize the link between our outlook and our policy decision.  If this outlook does the funds rate is appropriate as part of the gradual I think the Committee has done a good job of changing the narrative.  Before, it was 'Wait until 'Continue on the gradual normalization path unless there is I think we should continue to emphasize this narrative. our policy as well as public's policy expectations with the Committee's anticipated policy rate remains, and we don't want it to widen.

The markets plan is implemented, but the reality that this is a gradual normalization is consistent with expectations should help avoid a longer-term negative reaction.  In view of Governor Fischer's remarks about the timing of the start of implementing Similarly, the Chair has toward normalizing the balance may still react when the that the uncertainty surrounding fiscal policy, I think our consistency should be welcomed by the public.  I agree with the normalization plan for the balance sheet.

timing to start the plan was interesting to me.  I was the details of the plan, as we plan to do today, and the timing information complications associated with triggering in September-the debt ceiling, report that isn't material for the outlook but that complicates to set up a trigger decision that would come at the July meeting.  Emphasizing that the very gradual can help. The discussion yesterday about the thinking of the decision to lay out and implementation as really being essentially one decision.  I think giving advance about the plan is very good, but too long a gap between presenting the plan and then triggering implementation would seem to add uncertainty, not subtract uncertainty.  Yesterday's discussion pointed out some budget talks, and perhaps a data communication.  So I think we should think seriously about July.  The Chair could use her July testimony plan is language to use when we do begin to implement balance sheet normalization.  We the balance sheet in subsequent meeting It isn't obvious.  Because we want the plan to be in the background, that may not referencing it in the statement after initialization.  On the other hand, we want the policy decisions, and balance sheet decisions are part of our Thinking ahead, the proposed language in paragraph 5 of alternative C seems like appropriate should also consider what we plan to say about statements. suggest statement to be transparent about our

Assuming no change in the outlook, I and cautious pace of reduction. MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B and the proposed language change that you've offered.  Today's decision continues the very gradual short-term rates, which Committee's approach to press conference, offer an important balance believe we should consider implementing this plan as early as the July meeting, having laid the groundwork for a very modest sheet over two to only a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate.  In addition, this equivalent and, in fact, may already be partially as they anticipate us ceasing reinvestments. Research by my staff estimates that a $675 billion reduction in the balance years is equivalent increase is likely to happen only gradually as we normalize priced in by markets

I support the aim to bring inflation back to 2 percent in a sustainable manner, or below our symmetric inflation target.  However, I remain regarding any policy choices that would deliberately target an undershoot of the an overshoot of our 2 percent inflation target in order to make up for past risk of continued inflation below target, including lower inflation our policy.  If we wait for Finally, regardless of whether we are above skeptical unemployment rate or misses.  I understand the expectations.  But the greater risk, in my view, is trying to fine-tune actual inflation at or above target, we risk having to raise rates more quickly, which could

The economy was creating a jobs, but there's little movement down in the headline unemployment rate.  We knew that a significant move downward in the headline unemployment rate, a move up in core move up in inflation expectations. MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I Today's vote was a tough call participation lot of had to end at some point, and indicators that it was reaching its eventual conclusion would include inflation, and/or a unemployment rate from 4.7 percent to increase rates in March.  That drop in the headline that we're getting closer to maximum employment, which same time, core inflation has essentially remain unchanged.  We don't yet that drop in core inflation is transitory.  In short, the economy is sending mixed tight labor market and weakening inflation. We have seen a meaningful drop in the headline 4.3 percent since the Committee last voted to unemployment rate suggested to me by itself would have supported an increase in rates today, but, at the also been dropping while inflation expectations know whether signals:  a

to raise rates came down to a tension between faith and Phillips curve.  A tight market should lead to competition for workers, which should lead to higher wages. For me, deciding whether or not data.  On one hand, intuitively, I am inclined to believe in the logic of the labor

June 13-14, 2017

those costs on to their customers, which should lead makes intuitive sense to me.  That's the 'faith' part.  Unfortunately, the this story, with the Committee coming up short of our inflation target for market is we should the recent drop in inflation is transitory. Eventually, firms will have to pass some of to higher inflation.  That data aren't supporting many years in a row now, and now core inflation actually falling even as the labor tightening.  If we base our outlook for inflation on these actual data, I don't believe raise rates today.

Raising rates will expectations drop, as we've seen in some other can be very, very challenging to bring them back up. If I'm torn between faith and data, management perspective.  The risk of raising rates too soon is of continuing to come up short of our inflation target.  And as Marie Gooding said at the previous believe further strengthen that belief.  And if inflation countries, it

We will move toward our target, and And if it leads to a modest overshoot of we have a symmetric target and not a The risk of inflation does start to I believe that we, as a Committee, will respond. 2 percent, that also shouldn't be concerning, because ceiling.

I I only real wake up one morning So what's the downside risk of waiting to see whether can only think of one really concerning downside risk-a sudden unanchoring of inflation expectations.  If inflation expectations start to slowly drift up, I'm not that concerned because believe we, as a Committee, will respond, and we will keep them in check.  The downside scenario is that we somehow break inflation expectations.  We

But this is a risk derived from faith and a sudden return of the risk that you can detect in financial markets or in survey data.  Because derived from faith and not data, it is a difficult risk to quantify. and instead of 2 percent, they jump to 4 percent.  We would have to respond very powerfully to re-anchor economic cost Phillips curve, and not a it is and 1970s, and they're not particularly useful to help us in 1967 and maintain aggressive monetary policy is that it seems that they put too much emphasis on curve, and they underappreciated the role of inflation expectations.  High I've looked at the 1960s understand this risk.  As I've looked at them, I see wages and inflation slowly climbing, with the FOMC lacking the conviction to bring inflation back down.  They cut rates, first then again in 1970, without having brought inflation back under control.  One reason why they didn't the Phillips unemployment would help bring inflation down, reducing the need for monetary policy to do its job.

In the 1970s, those mistakes based beliefs may be resulting in us raising rates too quickly and continuing to undershoot our inflation target.  I believe we should rely on the data to guide us, and that, to me, means we should wait whether toward our 2 percent target.

DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B with to paragraph 2.

In of the balance sheet normalization process, I expect that today's communication will work likely to begin to implement this plan. VICE CHAIRMAN your suggested changes meeting.  It's appropriate to put forth our balance sheet normalization plan.  It's put market participants on notice terms to pull forward somewhat expectations about when we're

September and December meeting in July and a little bit more than that for the After this meeting, I expect more of the probability mass will shift to to be gained the end of the year to start.  That said, I don't expect that there'll be much the absence of a scheduled press conference at that meeting. As was noted yesterday in the Desk briefing, in the dealer and buy-side surveys, most of the probability mass on timing has been split mainly between the meetings, with very little on our next October FOMC meeting. our September FOMC meeting.  After all, once we've indicated that we have agreement and have announced the details, market participants are likely to start to wonder what's by waiting until shifting of expectations to July, in

The amount of that would not be reinvested is quite small in the first quarter of can imagine circumstances in which appearances and psychology could be in our decision. One issue that deserves consideration is whether sheet normalization process could be influenced by the Congress's debt ideal world, we shouldn't be influenced by this, but if I'm not sure commencing balance attractive to us.  Substantively, I don't think it would make Treasury securities implementation, but I important.  So we might want to decide that these factors deserve some weight to wait and see how things evolve as we think pulling forward action to the July meeting of the debt limit debate, as this would be a surprise to market and presumably would be taken as a 'hawkish' signal.  People might interpret it that rate moves in September and December, which I think is inconsistent with the SEP, data that we got earlier today.  This would justify, in view of the growth pace and the fact that inflation is still well below our 2 percent objective. In considering the alternatives, I think it's best go into the September FOMC meeting.  I don't is attractive to get ahead participants the FOMC is moving the balance sheet normalization process to July so that it can potentially fit in two more and it's inconsistent, perhaps, with the inflation communicate an urgency to tighten that I think would be difficult to economy's

there are a number of better alternatives.  We can meeting that the timing of when the debt limit will bind does not pose a and announce at that meeting that the process will start on start date more later start date-say, November 1, as Or, if things look very confusing, we could even decide to wait until the December In thinking about alternatives, I think decide at the September problem for moving at that meeting October 1.  Alternatively, if we thought the debt limit made an October 1 problematic, we could announce in September but with a an example.
