Prefatory Note

This transcript has  been  produced from the original raw transcript in  the FOMC Secretariat's files. The Secretariat has lightly edited the original to facilitate the reader's understanding. Where one or  more words were  missed or  garbled in  the transcription, the  notation "unintelligible" has been inserted. In  some instances, words have been added in  brackets to  complete a  speaker's thought or to  correct an  obvious transcription error or  misstatement.

Errors undoubtedly remain. The  raw transcript was  not fully edited for  accuracy at the time it  was produced because it  was intended only as  an  aid to  the Secretariat in  preparing the record of the  Committee's policy actions. The  edited transcript has  not been reviewed by  present or  past members of the Committee. 5

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  We  now follow he t practice  f eleasing e  minutes f ur  meetings n  the  Friday fternoon  ollowing  he  next o r th o o o a f t meeting.

in  fact,   s he east  idely ead  of he eek. By the  time ewspapers  like he  Wall  Street it i t l w r t w n T Journal rrive  n  Monday, the  minutes  are ld ews. Frequently, ey re  not icked p at ll  r a o o n th a p u a o in  a  very udimentary  ay.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. There  is ne  technical oblem  relating  he iming. o pr tot t I would like  o  turn  o  Don Kohn merely  to aise  he  question. t t r t

MR.  KOHN. I  think  hursday  resolves  ur roblem.  Sometimes,  as  happened  when T o p President  oskow  raised    question  t he ast  eeting,  t  akes   while o  revise  he  minutes, M a a t l m i t a t t reproduce  hem,  and  then et he  copies ut  to he eserve  Banks so  that  hey re  available r t g t o t R t a fo release.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. A Thursday  release  ould  get he ress eports  nto  he w t p r i t Friday orning  papers? m

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. That  is ight.  y  letter  ggested    Wednesday r M su a release  r  a  Thursday elease  fter    two-day  meeting. f  e make it  onsistently  ursday, hat o r a a I w c Th t is  actually   improvement  on  my proposal. an

MR. KOHN. Particularly  nce he  minutes re  approved t he  beginning f he si t a a t o t Tuesday-Wednesday  meetings,  hen  presumably ny  problems  would  be  cleared  p  on  Tuesday, t a u so  a  Thursday elease  ould  work. r w

MR. BOEHNE.

My  feeling  s hat  ny  news media  that  ant i t a c make that  istinction  ll ind  he  minutes o  uninteresting  at  hey robably ill ot  carry d wi f t s th t p w n a report  n  them.

I  know we have  decided his  ssue, d  I  do  not ean to  say t i an m anything  o  change  the ecision.    had  some misgivings, d  they ave  just  een  heightened  y t d I an h b b this  onversation.    think  here  s   distinction   e  drawn  between  transparency d  seeking c I t i a tob an media  coverage,  nd  I m wondering  whether ur  discussion  f hese  iming uestions  ay not a a o o t t q m lead o  some confusion f he wo.  It eems  to e that  e are  being ransparent    releasing e t o t t s m w t by th minutes  and  having hem  available d  doing hem  the ay we do them.

We  do  not ave  that  any releases lating   our i ma h m re to policy ecisions  ecause  if  e tried  o  do  very any more,  I  think  e would  very  significantly d b w t m w restrict  e unctioning  his  ommittee.

MR. FISHER.  I  don't  ave  any  concrete  ense here ould  be  anything  ifferent h s t w d in what  we would do  every  day.  Maybe we would  have  to  intervene    little  re  than e do a mo w currently. development  that  ould ecome problematic, m hypothesizing,  uld  occur  if A c b I  a wo a critical  ss  of he ajor  banks  in  the ountry ere  all  o  become unbound. That  is,  hey ould ma t m c w t t w meet their quired  eeds  with ust  ault  ash.  If  very ne  of hese anks  were  over he  other e n j v c e o t b t side,  e might  have  a  very nteresting eral  unds  market.  But  I  remain  an  optimist w i fed f in believing  hat ome banks  are  still  ing o  be  operating  n he unds arket,  ven  if  t  s he t s go t i t f m e i i t smaller  anks,  nd  that  heir havior,  f  ll  his  ontinues  o appen  gradually,  uld  adjust  o b a t be i a t c t h wo t the  new conditions  nd  clearing uld  take lace. ll  of s  around  the able  now that  e do a wo p A u t k w not  need  required  eserves  o onduct ur  business.  e  can  run  the anking  system  on  a  bigger r t c o W b deficit  ust  p  to ero r  we can  be  filling   ith emporary perations. e  tools  re  very orj u z o inw t o Th a flexible.

MR. KOHN. Of  course,  ven  if  anks  do  not eed  any  required  eserve  alances t e b n r b a the  Reserve  Banks  at he  end  of he ay, hey eed  clearing lances  hrough he  day  and  at he t t d t n ba t t t end  of he  day.  So,  even  if  very ank  in  the ystem ere  unbound,   think here  ould  be  a t e b s w I t w

I t m le Pe It t r o c i We  have  been  pleasantly rprised at, th  this  radual ate  f hange, he  banks  have  adapted. su th wi g r o c t My  guess s  that  hey ill ontinue  o dapt,  s  Peter  ays,  s  long  as  the ate f hange  is ow. i t w c t a a s a r o c l But  there  ight  be  some level  t hich  the learing eds  are  the perative  eeds ather  han he m a w c ne o n r t t reserve  eeds.

MR. HOENIG. Mike or  Ted,  I  have  a  question  n  your il rice  omments.

MR. TRUMAN. I  think here  re wo  aspects  o  your uestion.  One would  relate t a t t q to the  short  erm,  eaning  the eriod  e are ooking t ere, nd  the ther ould  be  a  longer-term t m p w l a h a o w perspective.

MS. MINEHAN. I  have  a  couple f uestions,  ke,  following  p  on  what  President o q Mi u Stern as talking  bout n  terms f roductivity  sumptions.  ou have  a  discussion  he w a i o p as Y int Greenbook about   change  in  your  thinking  bout  the rend  ate  n roductivity  owth.

I on't  isagree  t ll  ith  the gr i d d d a a w

trend n  your  overall recast.  just  onder how those hanges  came about  and  whether hey  are i fo I w c t reflective    something ifferent   our  thinking  ecently. of d iny r

MR.  PRELL.  We  aren't rtain  nd  I  don't  ee  how anyone  really  ould e  in  this ce a s c b area. e  had  clung  with  great  etermination  he ssumption hat  he  underlying  rowth  trend W d tot a t t g in  this  ecade  would  prove  to e  1.1  percent.  e  have  been  continuing  o eassess  his d b W t r t assumption,  nd  I  guess articularly ause  this  eeting  is ne  of hose hen a  longer-run a p bec m o t w perspective y be  important  o  the ommittee's eliberations,  took  another  ard  look t  it. ma t C d we h a What we perceived  as that    trend  ine  ell elow  our  1.1  percent  rowth  assumption learly w a l w b g c would  fit  n   more natural y what  we had  been  experiencing   through t east  he hird i a wa up a l t t quarter  f ast  ear. he historical tern  s hat  roductivity  nds o  be  above  the rend  n  level o l y T pat i t p te t t i terms  until  lmost he  end  of n  expansion,  f  ot ll he  way to he  end  of he xpansion,  nd  it a t a i n a t t t e a then  dips own below  trend uring   recession  nd  the arly  ecovery  hase  and  subsequently d d a a e r p moves back  up.  What we found  is hat,  ith  a 1.1  percent  rend ine,  were  well elow  that t w t l we b trend  ine  ow and  have  been  for   while  even  though he xpansion as  not ome to  an  end. l n a t e h c That ust  id  not it. omething  like  7  percent  ave  a  picture  hat  ooked ore like  he ecent j d f S . g t l m t r history.  ow, there ay be  reasons hy earlier  storical  tterns uld  not old his  ime.  The N m w hi pa wo h t t adjustments  f  labor  o  output  n he hort  un  may be  different,   so  on.  But, hen the o t i t s r and w divergence  ersists er  several  ears,  hat  s   troubling ttern. p ov y t i a pa

We  also  oted hat  here  ere  reasons  o  think  hat  utput,  nd  thus roductivity, n t t w t t o a p may have  been  underestimated er  the ast  ew  years.  The question  s ow much. One could ook ov l f i h l at  the ifference tween  gross omestic ncome  and  gross omestic roduct--a fference at d be d i d p di th has  become quite  izable--and  nclude hat  roduction  eally s  been  much stronger  han he s co t p r ha t t data uggest nd  productivity  eatly  nderstated.  ut  looking t he istory  f evisions d s a gr u B a t h o r an

what  little   know about hat  might  be  the  flaws n he ncome-product  ata,  e thought hat we w i t i d w t was a  rather  ggressive  ssumption bout hat  true utput  nd  productivity  d  been.  So we in  a a a a w o a ha sense  compromised. We  did  assume  that  he rend  n  actual  evels  f roductivity  s  been t t i l o p ha understated   recent  ears,  ut nly y  enough  for s  to  try  o  square hings  y  assuming  about in y b o b u t t b .9  percent  rend rowth  in  productivity.  e  fourth-quarter ber actually  easonably  elpful t g Th num isr h in  getting    picture at  ooks ensible th hat  ind  of rend  ine. ow, this  ould  naturally a th l s wi t k t l N w feed hrough o  our  potential tput ssumption, t  there  re  offsetting  nsiderations.  en t t ou a bu a co Wh we looked  at he rends  n  the verage orkweek and  the actors  hat  et s  from  nonfarm t t i a w f t g u business  utput o  GDP  and  so  on, e were  led o  conclude hat  n  estimate  f bout  1.9  percent o t w t t a o a for he  period  ince 990  still oked retty  ood. So,  we have  not  changed  our  potential  tput t s 1 lo p g ou trend;  t  s till  out  1.9 ercent  er ear,  hain-weighted  a  1992  base. i i s ab p p y c on

MS. MINEHAN. Just  o ollow p  on that: he  lower  trend  ate f roductivity t f u T r o p growth, hen,  as  been  consistent    your  mind  with here  we are n  an  unemployment basis  nd t h in w o a where  we are n a  change-in-inflation  is. o bas

MR. PRELL.  That  was another actor.  e  looked  at kun's  Law.  It as  worked f W O h pretty  ell. w

MS. MINEHAN. Okay.

MR. PRELL.  It oes  not  in  itself  ggest hat  utput  rowth  has  been  a  lot  ore  rapid d su t o g m than easured.  That  also ives ne  pause  because,  hile  Okun's  Law is ot   relationship m g o w n a one can  depend  on  from  quarter  o uarter  r  even  year o ear,  ver xtended eriods  t  orks  pretty t q o t y o e p i w well.  So,  that  ave  us  some pause  as  to hether e should aintain he eemingly ptimistic g w w m t s o view  that  he roductivity  end  as 1.1  percent.  aving  to  adjust  hat  rend,  e also djusted t p tr w H t t w a

our  sights  n  what  actual  roductivity  owth  would  be  over  1997-1998, nd  that  s ow  we o p gr a i h formulated  ur  forecast. o

We  hear hat    number of lants  n hese ndustries  e perating  ear ull a t a p i t i ar o n f capacity.

Labor  market  conditions,    seems  to e  the ase lsewhere,  ave  not  eased t ll  n as b c e h a a i our  region s  far  s  we can  tell. eports f ising ges and  prices--and  is  s here  our a a R o r wa th i w information  ay differ    little  om  some things  hat  ther  olks  ave  said--while  rtainly  t m a fr t o f h ce no universal  re ore widespread ow than hey  have  been  in  the ast  everal  onths.

On the anufacturing  ide,  trong oreign  ompetition  s till  eping extile  kers m s s f c i s ke t ma and  metal roducers  rom  passing  long  increases   wages  and  the ost f asic aterials.  ut p f a in c o b m B in  some other  ndustries--notably iture d  paper,  lectrical ipment,  nd  machinery--we i furn an e equ a get eports  hat  ome of hese  ompanies  are  now able o ass long  their  age and  other  ost r t s t c t p a w c increases  ore easily  han  had  been  the ase  in rior  onths.

Turning  to he  national cture, e rojections   submitted  re  fairly ose o  those t pi th p we a cl t in  the reenbook, ut  we got here  y  a  different  ute. et e quickly  xplain  hat.  e  used  a G b t b ro L m e t W small  VAR model in  developing  ur  projections.  en  we initially erated  rojections  der o Wh gen p un the  assumption f o  change  in onetary  policy, e  result s  an  increase  n he PI  to  a  rate o n m th wa i t C above  3 percent  his  ear nd  next ear espite  he  likelihood  ome diminution  n  energy rice t y a y d t ofs i p pressures  ver his  eriod. o,  we then edeveloped  ur  projection   the ssumption hat  he o t p S r o on a t t Committee  will ake hatever olicy  ctions  eem to  be  required  o old he PI at r elow  3 t w p a s t h t C o b percent,  tarting   he  period  mmediately head.  In  our  particular el  this  equires  n s int i a mod r a increase  n  the unds ate  f bout  50  basis  oints  arly  n.  The main  point   want  to ake here, i f r o a p e o I m though, nd  I  am trying  o espond o  the oint  hat  erry  ordan entioned  earlier,   hat  ur  3 a t r t p t J J m ist o percent  PI  projection   ot ust  n  unconditional  recast t  a  projected  esult r he ear C isn j a fo bu r fo t y ahead.

With  respect  o  the reenbook  itself, ve  to ay  that  he  general  ontour f he t G I  ha s t c o t Greenbook  projection oubles  e a  little.   hows  the ore PI  rising   about -1/4 ercent  n tr m Its c C to 3 p i 1998. As I  think omeone else as  already  entioned,  he ate ould  rise  o  about  3-1/2 ercent s h m t r w t p except or he  technical justments  y  the LS.  Moreover, he  language f he  Greenbook, s  I f t ad b B t o t a

They have  not  articulated  e p w t h t w th reasons  hy they ave  been  unwilling  o  pay  those ages.

As far s  the ational onomy is oncerned,    do  think  he  growth  of he eal a n ec c I t t r economy will low  to  trend  n  1997.  From my perspective,  wever, hat  s erhaps ot  as s i ho t i p n favorable  n  outcome  as  it  eems  because y suspicion  s hat  ggregate  emand will ontinue  o a s m i t a d c t rise  ore  rapidly  han rend.    have  what  is ssentially  upply-constrained ecast. at  is, m t t I e a  s for Th I

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Kelley.

MR. KELLEY. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  In  the idst f he normous  plethora  f m o t e o data nd  impressions  hat  ne  is ubjected  o,    have  been  asking yself hat  developments ver a t o s t I m w o the ecent  ast eem  to  be  significant.  ould  like  o ist x hings--three   hem  because hey r p s I  w t l si t oft t are oving and  three  ecause hey  are ot. m b t n

First  re he  three  hat  eem  to  me to e  moving,  and  I  would have  to ut age a t t s b p w pressures  t he op  of hat  ist.  eems  clear  hat  hose ressures  re resent  nd  probably  re a t t t l Its t t p a p a a strengthening    time oes  along.  Where that  s eally  mportant  s n  what  it  mplies  or nit as g i r i i i i f u labor osts,  nd  I  on't  hink  hat  s uite  s  clear.    would  like  o  know how many stories ke c a d t t i q a I t li

are  out here.    particularly e  hat xample  because   once  ran lastic ldings t I lik t e I p mo plants  nd  I nderstand  hem.  I  don't  now how widespread hat  s nd  I  don't  now how a u t k t i a k productivity  d  these  age pressures terface,  t hat  s   very  powerful nput,  hatever t  s, an w in bu t i a i w i i and  it oes  seem  to e  moving in he irection  ore pressure. d b t d ofm

The second  thing s he  fourth-quarter , particularly   message  there  hat  he i t GDP the t t consumer  is ack.  The  question  s hether  this  trength   consumer  spending s oing  to  hold b i w s in i g up  and  be  long-lasting    whether t  s  ust  emporary nd  will ollow he  saw-tooth  attern  hat or i i j t a f t p t we have  become familiar th  throughout  his  xpansion. ere  again,   hink  e have  a  very wi t e H It w powerful  force,  ut ne  that  t his  oint  eems  to e to e  completely  nscrutable.  nsumer b o a t p s m b i Co confidence, e  wealth ffect, d  job ormations  eem  to  indicate at  t  ight  have  staying th e an f s th i m power.  On the  other  and  we have  the igh  level  f onsumer  debt nd  a  question  s  to hether h h o c a a w or ot  there xists    great  eal f ent-up emand. Those  questions  ould  indicate  hat  DP n e a d o p d w t G growth  might  fade ack  to  a  sustainable  te.  f ome of he upporting  actors  tart   go  away, b ra I s t s f s o like  he ealth ffect  hrough   stock arket  break, onsumer  expenditures  ould  actually de  to t w e t a m c c fa less  han  a  sustainable  vel  nd  could ecome a  possibly  erious  ownside  risk  t ome point. t le a b s d a s

The third  hing s he ecent  ovement of he  dollar.  s we know,  the  stronger  ollar t i t r m t A d should end o  weaken exports.  t lso hould end  to old  inflation   heck. t t I a s t h inc

There  are hree  mportant  hings  hat  o  not  appear o  me to  moving  much. I  would t i t t d t mention  first e arge  umber of nflation  dices.  e  are  all  ocused n  the PI;  we have  been th l n i in W f o C talking  bout t    lot, t t  s ot ecessarily  at  ypical. ere  are any other  rice ndices  hat a i a bu i i n n th t Th m p i t are ot  moving up and  indeed   number that  re  moving  down. Now, that  s ot  determinative n a a i n in and  of tself  cause he  Committee  has  worked  ahead  of hose eries  n  the ast,  nd  I m sure t i be t t s i p a a i will gain.  I  think  t  s ignificant t  ubdued  inflation  s  been  the rend or any quarters a i i s tha s ha t f m

now. It as  persisted    the ace f hat  we have  regarded ver  some long eriod f ime  as h in f o w o p o t being  considerable ward  pressure, d  yet  inflation    these easures  still  ays  retty  uch up an by m st p m the  same. This  raises    lot  f uestions   my mind about hat  may be  going n  in  the conomy, a o q in w o e and  I ould  love o  get ome answers  somehow.  I  don't  now if  e will. w t s k w

Another  thing hat  oes  not eem to e  changing uch is hat  o  new driving  orces t d s b m t n f appear  to e  emerging.  There  are o  new engines  hat  eem likely   push  the conomy toward b n t s to e either  onsistent rength  r  weakness.  We  seem  to e  enjoying  n  extended tay n  the c st o b a s o mountain  top  that  overnor  Meyer mentioned  a  week or  two  ago, nd  who knows how long hat G a t may last.

Lastly,  t  oes  not eem to  me that  e have  much pressure  n  capacity  tilization, i d s w o u and without  hat   onder how much inflationary ssure  s ikely  o merge in he  economy. My t Iw pre i l t e t bottom  line  s hat    am very ervous bout  what  may be  happening s  a  result  he ight  abor i t I n a a oft t l markets  and  the ssociated ge pressures.  t  the  end  of he ay  that  ay be  more important a wa A t d m than he  other ive actors  r nything lse.  n enormously mportant  uestion  n  my mind is he t f f o a e A i q i t enigma  of he  consumer.  I  guess e will  ust  ave  to ait nd  see  how much that  otential t w j h w a p strength ays here.  ll  in  all,    continue  o hink hat  t  akes sense o ait nd  see. st t A I t t t i m t w a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Phillips.

MS. PHILLIPS.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  As almost verybody as  mentioned, he e h t economy ended 1996 on a  strong  ote.  The  question  ow is hether  this  s ust    single  urst  f n n w i j a b o energy  and  the conomy is bout  to  settle  wn to he roverbial stainable  th,  r  does  this e a do t p su pa o burst  f nergy  portend   stronger owth  path hat  ill train sources  nd  lead o  inflationary o e a gr t w s re a t pressures.    think  here  s   corollary estion  elating  he igh evel f conomic  activity I t i a qu r tot h l o e at year-end,  amely  that  ven  if  he conomy does  return  o  a  sustainable  owth  path,  ill e be n e t e t gr w w

seeing ressures  ecause he conomy is perating  t  such  a  high evel, us training sources. p b t e o a l th s re During  the urrent  xpansion,  hich  is ow in  its  ixth  ear,  e have  had  several  f hese trong c e w n s y w o t s growth  episodes  nd  it  s robably  air  o  say  that  onetary  policy  as  had  a  lot  o  do  with hese a i p f t m h t t above-trend  ursts, rticularly ough t  least  he  first lf  f 996. So,  it  s p  to s  to  make b pa thr a t ha o 1 i u u some kind  of ssessment f he urrent  ptick  n  economic  growth. a o t c u i

Most forecasters  ve  been  looking  o  a  slackening  f usiness  nvestment. ha t o b i Many businesses  robably lso ecently panded  capacity  nd  replaced  quipment.  So,  it  s p a r ex a e i questionable   to ow long e are  going  to  see  large  ncreases  usiness  nvestment. as h w i inb i I suppose  that  omputers nd  communications quipment  are he xception.  hey seem to  involve c a e t e T a  bottomless  pending it.  gain, pending n his  rea hould t east   adequate o  keep  us  on s p A s i t a s a l be t a  sustainable  owth  path.  On the ther  and, iscal licy  s ikely  e  a  bit f   constraint. gr o h f po i l tob o a

Having  bought  into  he rguments  for   slackening  f rowth  going  forward,  et  e t a a o g l m hasten o  point  ut  that  here  o  remain  some significant as f trength  n he conomy and t o t d are o s i t e there ay be  some room for urprises. rst  f ll,  he abor arket  continues  trong.  Even if m s Fi o a t l m s

we do  not  get o  that   percent  nemployment rate  orecast   the reenbook,  it  s till trong t 5 u f in G i s a  s market.  Although  some households ay be  constrained   their  ersonal  ebt evels,   eems m by p d l it s reasonable  o  expect onsumption o  continue  t   level  t east  n tep ith  income  growth.  In t c t a a a l i s w view  of he trength  f ncome  of ate,  onsumer  spending ould  feasibly eate  nanticipated t s o i l c c cr u demands. I  think onfidence  easures  support  his  cenario. c m t s

In  another rea,  usiness  nvestment  as  been  a  consistent rprise ring his a b i h su du t expansion nd  consistently  derestimated. e same fundamentals  hat  rought hese urprises a un Th t b t s could  still    present. hese  include  trong  rofits d  cash  flows,  he ow  cost f apital, be T s p an t l o c a ready  availability redit, lling mputer  and  communications  equipment rices, d  the of  c fa co p an emphasis  on  efficiency d  productivity  at  as  inspired  number of irms o ontinue  o nvest. an th h a f t c t i

The stock arket  is nother  rea here  we always  have  to  say  that  here s oom for m a a w t i r surprises. ther  e have  an  irrationally  berant  arket  or  it  s undamentally  riven. o Ei w exu m i f d N matter hat  the  verdict, ther uld rovide ontinued  ources f nvestment  unding or irms w ei co p c s o i f f f and  the ealth ffect  hould ontinue  o  support  onsumer  spending. w e s c t c

Where does  all f his  eave s  with espect  o  inflation?  lthough ecently  t  as o t l u r t A r i h been  benign,  t  s ard  to elieve  hat  e can  continue  o njoy his  oldilocks, st-right i i h b t w t e t G ju economy forever  ithout  eeling  nflation  essures.  age  pressures  lready  re  being eported w f i pr W a a r anecdotally  nd  are  showing  up  in age and  compensation tatistics. efit  ost  onstraints a w s Ben c c may have  run  their urse.

In  sum,  I  think  he rguments or   return  o  a  sustainable  end evel f DP  growth t a f a t tr l o G are  fairly rsuasive, t here re  reasons o elieve  hat  he robabilities  stronger  rowth pe bu t a t b t t p of g accompanied  by  building  rice  ressures e  increasing. p p ar

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Meyer,  you  are  the leanup itter. c h

MR. MEYER. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  The fourth-quarter   report  arks  an GDP m extraordinary  d  to  an  extraordinary  ar.  The defining  eature  f oth he ourth  uarter  nd en ye f o b t f q a the ear  as  a  whole  was  a  pleasing  ombination f igher-than-expected wth  and  lowery c o h gro than-expected  nflation, luding  eclines  n  core easures  of nflation.  w  did  we do  it nd i inc d i m i Ho a can  we do  it  gain?  Three  developments  hink ontributed portantly  he xtraordinary a It c im tot e performance ast  ear. l y

First,  sharp ebound  in  the articipation e nd  hence  in  labor orce rowth a r p rat a f g prevented he trong utput rowth  from  pushing he nemployment  rate ven  lower  and  thereby t s o g t u e pressuring flation.  econd,   coincidence  f hat  I  would  refer  o  as  positive pply hocks, in S a o w t su s including  he  further  lowing n  the ate  f ncrease  n enefit sts, e  decline  n  nominal t s i r o i i b co th i import rices, d  the  sharper-than-normal  cline  n omputer  prices  ollectively trained p an de i c c res core  measures f  inflation.  d third, e evel  f AIRU o An th l o N may have  declined  r  at east  e o l w came to  recognize  uring ast  ear hat  AIRU d l y t N had  recently clined  rom  its  verage evel  ver de f a l o the ast  ecade. l d

The message  here s hat  hile e should ertainly lebrate st  ear's  emarkable i t w w c ce la y r performance,  e should ot  expect o  repeat  t.  Growth must  now slow  or he isk  o nflation w n t i t r t i will ecome unacceptable.  rue,   came with  this  essage  last  uly,  ut ow I  really  ean it. b T I m J b n m

[Laughter]  I  also aid hen hat  ven  if  rowth  slows  to rend,  here  ill emain  an  inflation k s t t e g t t w r ris from  the revailing  w  unemployment rate. till,  e mmediate  prospects  re or    benign p lo S th i a f a economy in  the  near erm, ssuming, f ourse,    significant  owing n  growth  and  thanks n t a o c a sl i i part o  inertia    the nflation  ocess  nd  a  projected versal  ast  ear's  ecline  n  oil  rices. t in i pr a re ofl y d i p I am still    the amp of hose ho firmly  xpect   decline  n il rices. in c t w e a i o p

The unexpected trength  f ourth-quarter wth  does, owever,  put ack  into he s o f g o h b t picture  hat  I  have  referred   as  the rowth  risk  n he utlook--the sk  hat  oing orward w to g i t o ri t g f growth  will emain  above  trend nd  push  utilization  es  ven  higher  eginning  rom  a  level r a rat e b f already  t r  beyond  capacity.  o be  sure,  he rowth  in  several  omponents  of DP  in  the a o T t g c G fourth  uarter, ecifically  consumer  services, nresidential  ructures,   exports, q sp in no st and is unsustainable,   there  s ittle  ubt hat  he xpansion ill low  as  a  result   the irst arter. and i l do t t e w s in f qu

The surge n  net xports,  he ost  important  ontributor    the ourth-quarter wth  spurt, i e t m c to f g o in my judgment  reflects  portantly  he esidual  easonality    that  omponent.  But  this  eans that im t r s in c m the  sharp ebound  in et xports  osted  n  the  fourth  uarter  ore likely curred  ore  evenly r n e p i q m oc m over  the ntire  ear. he bottom  line  s hat  lthough  he ourth-quarter wth  rate  ay be e y T i t a t f gro m biased pward,  the  growth  over he ntire  ear s ot. u t e y i n

In  light  f he ikelihood at  everal  omponents  of DP  posted nsustainable  urts o t l th s c G u sp in  the ourth  uarter, m comfortable  ith  the  staff recast at  rowth  is ikely  low  to  near f q I  a w o h g l tos 2  percent  r ven  below  in  the irst arter.  till,  at  happens  in he irst arter  s ot he ey o e f qu S wh t f qu i n t k to  the orecast.  fter ll,  rowth  over  1996  proved  unusually  ouncy--2 ercent  n he irst f A a g b p i t f quarter, 7  percent  n he  second,  ack  to .1  percent  n hird, en ack  to .7 ercent  n he 4. i t b 2 i t th b 4 p i t fourth.  everting ack  to   percent  n he  current  uarter  ill ot, herefore,  ttle e igger R b 2 i t q w n t se th b question:  hat happened  to  the  second alf  lowdown and  how confident  re e that  he W h s a w t

economy will low  over  1997?  If  e could orrect  or he esidual  easonality    net xports, s w c f t r s in e we might  actually e  the econd-half owdown. At  any  rate,  s  my former  partners  t se s sl a a Macroeconomics Advisers ave  noted n  their  ost  recent  eekly  commentary,  the  second-half h i m w slowdown is vident  n  a  variety  f easures  of conomic  performance ot  directly  lluted  y e i o m e n po b net  exports--for  ample, ndustrial  oduction, yroll  mployment,  aggregate  ours  worked, ex i pr pa e h light  ehicle  ales, using tarts,  rsonal  onsumption xpenditures,  al ross omestic v s ho s pe c e re g d purchases,  nd  real inal  ales  o  domestic urchasers. a f s t p

On balance,  herefore, till  ew  the  economy as  having  slowed  over he econd  half t I  s vi t s of  1996 and  this  elps e to e  comfortable  ith  a  forecast  f   further owing o  a  2  to  2-1/2 h m b w o a sl t percent  ate  ver  1997.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Good morning, veryone.  Brian  Madigan,  would  you e start   off,  lease? us p

MR. MADIGAN. Certainly,  .  Chairman.  I  will  e  referring   he ackage  labeled, Mr b tot p "Material  or taff  riefing  n  Annual Ranges." [Statement--see  pendix.] f S B o Ap

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions or rian? f B

MR.  JORDAN. Brian, f  e were  to  have  a  multiyear  orizon s  our  objective r i w h a fo getting  o rice tability,  haps long  the  lines  f he rice tability ernative   hart   of he t p s per a o t p s alt inc 2 t Bluebook, oney growth  would  be  slower n  that  nvironment,  ased  on  current  elationships. m i e b r Whether  inflation, perly  easured, s   percent  r  3 percent,  do  not now. We  know there pro m i 2 o we k are  measurement  errors  hat  ffect  he  implicit  ice eflator  d  other  rice  ndexes,  ut he t a t pr d an p i b t answer  is oing  to e  2 or  3  percent.  ased  on  the nformation  ou  have  now,  whatever g b B i y assumption ou  make about  own price  nd  the  evidence bout ow the  Treasury ield urve y a a h y c behaves  relative  he  funds ate,  ow confident  an  you be  that  f  e maintain   5-1/4 ercent tot r h c i w a p funds  rate,  here ill ot e  a  deceleration  2  growth  consistent th  a  policy  f oving to t w n b ofM wi o m price tability? s

MR. MADIGAN. Given  our  methodology  for orecasting,  hink hat  eally  s f I  t t r i a question  bout ow confident  e are  that  ominal  GDP  growth  would  behave  as  projected  he a h w n int Greenbook.  We  forecast ney demand by  looking  t  growth  rates  f ominal  GDP, making  an mo a o n adjustment  or rojected  ovements in  opportunity sts  onsistent th  any  changes  in  interest f p m co c wi rates.  bviously,  he taff uld  be  wrong,  and  one  source f rror  n  projecting ney demand O t s co o e i mo or  money growth  would  be  our  assessment  f he ikely  rowth  in ominal  GDP  that  ould  be o t l g n w consistent  th  a  5-1/4 ercent  unds ate. nother  source ould  be  errors  n rojecting ney wi p f r A w i p mo

demand itself, en  a  forecast r ominal  GDP  and  interest  tes.  learly,  are  still  ry giv fo n ra C we ve uncertain  t his  oint  n  that  core. a t p o s

MR.  JORDAN. But  we can  distinguish  ong forecasts  f ominal  GDP.  We  do  not am o n target  ominal  GDP, but ou  can  say here s n  implicit minal  GDP  target  f  ou  have  a  price n y t i a no i y stability  jective.  f  ou  say our  objective  o  get ominal  GDP  growth  down to he rea f ob I y y ist n t a o 2 to  3  percent  nd  if ur  analytical  amework  tells u  that  2  growth  also ould  be  around  2  to a yo fr yo M w 3  percent, en  you  can  at east  un  the ntellectual rcise  s  to hat  kind  f nterest  te  ath th l r i exe a w o i ra p would  be  consistent  th  producing hat  utcome.  In  Gary  Stem's ords  yesterday,   e have  a wi t o w if w supply-constrained  onomy,  then o  get o  price tability  r ask s o onstrain minal ec t t s ou t i t c o demand growth  to  a  rate  onsistent th  that  ggregate  upply rowth. c wi a s g

MR.  MADIGAN. Yes. Certainly  n  the teady tate,   ou  will,  hen price  tability i s s if y w s is chieved e would not  see  a  5-1/4 ercent  ominal  federal  unds ate  s  consistent  th  that a w p n f r a wi outcome. I  guess  the  question  elates rtly  o  what  federal  unds ate ath ill  ake s  to r pa t f r p w t u a steady tate  ith  price tability. rt   in  the luebook  presented  ne  scenario  here  we gave s w s Cha 2 B o w what  we consider  o  be  our est hot t  projecting  at  ort f nterest  te  ath. hat  involved, t b s a th s o i ra p T as  you  know,  a  considerable crease  n he ominal  and  real  ederal  unds ates  ver he ext in i t n f f r o t n year r  two and  then  a  reduction  n  the ominal  funds ate  s  inflation  me down. o i n r a ca

MR. JORDAN. Okay,  but  chart    was developed ithin he AIRU 2 w t N framework  and the  assumption hat  e know where  the AIRU t w N is nd  where  the urrent  ate f nemployment a c r o u is elative    it.    am asking ou  to hink hrough he xercise  or s  and  abstract om  that. r to I y t t t e f u fr Have you  or  can  you  simply un  through hose nterest  te  lternatives sented  n hart    and, r t i ra a pre i c 2 based  on  the tatistical  ationships   money demand-opportunity  ost ramework, race  ut s rel in  a c f t o what  kind f oney growth  would  be  produced?  That  is ust  n  exercise. o m j a

MR. KOHN. I  guess   am a  little  clear  bout hat  you  are roposing,  resident I un a w p P Jordan.  In  the taffs ew, ou would  have  to  raise  nterest  tes  onsiderably    get he ower s vi y i ra c to t l nominal  GDP  growth  that  ou  want.  If  ou  are sking  s  what  would  happen  if  ypothetically y y a u h nominal  GDP  simply ecelerated th he  funds ate  eing eld  at  5-1/4 ercent,  bviously d wi t r b h p o money growth  would  come in  lower.  That  I  agree s n  arithmetic oblem hat  e could olve. i a pr t w s If  we were  to  raise  nterest  tes  s  in he hart   case,  oney growth as  Brian aid ould  come i ra a t c 2 m s w in  even  lower ecause  we would  be  moving  along he oney demand function  t he  same time. b t m a t

MR. JORDAN. Okay. We  have  run  the xercise  t  our ank where, f  e take our e a B i w y price tability  th  and  those elated terest  te ovements that  e can  pick ff f hart  ,  we s pa r in ra m w o o c 2 produce  an  M2  growth  of  about  1 r  2  percent  n bout  3 or   years. o i a 4

MR.  KOHN. That  is otally ausible   me, given hat  e had  3-1/2 r  3-3/4 ercent t pl to t w o p M2  growth  associated th  the maller  ncrease  n he ederal  unds ate  n  the table  nflation wi s i i t f f r i s i alternative.  ,  lower  M2  growth  could ell e  associated th hose igher  nterest  tes. So w b wi t h i ra

MR. PARRY. I  think hat  he luebook  with  these  lternatives   very  helpful  his t t B a was t time.  Certainly,   rovided   great eal f nformation  bout  some of he ssues  hat  ere  raised itp a d o i a t i t w in  previous  eetings nd  that  e clearly e  interested  .  Don,  there  s ne  thing  hat    wanted m a w ar in i o t I to  ask bout hart  . In  calculating  e eal  ate f nterest,  u  used  the CE  excluding  nergy. a c 2 th r r o i yo P e I  know  you  cannot e  completely  omfortable  ith  that  easure  because f he ind  of eal  ates b c w m o t k r r that  t  roduces,  articularly he resent  ime.  The  surveys,  f ourse,  ndicate pectations i p p at t p t o c i x of about  3  percent  nflation  e  year head.  Do you  have  any  comments about ome alternative i on a s price  easure  that  ould  be  a  better proach o eal  ates  han his  CE  measure?  I  ask  because m w ap t r r t t P I  think  hat  easure  is ery isleading? t m v m

MR. KOHN. I  agree  and  we tried   convey  that  oint n   long,  omplex  footnote. to p i a c Maybe it as  hard  to ead hrough.   will  e  covering t  n  my briefing   well, resident rry. w r t I b i i as P Pa MR. PARRY. Okay.

MR. KOHN. But  I  agree ith  you.  I hink  hat  t  s ery ikely at  eople,  n orming w t t i i v l th p i f their  rice  xpectations,  ok t he hole  array f rices  hat  hey re aying nd  not ust  t he p e lo a t w o p t t a p a j a t core easures.  To  us, he ore  PCE was a  little  re  revealing  f he nderlying  ense f hat m t c mo o t u s o w was  happening  to nflation,   it  bstracted om  CPI  measurement  changes  and  related i and a fr problems.  So,  the ore CE was better om  that  erspective,  t  I  agree hat  t  verstates e c P fr p bu t i o th decline  n  real  ates  n  1997. If  ou  use otal E, you  see hat  eal ates  ctually ange  very i r i y t PC t r r a ch little    1997. Indeed,  hey ise    little ause f he ssumed  decline  n  energy rices, ich in t r a bec o t a i p wh depresses  otal  CE  or otal  PI.  Real  rates  ould  then o  down in  1998 as  the otal  CE  starts t P t C w g t P to  trend  p  again. ut  in  1997,  it  ooks s  if  eal  ates  ctually se    tick,    ou  just  iterally u B l a r r a ri a if y l use the  total  CE rather  han he ore  PCE. P t t c

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Any further  uestions  or  rian?  If  ot,  et  e start f q f B n l m of by  saying hat    do  not  see  any  significant nge  from  the ilemma  we have  had  in ecent t I cha d r meetings  on  these  onger-run  bjectives. ould  stick    little  sh  next o he  tree  n rian's l o I  w a bu t t i B chart  o  reverse  he attern  lightly. aughter] he moment that  e alter  he  long-term  anges, t t p s [L T w t r we are  effectively  ying hat  2  is ack  in lay. e  then ave  to  start   evaluate  ow the sa t M b p W h o h markets  will  espond o  what  we are  saying. f  e go  to  Bluebook  alternative  ,  hich  implies r t I w IIw the  monetary  aggregates  re ack  in  play,  hat  aises e uestion  f hether e are illing  o a b t r th q o w w w t sanction  hat  amounts  to  nominal  GDP  growth  of erhaps   percent  ith  the mplications at w p 6 w i th has  for rices.    seriously estion  hether e would  gain  anything f alue n  monetary  policy p I qu w w o v i debates.

MR. MEYER. Could  I ust  aise    question, .  Chairman?  When  you  indicated at j r a Mr th a  2  to   percent  2  range ould  be  viewed  as  sanctioning  percent  ominal  income growth, 6 M w 6 n I was a  little  rprised.  ould you  say  that,  onsistent  th he ay these anges ave  been  used su W c wi t w r h in  the ast,  t  ould  take n  increase  n oney  growth  above  the ange o ustify ightening p i w a i m r t j a  t of policy?

MR. BROADDUS. Mr.  Chairman,   agree  with  your nalysis  egarding  2, and  I I a r M would  favor lternative  retty  uch for he easons  ou stated.  hatever  range  we set or 2, a I  p m t r y W f M though,   think  e would  all  gree hat  he umerical  anges or he ggregates  t his  tage f I w a t t n r f t a a t s o

In  this  ituation,   Chairman,  I hink our b t y s Mr. t y biannual  umphrey-Hawkins testimony  s he rincipal annel hat  his  ommittee uses o H i t p ch t t C t convey  its  onger-term  trategy   the ongress  and  the ublic  enerally.  nd given hat,  hope l s to C p g A t I it  ill ot e  presumptuous f    make just    couple f uick uggestions garding  hat  estimony. w n b i I a o q s re t t

I  thought our  Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony  ast  uly as particularly structive y l J w con because t ncluded    fairly tensive  ection, u will ecall,  at  eviewed  the asis  or he i i a ex s yo r th r b f t Committee's ocus  on  price  tability  our onger-term  arget.  hat  section  lso sserted f s as l t T a a a couple f actical  inciples    guide s  in he  short  un:  one  was that  e want  to  hold he ine  n o t pr to u t r w t l o inflation;  e ther as  that  e would  be  willing  o  take reemptive ction,   ecessary,   get th o w w t p a if n to where  we want  to  go. I hought hen  and  I  do  now that  he iscussion   that  ection  as very t t t d in s w helpful, ry  constructive,   I  would  urge  you  as  a  regular  atter,  t east r he ime  being,  o ve and m a l fo t t t have  a  section  ike  hat  n our estimony  s  a  way of uilding  upport  or ur ong-term  rice l t i y t a b s f o l p stability  jective d  taking  s  a  further ep oward  tying  own longer-term  nflation ob an u st t d i expectations.

With respect  o he pcoming  testimony,    think  his  ould  be  an  excellent casion  o t t u I t w oc t make a  couple f oints.  ne could e  to se  this  estimony  s  an  opportunity   indicate e o p O b u t a to th really  emarkable egree  of onsensus mong central  ankers nd  professional  onomists-r d c a b a ec which  I  thought as especially ident  t he ackson  Hole  conference--that g-term  rice w ev a t J lon p stability  ould e  the rincipal  al  of onetary  policy.  lso,   think t  ould  be  an  excellent sh b p go m A I i w opportunity   note  that  his  ommittee  has een  discussing w to  approach ur  inflation to t C b ho o

In  any  case,    hink  aking these  oints  ould  help ove us  along he oad  over It m p w m t r which  we want  to ravel  n  the ong  run.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let  me respond riefly.  agree  with verything  ou b I e y said,  nd  indeed   will et o hat  n  later marks hat  elate  recisely   this  uestion.  he one a I g t t i re t r p to q T issue  hat   hink  e ought  to egin o  focus n  is he uitability he PI as  a  measure  of t It w b t o t s of  t C anything. he Bureau  of  Economic Analysis ver  at  Commerce  has  long  since ecided hat  t  s T o d t i i a  flawed ndex, nd  in  its  CE deflation ocess  he EA  has  deviated  uite ignificantly m i a P pr t B q s fro the  structure  he  CPI.

MR. BROADDUS. Mr.  Chairman,  I  did ot ean to  put oo  much weight  on  the PI. n m t C I  was  really ying  o  emphasize hat  o he xtent  e can  quantify  ur  inflation  al hat  ould tr t t t t e w o go t w seem  to  be  one  more step n  the irection  ying  own expectations.  here  s   better  umber i d oft d Ift i a n to  use  or  ome combination f umbers to ommunicate our  inflation  al  as  you  expressed  t s o n c go i that  ould  be  fine. w

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. My  impression  s  that  his  ommittee  has n  effect  een i t C i b focusing  n a  lot f ifferent  ice  ndexes,  nd  there  s   growing  consensus ere,  s  you o o d pr i a i a h a suggest,  hat  ringing  nflation  wn over ime  is ealthy  o  the ong-term  rowth  and  viability t b i do t h t l g of he  American  economy. I  agree ith hat onsensus. s I  said,    would  be  a  little  ncerned t w t c A I co about  getting o  explicit   utting  ut  a  number  publicly.   o  not ind  talking  bout t to inp o Id m a i internally.  hink he ore explicit   are  in  our  discussions,  e etter,    that  e all I  t t m we th b so w understand  xactly  here  each  one  of s  is.  m a  little cerned bout oing  public  ven  in e w u Ia con a g e Humphrey-Hawkins testimony.    think  e can  address  he  issue  ou  want  addressed, d  I  agree I w t y an

that  e ought  to, ithout  etting  oo xplicit  th  respect  o  a  number. If  e start ing w w g t e wi t w us a number,  or  any  range f umbers, e will  ring ut  of he  woodwork people ho want  to  get o n w b o t w into hat  I  would  consider  o e  irresponsible ates ith s.  That  would  not  do  us  much w t b d b w u harm,  but t  ould  take way from  the imited  ime  that  e have  to  do  other hings.  So,  as  you i w a l t w t know, I  have  always een  very autious  bout eleasing  number to he  public. b c a r a t

This  addresses  he ssue  hat  erry  ordan as  been  raising   well.  I  do  not isagree t i t J J h as d with  the  concept f   reduction  n  inflation  er ime.

We  would t ofp pr r wi v l t have  great  ifficulty ering o hem,  and  I  think hey ould  make our olicy f oving toward d adh t t t w p o m a  stable  rice  evel  ore difficult ause e would  have  more political blems  to eal  with p l m bec w pro d along  the ay.

That's  ot ecause  I ner p a nu p n b wouldn't  ike  o  see ower  inflation  ppen, ut  I  see  problems.

And if  e went  outside  f his  oom,  the umber of eanings  would  be  multiplied w o t r n m by however  much. We  would  have  the  same problem  with nflation  rgets.   other  ords, hen i ta In w w an  event ccurs,  oes  it  ean the ame thing  o e as  it  oes  to ou?

For  me,  the no T w a p n inflation  mber is ero  whatever he easure, nd  then t atters  hat  affects  s  in oving nu z t m a i m w u m either  oward  or way from  that umber,  whatever he easure.

MR. MCTEER. I  also avor o  change  in  the anges or he easons  hat ou  gave, f n r f t r t y Mr.  Chairman. We certainly   not ant  to  give he 's  too  much external  lay or  to ive  the do w t M p n g impression  hat e are nce  again argeting y  of hem.  On the ther and, ot  only  do  I  think t w o t an t o h n we should  be  watching hem  more internally  an  I  believe  e have  been  lately, lso elieve t th w I  a b that  e should ake occasional  eferences   them  publicly  long ith ther  hings  o  that  hey w m r to a w o t s t do not ie  out n  the ublic  ind.

because  the conomy is rowing  and  because  employment  is  growing  and  unemployment  is oo e g t low. So,  money is  a  very seful  hing  o ave  in ur  tool  it,  nd  we ought  to eep  it  efore he u t t h o k a k b t public--we  ave  to  "use t  r ose t." h i o l i

[Laughter]  It eems  to e that f  our  assertion  rue nd  given  the ay opportunism as s m i y ist a w w explained  o e earlier,  der  conditions ere  we see  inflation    likely   rise,  would  take t m un wh as to we action.    am a  little  nfused. ave we modified he efinition   pportunism? I co H t d ofo

MR. KOHN. No,  we have  not.   think  he uestion  ecomes one  of ow much I t q b h confidence  he  Committee  or he  Committee  member  involved  as  in  this  rojection at t t h p th inflation  ll ick p.  This  is   forecast  nd  there s   range f ncertainty ound  it.  t s rue wi p u a a i a o u ar I i t that  nder  an opportunistic  rategy,  ere  ould  be  an  inclination   ean ery  hard gainst u st th w tol v a tendencies  or nflation    pick p  and  less ard  against  hortfalls.  ,  I o  not  think  e have f i to u h s So d w modified he  definition.    n  opportunistic  mmittee  member became convinced ith  some t Ifa Co w

MR. KOHN. I  think  t  ould  mean that  ou  would  have  sufficient  certainty  out i w y un ab the  forecast d  a  sense hat t  as desirable   wait   while o  get ore information, rticularly an t i w to a t m pa given  some of he  factors  have  talked  bout hat  ill  e  holding own overall  nflation  d t we a t w b d i an probably nflation  pectations is  ear. ou would  have  to  weigh  the  costs nd  benefits i ex th y Y a of waiting o  obtain  ore information,  ven  your  degree f onfidence  n hat  orecast. t m gi o c i t f

MR. PARRY. There  certainly     danger n  doing hat. isa i t

MR. KOHN. The cost f aiting  ould  be  that  n  the vent f ome upcreep n o w w i e o s i inflation  d  inflation  pectations d  given  the ags n olicy, u  would  have  to  induce ore an ex an l i p yo m slack n  the conomy to eep  inflation   he urrent  evel. he  benefit  ould  be  that  f  ou  had i e k att c l T w i y acted ooner n an incorrect recast,  u  would  have  put  some slack  n  the conomy and  caused s o fo yo i e some variations    output hat  ere  unnecessary  o eet  your  objectives   an  opportunistic in t w t m as policymaker.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Don,  you  mentioned  in  your ery  good as v always  presentation  at  here  ay be  some questioning   to  whether e are  still   he th t m as w int preemptive onetary  policy  usiness  r  at east  e are  beginning o  get hose uestions.  y m b o l w t t q M own feeling  rom  looking  t he  behavior  f he arkets nd  being n ew  York and  therefore f a t o t m a i N having  a  nonstop pportunity   talk  o he eople n  the arkets  is hat  uch  questioning  till o to t t p i m t s iss very  tentative,    t  as  in  fact  egun.  The people ho think onetary  policy an  never e  tight if i h b w m c b enough  have  always  been  worried bout s.  Those  who never ind onetary  policy  oose a u f m l enough  would,  of ourse,  e  delighted  f  e got ut  of he reemptive usiness.  ut  I  think  hat c b i w o t p b B t the ast ange  of  more serious  eople n  the  middle  is till  ving s  the enefit  f he oubt.  I v r p i s gi u b o t d am not  sure ow much.

MR. KOHN. I  dont undamentally  isagree  ith our  analysis.    guess   was f d w y I I motivated n  part y  my own concerns,  nd  I  did  not  have  any  good  answers bout ow the i b a a h Committee  would act reemptively, rticularly   situation  ere  we had  a  slow, teady p pa in  a wh s

upcreep  in  inflation  d  some market ommentary that, cause  of he  uncertainties,  would an c be t we need  the o-called  moking  gun in  order o  tighten.  ut  I  agree ith ou  that  t  s ot he s s t B w y i i n t predominant  market  commentary now.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. It ounds  as  if  ou  would  agree hat  here  s s y t t i a wasting sset  uality. a q

MR.  KOHN. Our assessment f he  market's  nterpretation  s, his  ooking-ino t i of u t l the-mirror estion,  as  become more  complicated  ver  the ast  ew years ecause ou  folks qu h o l f b y have  done  such  a  good  job. hen  you  do  not  tighten netary  policy, ople ay he OMC W mo pe s t F must  know something  that  hey o  not now--that  he nderlying  nflation  essures  re ot  as t d k t u i pr a n intense  s  they ight  have  thought  as the ase.

- CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Is  there nything  lse?  Let  me get tarted   beginning a e s by with  the ottom  line  nd  working  backwards.  My  uppermost oncern  is he mergence  of b a c t e gradual,  rip-by-drip  flation  essures.  s Governor  Kelley aid he  other  ay, here  s o d in pr A s t d t i n entry  oint here  we can  say  conclusively at  e should e  tightening,  t  we may find t he p w th w b ye a t end  of he  day  that  he nflation  agon  has  nibbled  s  to eath. t t i dr u d

One of  the easons  hat   raised  he  irrational ectations sue  arlier s in  response r t I t exp is e wa to  Jack uynn's  discussions th  his olleagues  nd  constituents  out  the ense f ranquility G wi c a ab s o t out  there,  hich  history  ells   is o e  looked t ith  a  good deal f repidation.  o  not hink w t us t b a w o t I  d t that  e have  reason o  move today ecause   do  think,   I  will et o  in   minute,  hat  nflation w t b I as g t a t i pressures  re  quite  ontained  t his  oment. But  I  think  e are etting  o  the oint--March  ay a c a t m w g t p m be  the ppropriate me--when e will ave  to ove unless  ery  clear  vidence merges  that  he a ti w h m v e e t expansion s asing ignificantly.  on't  ean evidence hat  DP  growth  is oderating o  1-3/4 i e s I  d m t G m t percent  r  whatever he  forecast .  The GDP  is   nice umber  and  it  oes  have  some o t is a n d relationship    the eal  orld.  I'm ot erribly  rtain  hat  it  s, hough  everyone ells  it to r w n t ce w i t t me does.

The types f hings    would be  looking or re  indications  at  rders  ere  flattening, o t I f a th o w capacity  ressures  learly  ere  easing,  nd  we had  at east  poradic  eports  round his  able  hat p c w a l s r a t t t labor  arket  tightness,  e rucial  ssue  hat  s elated  o verything  e have  been  talking out, m th c i t i r t e w ab was beginning o  show signs f etting . We  have  not een  such  indications  t,  nd  if  e t o l up s ye a w don't,  would  think  hat  n he umphrey-Hawkins report  e would  not  only nderscore  ur I t i t H w u o intention   hold  the ine  n inflation  d  to ake reemptive  ction  s  needed, hich  Al to l o an t p a a w Broaddus  was talking  bout,  ut  we would  have  to rime  the arkets o  anticipate  at  e might a b p m t th w be  moving quite  oon  even  in  the bsence f lear  vidence f pward movements in age or s a o c e o u w

I i c H w b I  d k do  remember that  n  the atter  nths  of  1993 and  especially    January 994,  I  felt  s  though  I i l mo in 1 a was getting  p  on  the able, mping  up  and  down and  screaming,  Hey,  we are bout  to aise u t ju " a r rates."    did t hree  ore times,  nd  I  said,  Hey, ey." [Laughter] e  finally ised  ates  y I i t m a " h W ra r b 25  basis  oints n  February th  and  the arkets sked, hat  did  you  do,  where  did  that  ome p o 4 m a w c from? I  don't  now whether r  not  we can  condition  arkets hat  o  not  wish  to  be  conditioned k o m t d about  changes  in olicy, t  I  do  think  e have  an  obligation   ndicate   advance f ur  move p bu w toi in o o why we are  moving. The old  notion hat  e will xplain  hat  we did  three  eeks  after  he act t w e w w t f in  Humphrey-Hawkins testimony  trikes  as  wholly  inconsistent  th  how long  it  akes he s me wi t t world  to urn. t s ar etter  o  say n  advance  what  we are oing  to o  and  why than  the ther t I i f b t i g d o way around.

Having  looked  at he ata,    must  say  that  he eneral  onsensus round  this  able t d I t g c a t seems  to  reflect  bit  ore  concern bout  an  imminent  acceleration   nflationary ssures  han a m a ofi pre t I  think  he ata re  telling  .  There  is o  doubt  that  he age drift  p. The  question  s ow t d a us n t w isu i h much is t p  relative    what  historical ationships e  indicated  hould ave  been.  I  think i u to rel hav its h we are  all cutely  ware  that he racking  f ither  he CI or  what  I  would  call  djusted  verage a a t t o e t E a a hourly arnings,  hich  attempt  o  adjust  or ndustry  mployment shifts d  overtime,  hows  an e w t f i e an s updrift  ut  not  one  that  quares  ith  our sual age/price  hillips rves,  or xample. Indeed, b s w u w P cu f e if  e assume  that  he CI wage/price  hillips rve  has  been  exactly  n  target,  aning  the w t E P cu o me actual  nd  calculated ge inflation  tes  ave  been  equal,  ut e let  he AIRU a wa ra h b w t N fall  ut s  the o a residual known, solving  or he  NAIRU un f t gives s  a  number well nder  percent. u u 5

Now, I  don't  onsider  hat  n  especially levant ece f nformation cause,  s  I c t a re pi o i be a have  been  saying ver he  last  ear nd  a  half,  think    very pecial  vent nique o  this o t y a I a s e u t particular  siness  ycle s overning hat  we are  observing, mely, he  wage-change/jobbu c i g w na t insecurity  adeoff ctor.  his ssentially  ipulates  at  he ise  n  wages will e  less han tr fa T e st th t r i b t historically  ected ecause f  the  markedly  increased  oncern bout ob ayoffs  nd  that exp b o c a j l a smaller-than-expected  e gains ill onvert o  higher  rofit rgins. hat  in  turn ill ake it wag w c t p ma T w m very  difficult    firm o  raise  ts  rices  ecause rofits e  more  than dequate t ower  prices, fora t i p b p ar a a l thereby rompting  other  ompetitors  o  undercut he igher  rices  nd  increase  arket  share. p c t t h p a m So,  I  hink he rgument  is hat  ob nsecurity  fects ges and  in  turn rices, d  that  s he t t a t j i af wa p an i t process eeping  inflation  wn.

In  short,  can  see  no  credible idence f ncreasing ice  ressures.  nd even I ev o i pr p A though  I  listened   anecdotal  eports  f rice  ressures  round  the able  esterday, u  were  all to r o p p a t y yo talking  bout arts  f our  regional  conomies.  I  would  suspect  hat f  e had  real  ata nd  did  a a p o y e t i w d a full-blown  valuation  f nit  osts,  he aradigm  shift at  athy  Minehan mentioned,  oving e o u c t p th C m from  preventing  ising  upplier ices  o ctually dging  them  down, would  turn ut o  be  far r s pr t a nu o t more prevalent  han   believe  eople  realize. ,  I  think ur olicy  mplementation  as  to  take t I p So o p i h account  of   very omplex  set f onsiderations. hink  e ought o  reflect em  as  best e can a c o c I  t w t th w in  our umphrey-Hawkins report  nd  be  prepared  o  move if  e have  to  at he ext eeting.  I H a t w t n m am not  saying hat  e necessarily  ould.   am just  aying hat  e have  to  be  careful  bout  the t w sh I s t w a inflation  agon's  ibbling  apabilities,  ch  I  mentioned efore,  nd  that  s hat  really dr n c whi b a i w concerns e above  all. f  e make this  n  issue t he umphrey-Hawkins hearing  nd  the m I w a a t H a economy eases nough so  that  o move is ictated, on't  hink  t  ould  do  particularly h e n d I  d t i w muc damage to  monetary  policy. f t  urns  ut  that  e get urprised   a  quick  acceleration I i t o w s by of inflation,  ich  means that  e have  been  somewhat behind  the urve, t east  ur onetary wh w c a l o m policy  hoice ill e  unambiguous.

As a  consequence,    would  argue or taying  t t a n I f s a "B" today ut  with  an  asymmetry  that  s nlike  hat  t he revious  ouple f eetings.

Going  to  the essage  in he umphrey-Hawkins testimony,    think e should it m t H I w h some themes  rather  trongly, d  you  suggested ll  f hem: Another  theme  is hat  ur  goal s s an a o t t o i price  tability  d  that  s ow we achieve ustained onomic  growth.

Especially  ince e would be  moving preemptively  gain,  hich  I elieve  ery  much s w a w b v we should,  e have  to  be  very  careful   the umphrey-Hawkins testimony.    would  hope  that w in H I whatever  the est  f s  are aying etween  now  and  the ext eeting  that  e not  fall  nto he r o u s b n m w i t anti-growth ap. ne particular  ol  hat    think  s ery seful  or s  analytically   one  that tr O to t I i v u f u but feeds he  we-are-against-growth  age, f hich  we are  highly uspected  n ny  case,  s  the se t im o w s i a i u of  the AIRU.

MR. JORDAN. Thank you.  I  am delighted th  last  ear's  esults en  though  they wi y r ev were  not orecast   anybody. [Laughter]  I  hope  for imilar  istakes his  ear n  the ense f f by s m t y i s o more growth, ower  unemployment,  and  less  nflation  an  we are ow projecting.  ut  I  also l i th n B recognize  hat  f  e had  been  more accurate  n  anticipating  e ay 1996 was going  to  come out t i w i th w a  year go, hen  in  spite  f hat  ore favorable  nflation  tlook  e would  not ave  notched a t o t m i ou w h down the  funds ate  arly ast  ear. nd I  would  not ave  supported  educing  he  funds ate  f r e l y A h r t r i we had  been  able o nticipate  re accurately e  way the  year ame out.  Given  that, gic  ells t a mo th c lo t me that  e would  have  been  better f  ith  hindsight t  to  have  recalibrated,    we probably w of w no and would  be  happier  oday  if  he unds ate  ere  at -1/2 ercent.  ertainly,   t  ere  at -1/2 t t f r w 5 p C if i w 5 percent,  e would  not e  reducing t. w b i

I  am very oncerned,  r.

MR. BOEHNE.

We  ought  never t t g u d m get  ourselves  n  the osition  aying hat  e are  tightening  cause  there  s oo uch growth  or i p ofs t w be i t m the nemployment rate s oo  low. Whenever we tighten,  ught o  be  explained  n  a u i t ito t i framework  of ro-sustainable wth  and  pro-job rowth.  This  NAIRU p gro g concept,  hile t  eans w i m a  lot  o conomists,  s   very nfortunate y of ommunicating  because  99.99  percent  f he t e i a u wa c o t people ust  o  not  understand  t  nd  it  omes  across  s  meaning  that  e are gainst  rowth  and j d i a c a w a g against  ore  jobs. hile  we as  economists nderstand  he AIRU m W u t N concept nd  its  sefulness, a u we really  ave  to ecast  ur  whole  approach n  terms f ommunicating  that  e are ro-growth, h r o i o c w p and  it  an  be  done.  Our  case s uch more salable  f  e put rice tability hat  ontext. c i m i w p s int c I would  urge  you  in our  Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony, d  I  would  urge  all f s  in  the y an o u aftermath  f hat,   move strongly  n hat  irection    our ublic  omments because  I  think t  s o t to i t d in p c i i the  most  effective  y that  e can  educate  he ublic nd  further  heir derstanding  f he wa w t p a t un o t value f  price  tability. o s

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  tem. S

MR.  STERN. I  agree ith  your  recommendation.  Let e just  ake   moment  to w m t a elaborate.  n  my view,  circumstances  ave  not  changed  significantly  ecent  onths,  so  I I h in  r m continue  o  think  here  s   reasonably  igh robability  at  e are oing  to  want  to  adopt   more t t i a h p th w g a restrictive icy  ver  the ourse f  1997. But  if    ask  myself hy now,  I  think  e do  not ave  a pol o c o I w w h reason hat  e can  use  that  ill arner ny  amount of upport  or cting  t his  uncture.    then t w w g a s f a a t j I ask  myself he  further  uestion:  hat are  the onsequences f  our  soon-to-become-famous t q W c i y inflation  agon  does  start  ibble    little  oner han e expect nd  we find urselves  ehind dr on a so t w a o b the  curve?  It eems  to e the mplications  hat  re hat  ither  would have  to  move a  little s m i oft a t e we further  t he  end  of he ay  than e otherwise  ould  or  maybe we would  move by  the  same a t t d w w amount  but n  a  more concentrated riod f ime  than therwise.  hose  costs  o  not eem to e i pe o t o T d s m to  be  very  great.  So,  I  am comfortable  ith our  recommendation. w y

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  elzer. M

MR. MELZER. Thanks,  Alan.  I  favor lternative  or t east  omething n  that a C a l s i direction,  d  my reasons emain  the  same  as  I  have  been  stating:   hink nflation   oo  high, an r It i ist and  I  see ncreasing idence hat  nflationary  essures e  building, pecially   labor  arkets. i ev t i pr ar es in m Finally, o  not hink ne  can  say  that  he tance f olicy  s t ll  estrictive ht  ow; so  I I  d t o t s o p i a a r rig n believe  ome action  s alled  or. e  clearly e  not oing  to  do  anything t his  eeting,  ut  as s i c f W ar g a t m b we anticipate ossible  ove in  the uture,  might  want  to  think  bout  one  that  nce  taken a  p m f we a o would leave eople n  a  position ere  they re  uncertain out  what  the irection  he ext p i wh a ab d oft n move would be.  In  other ords,  we are  in  a  much different  sition an e were  last  ime  when w po th w t we were  in hese ircumstances, arting     3 percent  unds  rate ith  a  long ay to  go.  We t c st ata f w w probably re  not  too  far way from  where  we ought o  be,  and  we should hink  bout oing a a t t a d enough  in ne shot o  that  here s ncertainty out  the  direction  he  next ove. That  might o s t i u ab oft m argue  against    modest  move as  an  opening  salvo,  ne  that  imply ould  encourage eople o a o s w p t speculate  n  the ext ove. Once we got  enough  tightening ne  the  last  ime, e had  a  very o n m do t w beneficial pact  on  long-term  arkets. n  fact,  e raised  he  funds ate  y, s  I ecall,    basis im m I w t r b a r 50 points  t ne  point nd  actually t   drop  in  long  rates.  t  ould be  nice o e  able o et here a o a go a I w t b t g t sooner ather  han  later en and  if  e do  move. r t wh w

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Phillips.

MS. PHILLIPS. Thank you. I  support  B" asymmetric.  It eems  to  me that  he " s t situation   airly  imilar  here  we were  last  ummer.
