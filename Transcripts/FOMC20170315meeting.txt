titled 'The Macroeconomic Effects of StateEnding of Reinvestment' that I prepared with my colleagues Hess Chung, review several approaches for ending reinvestment. MR. LÓPEZ-SALIDO. 4   Thank you, Madam Chair.  I will briefly discuss some of the results presented in the memo Contingent Cynthia Doniger, Cristina Fuentes-Albero, and Bernd Schlusche.  Then Jane Ihrig and Julie Remache will to ending exhibit 1 outlines these approaches and our modeling the final quarter of the year in which the federal funds rate first or 2½ percent; reinvestment then stops completely and of which reinvestments cease in full at the end of the third Our memo focuses on macroeconomic implications of two approaches reinvestment.  The top panel of assumptions.  Specifically, we consider a state-contingent policy under which reinvestment ends in passes either 1½ percent permanently.  We compare economic outcomes of adopting such a policy to those a fixed-date policy under quarter of 2017, as assumed in Tealbook B, regardless of macroeconomic conditions at that time.

In this memo, we analysis by using stochastic simulations to construct probability for future economic conditions and for the size of the balance sheet and interest rates, matches the January Tealbook projection.  The FRB/US model simulations are in Tealbook interest rate rule that incorporates an intercept-adjusted Taylor (1999) rule. projection and under an alternative, adverse broaden the distributions under alternative reinvestment policies.  We conduct the stochastic simulations using the FRB/US model, with a baseline for real activity, inflation, which combined with the model used for balance sheet and income projections B, in which the term premium effects are endogenous.  In the simulations, the federal funds rate is governed by an inertial version of the of the exhibit summarizes the main results.  Inasmuch as the 1½ percent implying a nearly 50 percent probability that reinvestment continues the policy with a 1½ percent rule.  When we instead reinvestment ends in the final quarter of the year in which the federal appreciably lower than under the 1½ percent policy, with the median date delayed until 2018.  Accordingly, across the entire set of is the fixed-date policy.  Under the 2½ percent median balance sheet size is about $660 billion larger than under the The middle panel federal funds rate in the January Tealbook baseline averages just under 1½ percent in 2017:Q4, about half of the simulations show the federal funds rate below at that time, beyond the end of this year under assume that funds rate passes 2½ percent, the probability of having ended reinvestment by 2018 and 2019 is of ceasing reinvestment simulations, under the 1½ percent policy, the median size of the balance sheet about $525 billion larger than under policy, the fixed-date policy.

However, because the federal funds rate inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the stimulus provided by a larger balance is partially offset by the endogenous reaction of the federal funds rate.

to which balance sheet normalization should incorporate state-contingent in evaluating various options; and the increasing demands by market and others for additional information regarding the details of the sheet normalization. I'll touch briefly on four themes that have emerged in recent staff discussions:  the extent features; the potential for linkages across policy tools; the balance of benefits, costs, and risks participants Committee's plans for balance presented in the staff memos for this meeting made them natural in the Committee's discussion today.  That said, policymakers that incorporate additional statesheet normalization.  For example, the discussion in the memos focuses on policies in which the Committee funds rate as a trigger, possibly with the period of balance sheet In these options, ruling out the possibility of restarting reinvestments in waiting to instead wish to indicate that reinvestments in some adverse scenarios.  All else being equal, that should tend to the option value of waiting to cease reinvestments.  Policymakers may also is more of a for the cessation of reinvestments rather than a trigger.  That might be the it could be appropriate to begin for the federal funds rate or if they wished to reserve the option to delay on the basis of an assessment of the economic elements in memos for research directors, an adverse economic in that event could wish to buffer the market effects of those in whole or in part for a time. On the issue of state-contingent policy, we thought the simplicity and clarity of the options candidates to consider may wish to consider variations on these approaches contingent features in the approach to balance much of establishes a predetermined level of the federal delay, for the permanent cessation of reinvestments during normalization. in response to some future adverse shocks induces some 'option value' cease reinvestments.  Policymakers might could be restarted reduce wish to consider approaches in which the level of the federal funds rate 'threshold' case, for example, if policymakers judged that balance sheet normalization at a meeting that does not involve an increase in the target range the implementation of redemptions outlook.  In principle, the FOMC could even incorporate state-contingent managing the runoff of the balance sheet over time.  For example, the pace of redemptions could be varied over time in response to the evolution of the economic outlook.  Indeed, as noted in the shock could lead to more rapid paydowns of the Federal Reserve's MBS holdings, and policymakers prepayments by reinitiating MBS reinvestments

incorporating more state-contingent In principle, policies that embed state-contingent features may foster better if the policies are difficult to explain and result in greater about future Federal Reserve actions.  Furthermore, incorporating a of state-contingent features in the policy on reinvestments could greatly dimensionality of the FOMC's policy decisions and blur the line between as the 'active' tool of policy and the as a more passive tool. As usual, there are some costs and benefits to features. macroeconomic outcomes.  On the other hand, these potential benefits may be small and could be undercut uncertainty complex set increase the the target range for the federal funds rate balance sheet emerged in recent staff discussions is the extent to which may create Another theme that has the Committee's announced approach to balance sheet normalization perceived linkages across policy tools.  For example, policies that link the cessation

For shock, market participants could funds rate.  That policy action, in turn, could imply changes that would put downward pressure on term premiums and reinforce pressures on longer-term rates differing views regarding the desirability of such linkages an adverse shock, some might regard the juxtaposition of cuts in the the Federal Reserve's balance sheet as On the other hand, if the term small, the potential gains from such as small relative to the challenges of communicating how the for unintended changes in prepayment in the MBS market.  And attempting to design linkages between interest rate policy may run counter to a desire to keep the process of sheet normalization in the background and largely on autopilot. Policymakers may have across policy tools.  On the one hand, linkages of this type could be viewed as valuable in helping to stabilize the economy in response to various shocks.  Indeed, in the event of target federal funds rate and sizable runoffs in counterproductive policy that is difficult to rationalize. premium effects of changes in reinvestments are linkages may be viewed tools would be coordinated and the potential risks policy and reinvestment balance

It's pretty fast in the easing, so this sort of asymmetry is not built model right now, and you're totally right.  If instead of using an inertial Taylor-type rule, inertia component, within the context of the FRB/US model, there probably been a substantial increase in the likelihood of hitting the effective lower bound.

So just let it roll off, and if the Treasury decides to issue bills rather than at longer maturities, is there an question, which is Treasury debt management we discussed with management? has the Treasury been brought into this discussion?

That would probably be similar to the effect the issuance in the future-our understanding in conversations they would eventually look to increase issuance at longer-term maturity on market rates and you'd see that the term longer-term Treasury securities could increase. MS. REMACHE.  To the first part of your question, President Rosengren, you're right. Of course, the market effect will depend on the Treasury's issuance decisions, and to the extent that they expect if we were buying Treasury bills and maintaining the larger size of the portfolio.  Of course, depending on how they manage with them is that points-then that would affect the overall effect premium in that there was a Board briefing in May of last year by in which she looked at how the Treasury would respond to the Federal Reserve's MS. IHRIG.  I just wanted to note Erin Ferris redemption policy, and depending if they issued, say, bills only or only long-term bonds, our model suggests there could be an effect.

worried about the than us doing it, they would have the option of doing it over time.  Is MR. ROSENGREN.  Just a quick follow-up.  But they have the option, of course, to start with all Treasury bills and then, over time, go long.  So, in effect, if we're effect on markets, rather that right?

The one issue that's that it's very hard for them to adjust their auction schedule over a short period of to have a period of time to do that, just as we would want the private to have some time to understand that they would be holding more long-term securities in the mortgage market and also the Treasury MR.

MR. LACKER.  Yes, I know, but what difference does it make what day we do it on? You're saying the size has to change, right?

The Treasury traditionally follows a regular and predictable approach to MS. LOGAN. their fund issuance.

MR. LACKER.  Right, right.

You said something about them increasing the same amount, but always to the amount that they will over time.  Even midquarter if they need to increase the total amount by any larger amount, and it will take them a MS. LOGAN.  Right.  Their communication is auction to the public, and they like to keep that amount only moving marginally during the crisis when they had to do that, they did that slowly.  They may also add a reopening longer period of time.  So they may add a reopening of that security.

March 14-15, 2017

DUDLEY.  Okay.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Uncreatively, I'm few other are relevant. VICE CHAIRMAN going to start with the three questions posed by the staff, and then I'll delve into a issues that I think timing of a change in ending or phasing out reinvestments should be tied to the cost of the risk of returning to the effective lower bound for short-term interest rates over the benefits of having a smaller balance sheet and more room for expansion should one end up at the lower bound sometime in the future over the a tradeoff there.  If we delay, we don't have as much balance in the future, relevant here. The first part of the first question was factors influencing the reinvestments.  I think the timing of relative the medium term versus balance sheet longer term.  So I think there's sheet capacity in the future.  If we go sooner, we have more balance sheet capacity and I think that's

that affect the risk of returning to the lower bound-that's my criteria for thinking about this-I would first ask the question, what's the likelihood the In other words, to three-year time horizon?  And, is available in terms of short-term interest rate reductions and balance effective lower bound for interest rates?  What that to me is that there's no magic single federal funds rate that tells you when to stop.  If you downside risk, that would argue for level compared with a weaker you had a sheet and freeing up that some future bad event. In terms of the factors primary economy will maintain its forward growth momentum over the next few years? what's the probability of an economic downturn over a twosecond, how much room sheet expansion to avoid getting pinned at the means have a stronger, more robust expansion path, or one with less phasing out reinvestments at a somewhat lower federal funds rate economy, or one with more downside risks.  The reason why you'd go sooner if stronger economy is that you would value drawing down the balance capacity for

March 14-15, 2017

2 percent.  Under the outlook that we have today and the next year or couple of years, I'm currently inclined to phase while we're in the bottom half of that range, but, of course, that could to the point of year, depending on the outlook. I had been assuming that we would begin to end reinvestments when the federal funds rate was somewhere between 1 and prospect for fiscal stimulus over the out reinvestments obviously change as the outlook changes.  So that would imply that we could get wanting to start to end the reinvestments before the end of the as to the precise starting point, and that really has not been my make sure that we're ready to move as early as we to move.  I wouldn't want to have to delay the start of balance sheet normalization we, at the Committee level, hadn't worked out all the details about how this is Now, I'm open-minded greatest concern.  My greatest concern is to would like just because supposed to work.

second half of the first question is, what principles should guide possible restarting a tightening of monetary policy.  So that suggests to me that we shouldn't be running actually lowering our funds rate target range. The of reinvestment sometime in the future?  My starting point is that a runoff of the portfolio represents down the portfolio-in other words, tightening-if at the same time we're federal to me like a very simple reaction function would be whenever you cut interest runoff.  And I don't think that's a particularly difficult thing to In fact, we reached a similar conclusion a few years ago when, remember, we were having the agency MBS runoff and we sort of asked ourselves the pinned at the effective lower bound for interest in policy that we would actually reinvest the agency runoff. seems very It seems rates, you also cease communicate to the markets. you'll question, why are we doing this, given that we're rates?  And then we made a change So I think that you can have a more complex reaction function than this, but this one

Being clear on this point, though, would have the benefit risk of returning to the effective lower bound, because investors and runoff will end whenever short-term interest rates fall.  That economy by compressing the term premium. raised in their presentation. intellectually consistent, coherent, and easy to explain-when we cut short-term rates, we just simply cease letting back to a normalized balance sheet. stabilize the balance sheet of slightly reducing the market participants know that the should provide a bit of additional support to the That's something that the staff

Well, I feel pretty two-year tapering of Treasury securities and agency securities three approaches.  In my mind, it reduces the risk of a taper tantrum, because with the expectations of most market to last about a year.  This would take But the cost of doing it over two years seems to be relatively small in delay in getting back to a normalized balance sheet.  By the staff's simulations, just a three-quarter lag relative to the full phaseout of reinvestments immediately.  Also, of tapering, I think, helps you cope with the two years when the Treasury maturities are the highest-2018 and 2019.  And a more stretched-out process also gives time to adjust its debt management strategy-something we have just been to minimize disruption to the U.S. Treasury securities market. end to reinvestments gains us much time in terms of getting back to a sheet.  But it does, to me, add some nonmaterial risk of disrupting the security and agency MBS markets. The second question was views regarding the four illustrative options. strongly that the option of the dominates the other the ending of reinvestments occurs slowly compared participants, which is for the phaseout of reinvestments twice as long as that. terms of the there's having two years security the Treasury more talking about-and auction cycles I don't think that an abrupt normalized balance Treasury

But it seems to not as simple to communicate, and at least I have trouble figuring out what level of the number rather than another.  Why was more of an arbitrary nature to it. I'm sympathetic Treasury flow of additional Treasury debt supply that the me it's floor you would pick and why you would pick a particular the floor set at $30 billion of Treasury securities, as opposed to $25 billion of those securities or at some other level?  It seems to have a bit to agency MBS, which was the last choice, would significantly raise sheet, and I don't think that is very attractive.  The share of the MBS in our portfolio will be somewhat higher if we run off Treasury does not seem to be very material.  I don't put a lot of Confining the runoff the period of time to normalize the balance fact that the securities and agency MBS together weight on that.

It could be by the in her press conference statement.  And I think it might even be useful to paper that provides a lot of detail in terms of how this is all likely to longer term.  I think the more clarity we can give to people-material to have less risk of a sharp market reaction I don't think the communication should be done piecemeal, bit by bit, The third question was about what changes in communication may be appropriate concerning reinvestment mainly through the minutes until we have agreement on a implementation.  I wouldn't want to say too much until we work out all of the details. once we have the plan all worked out, I think it would be appropriate for a broader set communications.  It Chair in a speech or consider having a white work out over the digest-will make this likely to be more successful and that we don't anticipate.

March 14-15, 2017

I really do think this fits in in terms of our longer-term balance sheet strategy.  And I better to get that all out together in one big piece. because think it's part of this design of balance sheet normalization, we also should try to seek to achieve in the longer system in which we operate on the flat part of the for reserves?  And, if so, how much excess reserves, roughly, will this require?  I floor versus corridor system that we had a few meetings ago there a floor, and my view is, let's nail that down and decide what the longer term. There are a few other issues that I think also need to be addressed.  First and foremost, I do think, as agreement about the broad parameters of the balance sheet that we seek run.  In particular, are we going to run a floor demand curve felt in our discussion about the was a pretty strong consensus for balance sheet we are actually heading to over

were to go to a floor system, this would imply a excess reserves probably in the $500 billion to $1 trillion range.  And if you read the closely, it seems like it's probably at the higher end of that range than the lower end to be more precise than to just give a margin of how much think this would have an advantage because if with, 'this is where we're heading, and this is how much excess reserves likely to have in the system,' the market could also sort of figure out the balance sheet size big market reaction to this decision, because if you ended up with a balance sheet system much lower excess reserves. The staff memo suggested that if we range of staff memo of the range, but I don't think we have excess reserves we'd like to see in the system.  I we provided the market we're that we're likely actually headed to three or four years out.  And I think that would also reduce the risk of a that included $500 billion or $1 trillion of excess reserves, the balance sheet shrinkage over the next few years really would be much smaller than if you were heading back to a corridor with

March 14-15, 2017

tightening of monetary policy.  I think we should be clear that at any point in time balance sheet decision should be viewed as a substitute for a further hike in our target.  In other words, I think we want to communicate this so that market unlikely that a decision on reinvestment will be coupled at the same rate hike.  I anticipate that when we announce the phaseout of reinvestment, we take a pause in terms of interest rate hikes. Second, I think we need to be clear that we think that a phasing out of reinvestment does represent a this type of federal funds rate participants infer that it's time with a probably would also in more concrete terms, you can imagine rate hikes at this meeting, in June, reinvestment, but no rate hike announced in December, or the point is that I think it's relatively unlikely and announce the substitutes in terms of To put it September, then with the tapering of you could have some different combination.  But that you would be in an economy in which you would want to both raise rates end of reinvestment at the same FOMC meeting, because I think they're monetary policy tightening.

important to recognize more explicitly that just as there are risks from balance sheet-the risk that we might not subsequently have sufficient room to federal funds rate and avoid an early return to the effective lower bound-there are also more.  The most notable one is that the sooner we start, the sooner we response to the future to the lower bound.  More importantly, I think having a large sheet capacity should also help us by reducing the risk of inflation Third, I think it's normalizing the cut the some risks from delaying this process.  I think that's sort of in the memos, but I think we could draw that out a little generate more balance sheet capacity that we could potentially use in periods when we're at or close amount of balance expectations becoming unanchored to the downside because people would know that there was this other tool that could be used with some force.

March 14-15, 2017

the fact is that the Committee recognizes that the bigger the balance sheet and the the greater the risk in the future that a need to U.S. Treasury and force us to create sheet a little bit sooner rather than a little bit later. I think longer the duration of the assets in our portfolio, push up short-term interest rates could significantly cause our net interest margin to narrow or even turn negative.  That could cut off our remittances to the a deferred asset on our balance sheet.  I think we all put some risk on that, and we can avoid that risk by normalizing the balance very pleased that the Committee is taking this work forward, and I thank the staff for time, it's good that we've this all nailed down over the next few meetings so that we're ready when the time comes.  Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm their work on the memos.  Even if this process doesn't start for a long started, and I'm hoping that we get completely

Thank you, Madam Chair.  This is an opportune reducing the conditions will be suitable for us to begin that process by the end of this the conditions and responding to the general comments.

effects on term premiums on longeris notable that studies in the academic literature-notably, almost the entire that The staff analysis takes the prevailing view within the Federal Reserve-that is, that LSAPs and the MEP have had large and highly persistent term interest rates through stock effects.  Although I personally view this as a reasonable baseline case, it academic finance community-question this conclusion.  Some of these analyses suggest our large balance sheet could be playing a relatively minor role in depressing term premiums

highly persistent stock effects on term premiums vary the effects assumed in the memos are at the upper end of this range. today.  More generally, estimates of widely, and these outside analyses in the staff memos staff and policymakers, and question the conventional wisdom and to encourage divergent views.  So I just struck by the difference between the views that we all talk within the Federal Reserve and what I hear when I leave the Federal Reserve and talk Reserve on this particular issue.  I'm not trying to draw more that we should make sure that we challenge our own views. I would encourage additional consideration of and potentially in a Tealbook alternative view box.  I mention that specifically because I have viewed these boxes to be a great innovation, both for the Federal Reserve to challenge thought I would mention that.  I'm about here to other researchers outside the Federal any specific conclusions-it's

I think that we got it right the first time.  The language from our Plans document remains appropriate.  It says that 'the intends that the Federal Reserve will, in the longer run, hold no more securities than leaves the next few years-it doesn't really affect, in the next few years-I do think, as Vice there are advantages if we could clarify sooner rather than should be, that there to doing that soon. Regarding strategy, Policy Normalization Principles and Committee necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.'  Of course, that unanswered how large the quantity of reserves should be in the long run.  And although the staff analysis shows that whether the answer is $100 billion or $500 billion doesn't really materially affect the path of the balance sheet normalization for if you look at the Tealbook B, the term premium Chairman Dudley mentioned, that later our views on what we think the ultimate size of the balance sheet would be some benefits of the implementation of normalization, I continue to prefer to management overall in the background and keep the focus on policy actions In terms of the specifics keep balance sheet

March 14-15, 2017

also There's just too much uncertainty about sheet policy to use them actively as a regular tool of policy in next action regarding the balance sheet.  Although there is some upside to keeping a larger balance the Board staff does will show that, I just want to note, as I to keep both and communications squarely on the funds rate.  I think that has served us well.  It's consistent with our earlier statement on normalization. the effects of LSAPs and balance normal times.  We don't want market participants constantly trying to guess what our will be sheet for longer, and every analysis have in the past, that there are also presumably costs of doing so, and it's important in mind.

to rely on qualitative criteria to signal the regard, it's prudent to recall that date-based forward or setting specific macro thresholds have not always served us well.  I would prefer to to specific levels of the funds rate. So now to the specific questions.  I prefer conditions for ending reinvestment.  In this guidance avoid date-based guidance or economic triggers or references Instead, keep communications qualitative, at least for now.

way.  As we've said before, we need economic outlook with balanced risks, and we need confidence that the process of all of these factors have to come us to judge that it's time to start the process of ending reinvestments.  Now, my own will be well-aligned when the federal And like Vice Chairman Dudley, I think a number of factors come together on this decision.  The normalization process needs to be well under a solid normalization of short-term rates will continue.  So I think together for view, used in my economic projection, is that these factors funds rate target is around 1½ percent.  Again, like I said, I expect that to be toward the end of this year.

rate that's mentioned in one of the memos.  My the nominal funds rate is 2¾ percent.  I don't think it's I do worry a bit about this 2½ percent own view is that r * with regard to

March 14-15, 2017

a 2½ percent trigger, basically allowing a pretty high probability, in my view, that we will not start time or perhaps not at all.  So I would think carefully about having such as a trigger. implausible that it's actually 2½ percent.  And so I think if we were to set we're normalization for a long a high funds rate reduction in the balance sheet, my view to be on autopilot.  On that score, the most straightforward process and the one easiest to maturing securities and principal would also lean in the direction of a shorter we never use the word 'taper' again you can't have a 'phaseout My view is that shorter rather than longer would be best. In considering options on how to implement the is that the key is not to have the process look to be actively managed.  As much as possible, we want it communicate is to have the runoff be based on the pace of repayments.  I would basically keep it simple.  I rather than a longer phaseout.  I do recommend strongly that in this building, so 'phaseout' is preferred to 'taper' because tantrum.'

reducing the balance to what's happening in the economy.  Again, I'm just reiterating what the Vice Chairman explicit that the reinvestments or other changes in our balance sheet in response to adverse shocks that require a cut in the funds rate.  I think that a lot of positives to it, and I think that's consistent with our long-term strategy. Our communications should relay the expectation that the process of sheet will proceed predictably over time.  Of course, I agree that the process of rebalancing would, as with any monetary policy decision we make, be subject economy and our outlook for the just said-we should be could be restarted actually has using the minutes and, obviously, the Chair's press conferences.  Ultimately, we statement of what we're doing, and we can do that more formally in the Now, in terms of how to best communicate this, I think, at least for now, we really are going to be have to come to a clear FOMC statement.  Thank you.

Overall, I think balance sheet expansion was an MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I'm in favor of taking steps to reduce the size of could follow up this discussion by changing some of the statement sheet emergency tool that should now be put away.

into six main comments.  I'll just run through them.  A lot are going to echo what President Williams and Vice Chairman Dudley just said.  First, analysis, the effects of ending reinvestment seem to be relatively small.  To of a policy that pushes ahead and tries to normalize the balance sheet as I've organized my comments of these according to the staff me, that argues in favor part of our broader normalization program.

moving sooner rather than later.  I found the 'Immediate be a lot of difference between the also like to reduce the probability of a negative to the Treasury to a low level, which I think would be problematic for the Federal and for the Committee. Second, I would prefer Cessation' option the most persuasive.  There didn't seem to first three options that were put forward.  I would remittance Reserve comment is that current monetary policy is arguably twisting the yield curve as where it would otherwise be.  Our big balance sheet policy is actually the effects that would otherwise be occurring due to the policy rate on the My third we normalize relative to undoing some of normalization process.  According to our rhetoric, we are putting downward pressure medium and longer end of the yield curve even as we are raising the policy rate.  I think this is confusing.  It sends conflicting signals as to whether we think the economy is actually improving

March 14-15, 2017

a more enough to withstand a normalization process.  Ending reinvestment would allow for natural yield curve normalization process than the one we have entrained right now.

The Committee's idea seems to be that rate is good because in part it allows the Committee to react to a negative in the future.  But the same can be said for the balance sheet. the balance sheet today, the Committee would maintain optionality to in the future should a severe enough negative shock the balance sheet during the relatively good times that we are enjoying My fourth comment is on the policy space issue. raising the policy shock by lowering the policy rate By lowering the size of again increase the size of the balance sheet occur.  I'm agreeing with Vice Chairman Dudley on that dimension.  In short, we should be reducing the size of today.

the table may worry about like the taper tantrum during the summer of 2013.  In my view, the taper tantrum was a FOMC the June 2013 meeting.  I will remind all of you that we actually did nothing at meeting.  We did not change policy at all, but it was the communication regarding possible changes that led to the taper tantrum.  The actual taper decision was not made until taper all through 2014, and we saw very little turmoil in response to that.  So I think, properly communicated, a balance sheet My fifth comment is on taper tantrum issues.  Some around events communications issue.  Markets turned out to be surprised by an unexpectedly 'hawkish' announcement at that future December 2013, and when that decision was made, we saw very little reaction in financial markets.  Indeed, we carried through with the financial normalization program would work out just fine.

that I do not like tying the date of reinvestment cessation to a level percent.  That was called 'state-contingent policy' in the embed the assumption that the current policy rate is below the neutral My sixth comment is of the policy rate, such as 1½ or 2½ memo.  Those simulations

March 14-15, 2017

therefore, must be raised in order to maintain inflation at target and a low level.  I think the Committee should recognize that we may be in a low regime, in which case the policy rate would not naturally return to its longer-run even to any value approaching that mean.  In short, the neutral policy rate may be much is assumed in these simulations. level today and, unemployment at real interest rate mean or lower than true, we should make an independent decision on balance sheet is based on the assumption of an unrealistic degree of mean reversion state contingency outcomes-inflation near target and unemployment at its longer-run the policy rate because of this neutral rate issue and where the might be.  We are meeting our criteria today in terms of inflation being near target increases in the future anyway, as we now project out.  The the balance sheet from that perspective.  So you should get on with right.  Thank you, Madam Chair. To the extent that this is normalization, not one that in global safe real interest rates.  That argument is, in my mind, a version of the one put forward by Vice Chairman Dudley and President Williams just now.  In short, the should be based on goal level-not tied to the level of neutral rate and unemployment being near its longer-run level, so we should prepare to go ahead with balance sheet normalization.  From the perspective of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, we're not seeing a lot of policy rate only thing left to normalize is it.  All

reinvestment policy.  For me, job of laying out the issues we need to consider.  I believe the Committee's and Plans was still a good starting point.  Our goals reduce the size of the balance sheet and return it to primarily Treasury securities.  The options discussed in the memos provide alternative approaches to ultimately accomplishing think it's premature for us to have this discussion even though we level of excess reserves than we currently hold.  And taking the time it's going to take to reduce the balance sheet absent any sales, we can I want to start by thanking the staff for the set of memos on they did an excellent statement on Policy Normalization Principles remain to four these goals, and I don't haven't decided yet on the long-run framework.  Even in a floor system, that would entail a smaller balance sheet with a lower into account initiate an end to reinvestments without precluding either framework.

commence phasing out reinvestments after rate.  This does seem like a good time to begin planning for The Committee has stepped back from date-dependent guidance used We've already indicated that we'll cease or we have begun increasing the funds how we'll go about it.  I prefer state-contingent timing for ending reinvestments rather than a date-dependent change. during the recession, and I see no reason to go back.

that's independent of the state of the economy.  In my view, for ending reinvestments would be the same ones we used to determine rate.  After all, we're setting the funds rate on the basis of the funds rate even if we don't communicate it that way in terms of our own and decisionmaking.  It seems to me that would be consistent with the language As we've seen, the economy can evolve differently than expected, and I see little gain in setting a date to end reinvestments the economic conditions the appropriate target for the funds trying to get to our dual-mandate goals.  I think we could tie the change in reinvestment policy to the level of discussions

I believe that with proper able to handle a change in our Under my economic outlook, I'd be later at a funds rate 2½ percent rate considered in one of communication, the economy and financial markets will be reinvestment policy later this year, which would be consistent with my outlook.

policies as a tool for extraordinary the economic outlook materially deteriorates, rate further below its long-run level and the probability of effective lower bound rises significantly.  Then we may want to restart is, we could consider using our balance sheet tool, but only when the a non-normal policy environment. Once we end or phase in an end to reinvestments, I think the bar should be fairly high for reversing and restarting reinvestments.  I view balance sheet times and not as a regular tool of monetary policy, so any restart of reinvestments should be tied to the economy entering into an unusual state.  If we would begin reducing the funds nearing the reinvestments.  That economy reenters

Chairman Dudley's, but recall that many of the Tealbook, have us raising the funds rate above the long-run level and state.  I wouldn't consider overshooting the long-run level and bringing This is a stricter criterion than Vice forecasts, including the then bringing it back down.  To my mind, we need to have some further criteria that we're entering into an unusual it back down to be enough.

I know of the academic community, but it's kind of hard for me to when you increase the supply of something, the price doesn't go down. Our discussion obviously takes stock counterpart of past flows of QE and has the there's skepticism about this in parts believe that and possibly others among us were quite function for the Federal as we could use our balance sheet and structure it so that it sort of was balanced like an with different securities suitable for such an intervention.  It was very interesting, but think any of us should consider going down that road.  We use monetary policy, which is to Jeremy point. Now, when we first started discussing this, I taken with the notion that it was really a major, so to speak, insurance Reserve, insurance company should balance its balance sheet and to be ready to intervene here, there, and everywhere I don't powerful because it covers the whole economy.

Monetary policy is a macroeconomic instrument, and I don't think we should try to go further than crisis.  So what should we do about reinvestments?  I think we're getting close which we need to start part it's because of all this nagging necessary.  I think we can figure out 2½ percent interest rate scenario-we will also be just go to changes in minutes, et cetera.

comment I'll make is, there's been discussion of needing to raise rates in this so we have room to cut them.  I always struggle when I hear that so we can floor it if the hill comes.'  It's better to just gas in advance so you can floor it when the hill comes. The last advance of doing any of argument.  To me it's like driving down the highway and saying, 'Well, we may have a hill approach, so let's let off the gas now maintain your speed than let off the sheet announcement triggers an adverse market response?  I doubt it.  I think it's much likely we're just going to hold our policy and maybe defer our federal funds rate hike.  If right that in response to an adverse market reaction we're just going to hold, I would rather lower federal funds rate than hold at a higher federal funds rate while that tantrum And I think about the notion of, if we raised rates, are we really going to cut them if this balance more I'm hold at a subsides.

I start with the premise that the Chair actually articulated in the beginning, that interest rate policy for affecting broader incomparably more experience in using policy rate changes does in using the balance sheet.

implication of that preference is that, in the absence of other considerations, to shrink until the federal funds rate is at least approaching a level that would allow the to react to a downturn aggressively and effectively through interest rate reductions.  I the 'hawkish-dovish' spectrum, but rather as being prudently in the spirit of hoping for the best and preparing for the worst. To me, the which I'll return to in a second, the Committee would ideally not begin to allow the balance sheet Committee don't see this view as located on bearish

I don't have an exact figure, but I'll just point out that over rate reduction associated with a recession has been such reduction has been more than 4 percent. So the question is:  How high should the federal funds rate be moves away from the past 50 years, the average total policy over 5 percent, and the smallest rates three times this year, the federal funds rate will be at a full point lower than it used to be, is also consistent with to a specific date or to a threshold.  I would rather keep it qualitative for If the Committee raises 138 basis points.  And even with a neutral rate that could be a rate of 138 basis points is not high enough, in my view, to actually begin to reduce reinvestments.  On the current path, the middle of 2018 seems to be about the right time to seriously consider moving away from full reinvestment, and that timing market expectations, diverse though they may be.  And I would echo others that I personally am not particularly attracted the time being.

There are plausible reasons why the Committee that balance sheet. hard for rather than you forgoing in order to move the sheet forward in time?  It's very hard to say, but I think we should it's two or three rate increases.  In effect, the choice now is, do you want to move the on the federal funds rate?  I guess I come down on the side of wanting to have a rate.  That is partly just the near presence of the effective lower bound.

If the economy grows than expected, to the point at which the Committee feels that it's getting 'behind I think it's wise to reduce reinvestments at a moment of relatively high confidence the strength of the economy. Another consideration is upside, I guess my first preference even stronger the curve,' then that would strengthen the case for doing something sooner on reinvestments.  In any case, about year before the market broadly expects, then I think that would argue for a more the third option laid out.  I also think there will communications very carefully.

It would be good to reach a consensus on a decision to taper this year, I guess I would be in wanting to have that be a delayed effect and then to be phased in gradually over Finally, this guidelines.

Doing for Federal Reserve remittances; create some policy space for ourselves, perhaps reduce a source of volatility in the markets.  It's also consistent those quite important. MR. HARKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I really appreciate the staff's timing of sheet normalization, but, as others have said around the table, many of in importance, and we are steadily approaching a so will reduce the risk as others have said; and with our stated normalization principles, and I believe that staying consistent with principles is also the factors I see influencing the timing of normalization involve the level of rate, the state of the economy, and the balance of risks.  I would like to see two or the economic risks are roughly balanced.  And there's a Powell said, that we may be in an economy that is very different, one in risks are actually to the upside, and so we'd have to take that into account. Like others, the funds maybe three more rate hikes and that possibility, as Governor which those

Now, work by my staff communication the 'when' and the 'how' of normalization will have yields this.  The future macroeconomic or option to change course in response to tail events, so most concern me.  Related to President Williams's comments, the most is model uncertainty.  We are far from certain with regard to the the effects of redemptions and after the fact.  If, say, we find out that more than estimated, we would also have to revise amount of accommodation SOMA holdings have been providing since 2014 and the underlying economy.

Therefore, it seems prudent to start with a cap on redemptions, as shown in the staff memo, and possibly gradually it as we become more certain of the effects of normalizations.  We could start, say, at everything goes as planned, There are other ways we could do this, but I think to me the Financial markets to me raise $30 billion and perhaps bump the cap up by $10 billion a quarter if soon then ceasing all reinvestments. cap approach and being flexible about that makes some sense.

I'm a bit more wary regarding our knowledge of normalizing market consider phasing in the normalization process with MBS.  My staff and I that option was not considered, and if you could answer that are roughly those I expect to prevail to the end of this year, 2017, when the target range for the federal funds rate is likely to be funds rate counts. To reiterate, the conditions for starting normalization close 125 to 150 basis points.  However, I think explicitly linking the level of the federal with the start of the normalization process would be problematic on several

to start balance sheet it?  In addition, the level of the federal funds rate and the start of normalization would raise the would be or should be a relatively mundane 25 basis point from a funds rate.  I just think it adds too much drama to avoid. First, communications would need to be carefully crafted to avoid confusion over whether the condition on the federal funds rate level necessary normalization is a threshold, a trigger, a hint, or a sign.  Exactly what is timing between the stakes, as others have said, on what increase.  So I am also supportive of the idea of separating the reinvestments decision decision we would make on raising the federal the situation that we can language in a manner analogous to a consensus, at which a clear statement of policy, a consensus in language will not remove all uncertainty I view data dependence as a guiding principle of monetary policy. and I know they hate that phrase, I actually think it has served us well Also, it seems preferable to rely on the data-contingent to that deployed for the federal funds rate until the Committee comes point I am supportive of some clear communication, whether it's white paper, or some other form-but we're not there yet, and we have to form a the Committee.

I also think we want to minimize the extent to likely to trigger a great deal of timing and nature of our decision.  I would prefer to commence running off sheet sooner rather than later, and to make doing that as simple as possible. I think we are better off relying on sheet on a path that is which market participants are preoccupied with conjectures about our balance sheet plans. Today's discussion will appear in the minutes.  I think it is speculation about the our balance to see us simply announce at an upcoming meeting, in paragraph 5 in our a short time in the future.  To me, a month seems perfectly adequate.  That should put I would like statement, that we are ending reinvestment of both Treasury securities and MBS.  We can make it effective the discourse to bed fairly quickly.

options presented by the staff, I favor the first scenario, in which we reinvestments.  When we get close to having normalized our balance sheet, holdings, as we said we could in our normalization and plans, and, if necessary at the time, reinvest the proceeds into Treasury securities. a Treasury securities-only balance sheet sooner rather than later, again, consistent with Among the immediately cease all we should sell off the residual MBS principles These MBS would be a nuisance.  Besides, I think we should try to get to our objective of achieving our principles.

comment here on the size of our normalized balance sheet.  To say that an estimate is stated as $500 billion to $1 trillion is an imprecisely estimated quantity is sort of an analysis, I'd urge the staff to maybe dig a little deeper.  I operations that it only took a of excess reserves on Wednesday afternoon in surplus relative to what fairly low.  So something is wrong with that intuition if it is much and figure that out, but that, I a lot more work. I will that understatement.  In looking over the brought to the subject the intuition derived from our pre-crisis couple of billion dollars the market needed to drive the funds rate we need $500 billion in excess reserves to run a floor system systematically.  I suspect less than $100 billion.  But, anyway, we can probe as we get there think, needs rate at which our MBS holdings decline rather than letting the governed by just the vagaries of the principal repayment flows.  We can minimum monthly rate at which we would reduce our MBS holdings.  Whatever we don't through principal and interest payments we could achieve through outright sales.  That might spike above that minimum amount, but we could set it at an amount that gives I think we should actually consider, and the staff should analyze, a hybrid approach in which we set a floor under the pace of MBS runoffs be set a achieve way, we could set our MBS holdings on a more or less predictable path, or occasionally repayments

I think it might that decision, to open that up.  My recollection is that a decisive factor remittances, of realizing in a rising rate environment and thereby the risk, as would be without any significance, but the optics were viewed as potentially the political front. Now, I realize that the scope of today's discussion was limited to reinvestment policy, and that's consistent with us having decided some time ago to be worthwhile to revisit was the potential effect on remittances-the possibility of negative capital losses by selling long-dated securities many people have alluded to, of recording a deferred asset.  That effect direct economic consequence of any costly on

I'd point out, though, that there are other adverse balance For example, when long-term yields rise another 10 to 15 or 20 basis points, we will begin showing unrealized capital losses in will be think that could easily get as much attention as a deferred asset on our balance sheet.  Avoiding sales is not dollar value of the payments we make as interest on excess gotten significant attention politically as well, and minimizing that is obviously that considering asset a taboo. I'd also mention that the reserves has aided by more rapidly running off our balance sheet.  The basic point is sales shouldn't be

Of the approaches to policy in the staff memo, my preference is for a phasing out of both Treasury and the speed of adjustment compared with a full strategy is worth the insurance against unexpected market disruptions.

Assuming the federal funds rate to rise toward its expected longer-run level on the SEP median path, we should be prepared to issue a revised statement of principles and plans for balance sheet normalization by third quarter of this year.

Let me take each in turn. I would expect a which the balance sheet the balance sheet and process begins, the process for allowing the balance sheet to run off, the govern the size of might warrant alteration the Committee should continue to follow a state-contingent and, more specifically, determining when full balance sheet reinvestment should be the Committee's judgment must also more complicated reality of the markets as well as any unexpected shocks. level of the federal funds rate would enable the Committee to intentions while retaining control over the timing in the event of changes or adverse shocks.

It has ensured that reached a level at which it can be cut adverse shocks and thus help to guard against asymmetric risks By contrast, a policy that's tied to the federal funds rate would clearly signal the to proceed if economic circumstances warrant while retaining the flexibility to adjust to adverse developments through adjusting the December 2015 to rely solely on the normalization is well under way has our most familiar and tested tool, the funds rate, will have meaningfully to counter associated with the effective lower bound.

A threshold below this level leaves too little room to cut too long balance sheet normalization.  Current SEP numbers reached discontinued in the median projection.

reinvestment is discontinued, the FOMC effectively will have two tools to previous tightening cycles.  The revised policy whether the Committee will employ a strategy of complementarity in funds rate target and balance sheet are both used actively, as some have the federal funds rate as the sole away from the effective lower bound. Once full remove accommodation, which is a change from statement should clarify which the federal suggested, or a strategy of subordination, which would prioritize active tool this approach, once the federal funds rate rises sufficiently, the balance sheet would be a 'new normal' has been reached, in the demand for currency.  Indeed, I would argue in favor policy on the federal funds rate as the single active tool in circumstances in which In set on autopilot, shrinking in a gradual, predictable way until and then increasing in line with trend increases argue that predictability, parsimony, precision, and clarity of communications all of focusing the two tools are largely substitutes.

It also accommodation gradually and seems to risk a by markets as a signal of impatience. Third, I favor a gradual and predictable phaseout of reinvestments, at least over the two years when principal repayments are elevated.  While the background memo suggests there would be little difference in the economic effects of gradually phasing out versus immediately ceasing will react.  A phaseout only gradually increase aligns with the Committee's desire to remove lower likelihood of misinterpretation of the initial phaseout would fade over time and then end, it As the smoothing effect might be prudent to develop additional guard rails for reducing any spikes in the amount of securities that need to be funded by the market each month, for instance, by a monthly cap.

In change in our reinvestment policy symmetrically to MBS. an approach would further reduce the chances of adverse this type of addition, I'd be inclined to apply the Treasury securities and revised principles will need to set expectations about the framework that will the balance sheet once it reaches its 'new normal.'

I thought the option of capping Treasury security investments to best fit that criteria, but I would certainly look to the Desk to guide the Committee's and other options drawing on their experience and their own interpretation of Regarding the options, assuming that the differences between the various approaches appear somewhat modest, I favor an approach that is relatively simple and effects on market seemed evaluation of this market dynamics.

The issues that President Lacker may entail, in the view of some people, financial stability and the like-those potential latent criticisms are going to be made regardless of Committee thinks it is using balance sheet policy in an unusual or recession-like opposed to just tweaking monetary policy a little up or down. I think people need to focus a little bit more on some of Powell alluded that were informing a view for a a little bit of reluctance to resort to mentioned concerning remittances and potential capital losses-just the criticism of something that was an unusual policy that concerns whether the situation as

And the shape of the yield curve, the composition of the balance sheet, is one of the few that affect the yield curve significantly, but I think you have got to at least try to think that legislation providing so if you are concerned about having an instrument other than short-term interest rates, it may be that would be available.

messages being sent by hard versus soft and the other characterized as 'soft.'  We then made near-term real GDP forecasts based or on soft data alone.  The soft forecast predicted 4 percent real GDP the near term, while the hard data predicted just 2 percent growth.  Similarly, the Eighth District reported relatively weak activity so far in 2017 but, nevertheless, a certain degree of optimism for the year as a whole.  My 'takeaway' is that well ahead of actual events and that we could do better as a Committee more squarely on what is actually happening than on what may or may not transpire Much has been made of the distinctions between data in recent months.  My staff divided the available data into two groups, one characterized as 'hard' either on hard data alone growth over contacts in maintained expectations are running to focus during the remainder of this year.

A weak Q1 will require significant bounceback in Q2 to rationalize the idea that look to job growth as suggesting a different story.  The January and February have been good, but still, year-over-year nonfarm payroll growth was 2.4 percent in pace in January 2015 and has slowed to 1.2 percent today.

soft data are more forward looking and foresee rapid growth ahead, equity markets are up considerably in recent months.  It is true that they may foresee likely they foresee lower tax rates.  Lower tax rates alone, should they cause a one-time upward revaluation of the U.S. corporate sector, and Simon that. It could be that the reflected in equity prices and expected fiscal policy.  But, in my view, there are reasons to doubt this.  First, higher growth, but more materialize, could Potter's earlier commentary indicated some evidence of

Second, concerning fiscal policy, the characterization of upcoming fiscal policy changes is what I would describe as revenue neutral tax reform.  This change in may not be growth enhancing and is something we could the future, and, anyway, it would take a lot of time to have a major effect on as traditional deficit spending stimulus seems like a misreading of the political situation to me. A more likely outcome the source of tax revenue may or certainly debate, but it does not increase deficit spending.  Any infrastructure spending, in my view, is further in growth.

bottom line is, soft data optimism may be running ahead of reality.  I think the take a wait-and-see approach to find out whether the hard data catch the softer versa.  I continue to think that we are better off with a regime-based forecast, which as something close to a steady state, with real GDP growing at 2 percent, change in the necessary policy rate to support that.

questions which I think may be of relevance in the is:  In future, will the unemployment rate provide the best general labor market slack?  In the pre-crisis years, this might have seemed like a feckless market slack during the long and gradual recovery.  In particular, a lower-than-trend rate and high levels of part-time employment for economic reasons most clearly during the period of more than a year in which job creation was for new labor market entrants but the unemployment rate essentially flat at around 5 percent. I'd like to turn now, though, to those longer term.  The first question measure of question, but it seems quite clear now that the unemployment rate has not been the best measure of labor labor force participation revealed considerable slack, a good bit of which has subsequently been removed.

Now, it's early to answer this question definitively, although I think some the recession pretty clearly returning closer to familiar patterns.  A good example is the relationship and short-term unemployment.

None of you needs me to remind you of the question, but I did want for its answer.  First, while debate will, I'm the Phillips curve does accurately reflect relationship between inflation and unemployment.  The same work suggests like the original Phillips curve than the accelerationist seemed more accurate in the high-inflation period of the '70s.  But that work also for a couple of decades.

While it's true that the bulk of the data don't indicate any meaningful looking-like household and business ISM manufacturing index, and some of the that list I'd add last employment report, which I thought was quite strong in most respects, the weather undoubtedly played a role in pushing up the headline payroll figure. effect of all of these softer indicators, as some have put it, can be seen in the Federal nowcast estimate for the first-quarter real GDP growth, which, as of With respect to the growth outlook, I a change in trajectory, indicators that may be more forward sentiment, business-activity indicators like the regional Federal Reserve indexes-have improved recently.  I think to Friday's payroll recognizing that The Reserve Bank of New York last Friday, was at 3.2 percent.  That's well above most judgmental forecasts, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's GDP forecast.

I suspect that real GDP growth in the first quarter will be considerably below this nowcast estimate.  After all, most judgmental real GDP forecasts in the first quarter to be clustered around 1½ to 2 percent.  So, following President Williams's discussion at the Q1 seasonality issue.  What they concluded that there is the point estimate that they found for the first quarter suggests that the look like 2 percent growth when you actually get the first-quarter Now, 3.2 percent appear the previous meeting, our staff did an analysis of is that the data are sufficiently noisy so you can't actually reject the null hypothesis no seasonality issue, but seasonal-adjustment problem was actually quite sizable-a lot of variance, but the point estimate was pretty big, around 1 percentage point.  So what that means, if you take that literally, is that 3 percent growth might numbers.

After all, financial conditions drive much more powerfully than the federal funds rate. Another thing I would like to stress noteworthy.  On balance, the rise in equity prices outweighed the dollar.  It's a bit unusual us moving a bit faster than earlier anticipated.  A number of easing of financial conditions since our December FOMC meeting as important.  In particular, one investment bank recently pegged the easing in their well-known financial conditions index over the past few months as equivalent to a Speaking for myself, I do judge the activity respect to the international outlook, there are still plenty of places in which things early 2016, when were plunging, which was putting significant stress on many commodity to be making more progress towards its inflation the on their capital outflows are working, or that confidence in the Chinese economic stability of the global financial system, that Deutsche Bank is planning to raise $8 billion of equity capital in the With could go badly awry.  In general, however, I agree with most of the rest of you that we are seeing considerably less stress in the system-for example, compared with commodity prices exporting nations.  Also, Europe does seem objectives, and, at least for now, China seems quite stable.  I thought it was interesting that last month's Chinese foreign exchange reserves actually rose, which suggests that either restrictions outlook is improving, or maybe both.

Also, the trajectory and the relative stability in energy prices also that some of the more transitory factors that may have played a role in holding inflation time being, have dissipated. On the inflation side of the ledger, I also think the prospects for a relatively early to an underlying inflation rate of 2 percent continue to improve.  That's because the economy continues to grow at flattening out of the dollar's upward suggests down in recent years may, for the that the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer a gradual updrift in one-year and this last month.  That's the since mid-2015.  We think it's a pretty good measure of inflation expectations-it it's recovered and is on a slight upward trajectory.  When I put all of together that I see, I think it really does point strongly toward raising our federal funds target at this meeting.  And we will talk about that tomorrow. Finally, I just want to point out Expectations, which came out yesterday, is starting to show three-year inflation expectations.

Employment has longer-run sustainable trend without my estimate of its longer-run level. has edged up since the fall and, on balance, has been roughly flat for demographic factors that thus continued to expand faster in recent months than its reducing the unemployment rate, which remains close to labor market is more or less back to normal but not in certain sectors and occupations are about what you healthy labor market.

In addition, the staff in energy prices will temporarily push inflation a bit above few months.  That said, we should be careful not to overstate the progress remains somewhat below our longer-run 2 percent objective. On the inflation front, the latest data previous estimates that recent increases 2 percent in the next we have made in reaching our inflation goal.  Core inflation has been running close to 1¾ percent since the summer and that overall activity is If anything, real GDP growth seems to be coming in a little on the low side this reflects a slowdown in consumer spending that is probably temporary. My second observation is that the progress we have seen has been in line with expectations, not notably stronger, and the outlook for real activity and inflation has not changed materially.  Recent spending and production indicators do not suggest accelerating. quarter, although that More revealingly, if we smooth through the quarterly ups and downs, real GDP appears to have

The evidence continues to suggest that the risk seems quite low that a further modest market conditions would lead to a marked pickup in inflation, particularly as expectations remain quiescent. Inflation puzzling about recent price developments, and the effects of past declines in energy and import prices have Phillips curve is now fairly flat.

inflation developments called for adjustments to the inflation paragraphs concerning the economic policy decision, and the policy outlook.  These adjustments were issues.  First, the revised language recognizes that headline to the 2 percent objective 2 percent over coming months, but the substantial increase inflation to drift below 2 percent in the second half of this year, and that core inflation move materially closer to 2 percent this year.  Your SEP submissions suggest many of you agree.  Accordingly, the language in paragraph 1 of alternative B between headline and core inflation to convey that the job of forecasters, as shown in the upper right. thought is conveyed by highlighting, in paragraph 3, the Committee's foster a 'sustained' return to 2 percent inflation. As you know, recent language not only in paragraph 1, but also in the outlook, the intended to address two PCE inflation on a 12-month basis has now moved close and may well rise above of headline inflation over recent months contrasts with the stability of core inflation. Furthermore, as shown in the upper-left panel, the staff projects that headline is likely will not that explicitly distinguishes returning inflation to 2 percent on a sustainable basis is not quite complete-a view apparently shared by several private-sector The same intention to to convey that, with headline inflation having moved to 2 percent, the fact that monetary policy cannot perfectly stabilize inflation at construed as a lack of commitment to your 2 percent inflation the previous diction, in paragraph 2, that inflation will 'rise to' alternative B now expresses inflation will 'stabilize around,' not 'at,' 2 percent over the that persistent deviations in one direction or the The second issue is how close that level should not be objective.

March 15 Session

turn to morning's data. CHAIR YELLEN.  Good morning, everybody.  Let's get started.  I first want to Bill Wascher and ask him to talk about this

They were basically flat in to the data for the Census retail sales auto and motor vehicle dealers, building material and supply stores, and the BEA uses to estimate PCE.  Retail sales were were revised up to show a MR. WASCHER. 9   Thank you, Madam Chair.  We received two pieces of hard data this morning:  retail sales and the CPI.  Let me start with retail sales. February but were revised up in January.  I'm referring group, which excludes gasoline stations.  That's the category that flat-zero, basically.  They were unchanged in February but 0.9 percent increase in January.

for February, it does look like there's something to this delayedGooding mentioned yesterday. discretionary spending-and it were holding down spending in Looking at the details refund story that President George and First Vice President There was weakness in both electronics and clothing-that's seems consistent with the fact that these delayed tax refunds February.

from the Treasury on the refunds, and it looks like the shortfall in in a March reflecting that.  And I think adding to our March forecast and the upward real PCE forecast for growth roughly unchanged in both Q1 there's some timing shift in terms of February and March, but I don't think there's We get weekly data February was mostly made up by the first week of March.  We'd be inclined to put bounceback in revision to January will leave our and Q2.  So any real information here about the underlying pace of spending.

a handout for the CPI that shows what the BLS published for February.  The data on the right-hand side, you can see the latest estimates of the 12-month basis point increase, and There's were very close to our expectations.  The total CPI rose 0.1 percent in February.  The core index rose 0.2 percent.  Over changes.  They're down a little bit from what we had in the Tealbook, mainly because the core CPI was just a few basis points lower than we'd expected.  We had a 24 it came in at 21 basis points-so, really small.

We have to look at the prices. that it won't have any major, material I don't know the implications detail and run it through our programs to calculate how much it would matter for PCE But given how close we were on the CPI, my guess is effect on our PCE price forecast.  Thank you.

YELLEN.  How big is the differential at this point between CPI increases and and core PCE? CHAIR PCE or core CPI

Right now, the 12-month change in core PCE prices is about 1¾, so MR. WASCHER. it's about ½ percentage point at this point.

YELLEN.  So that's what you consider to be normal? CHAIR

Right.  The historical average is 0.3 to 0.4.  This is a little larger. MR. LEBOW. Housing has a larger weight in the CPI, and housing prices have been rising a little more rapidly. And medical prices have a larger weight in PCE, and those have been relatively low.

Are there any other questions for Bill?  [No response]  Okay. is going to start us off. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay. Then I think we're ready to begin our policy round, and President Lacker

rate target in my letter.  I have one additional recommendation that's relatively minor.  I MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support raising the funds 25 basis points today.  My comments will be focused on communications, and I'll review the recommendations left it out of the letter but don't want to forget it.

into this meeting, headline inflation is 1.9 percent.  Core remains at 1.7, as we appear to be well within the range of estimates of maximum In crafting a statement for this meeting, the critical challenge stems the fact that the extended deviation of headline inflation below our target has come to an a fact.  Inflation was well As we come was just remarked, and sustainable employment. from end.  When I say that, I'm not declaring victory-I'm just stating below 2 percent for a long time, and now it's not.

rate increase, we added the following sentence to the inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.'  Now, we always sound awfully most forceful central bank communications come via the choice to select to actually state outright, and I think this is one of those cases. so long.  Now that headline inflation 2 percent, the phrase 'current shortfall' is clearly no longer appropriate.  One-tenth of if we retain the 'carefully monitor' language, heightened dissatisfaction with inflation, consistent with our of that phrase. In December 2015, with our first statement:  'In light of the current shortfall of carefully monitor inflation carefully, of course.  So at a superficial level, this might uninformative.  But some of the of which obvious things By saying we would carefully monitor inflation, we signaled our heightened concern and dissatisfaction with inflation having run below 2 percent for is virtually 1 percentage point is not a material shortfall.  But we would be continuing to signal introduction

March 14-15, 2017

the fact that core has run below of core small miss in headline inflation.  Obviously, we don't care about core information it contains regarding future headline inflation.  So toward 1.7 percent rather than remain around 2 percent. Given the addition of language to paragraph 1 calling out 2 percent, the natural inference to draw is that our dissatisfaction is with the low rate inflation rather than the inflation per se-only about the the dissatisfaction is presumably motivated by an assessment that headline inflation is likely to gravitate following question:  Do we really want to justify a gradual pace of returning of expected inflation from our target is 'no.'  First of all, a persistent 0.3 percentage for this meeting do not one participant projects core inflation of 1.7 percent for 2017, and that's the lowest is for this year.  For next year, the median projection for core inflation is projection is 1.8 percent, and, again, only one participant submitted that I'd ask the to more normal levels of the funds rate by citing a deviation of 0.3 percentage point?  And I think the answer point deviation is not what the Committee expects.  The SEP numbers show core inflation stuck at 1.7 percent.  In fact, the median core projection is 1.9 percent for this year.  Only projection there 2.0 percent.  The lowest low core inflation projection.

does not provide any evidence of a heightened concern about said downside, and that's On top of that, the SEP downside risks to inflation.  Now, there's a question about the balance of risks with regard to inflation.  Twelve participants said that they thought that risks were broadly balanced, four they were weighted to the upside, and one said they were weighted to the true for both headline inflation and for the core version of that question.

excessively ambitious degree of fine-tuning, and I bolsters confidence in that degree of ambition.  For example, as shown the prediction intervals that are derived from historical forecasts that appear on page 77 of Second of all, this strikes me as an don't think the evidence in

March 14-15, 2017

is 0.5 percentage point.  Now, it may seem odd to talk about a prediction interval magnitude of typical data revision.  So we essentially even be very confident that core inflation actually is as far as 0.3 below our target right Tealbook A-little historical forecast error plots-the width of the 70 percent prediction interval for 2016's core for last year's data, but that just reflects the can't now.

reasons, I think retaining the 'carefully monitor' language is problematic.  I in the first draft of the statement, sentence was simply eliminated.  And I'd point out that the retain the sentence that comes after that, which states that the Committee funds rate.'  We're not backing off that commitment to I think that provides plenty of signal that we're going to withdraw preceding sentence. For these think we'd be much better off with the version of paragraph 4 in which the entire 'shortfall' statement would still expects 'gradual increases in the federal gradual rate increases. accommodation slowly.  We shouldn't be so fussy about the

I think faces us in drafting the statement, paragraph 2 used to it here-'The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions somewhat further, and inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term.'  So, 'inflation will rise to 2 percent' is no longer appropriate, but what should replace that inflation 'will be at or near 2 percent,' and the latest draft 'will stabilize around 2 percent.'  But it's worth pointing out that the 70 percent interval for one-year-ahead inflation-that is, the inflation forecast for this year, percentage point.  For the two-year-ahead forecast, it's 2¼ percentage points wide. This leads me to a second related challenge that which is how to characterize our inflation outlook.  The second sentence in say-and I'll quote of monetary will strengthen clearly, characterization?  The first draft said says inflation prediction 2017-is 1¼

March 14-15, 2017

into a range from 1.1 to 3.3 percent for headline inflation and 1.2 to for core inflation. So that essentially translates 2.7 percent seem quite likely, if is to be any guide, and that assessment is consistent with recent history.  Headline as high as 4 percent.  Obviously, lot of fluctuations in the headline rate, but the core rate has been as low as 1 as high as 2½ percent.  In that context, I think it's problematic to say stabilize around 2 percent.  Now, I can understand a statement that about the Committee's expectation regarding inflation-that is to say, the Committee's any given future period.  But that's very different.  I mean, the forecast may may be a pretty stable number.  But that's very that the Committee expects inflation to stabilize.  And that formulation would expect to see only small deviations of inflation from 2 percent.  That seems to likely to be refuted. So substantial fluctuations in overall inflation around our target history inflation has been as low as negative 1 percent, and it's been energy prices drive a percent in recent years and the Committee expects inflation to like point forecast for stabilize, right?  The mean of our forecast different from saying suggests we me quite unlikely and quite

we're introducing in the SEP this meeting will turns out to be temporarily higher or lower than These new fan charts do not make it look like inflation will stabilize in a significant for PCE inflation goes from 1.1 to 2.8 percent for 2017. number is 1 to 3 percent for 2018 and 2019. I'd also point out that the fan charts highlight the very real possibility that inflation we forecast. way.  The 70 percent confidence interval The that instead of saying 'The Committee expects that . . . 2 percent over the medium term,' we say 'The Committee expects 2 percent over the medium term.'  I think that's consistent So, what I would recommend is inflation will stabilize around that . . . inflation will fluctuate around with the characterization in our consensus statement.  We actually use the word 'fluctuate' to

March 14-15, 2017

rates in the consensus statement.  And it's statement that our object is to keep average inflation I think the word even though our forecast is 2 percent, we do to time.  I think it's less likely to confuse audiences when characterize inflation, employment, and interest consistent with the vision of the consensus around 2 percent over time, but fluctuations will happen from time to time. 'fluctuate' is much more likely to convey that anticipate forecast misses from time juxtaposed with the new fan charts.

third, kind of minor, suggestion.  It has to do with the first paragraph.  I don't inflation in paragraph 1-it's a relevant fact.  But the first paragraph has recent data.  We've been careful to keep forecastlanguage out of it.  Accordingly, I would suggest that we change the tenses in that 'inflation is little changed,' we should say 'inflation was little unemployment in the past tense in paragraph 1 as well.  This would make clear we're describing past data, and we're not making an implicit near-term projection. I have a mind mentioning core traditionally been reserved for descriptions of type language phrase.  Instead of saying changed,' and this is consistent with the way we speak about that paragraph.  And instead of saying inflation 'continues to run somewhat below 2 percent,' we should, again, say inflation 'has continued to run somewhat below 2 percent.'  That's consistent with language we use elsewhere in just simply finish with a broad comment about communications.  I think this is, as I noted called it 'pivotal.'  The longI said, has come to an end.  The pace of policy normalization is certain occasions to signal a bit of an inflection.  But when we do, So I think it's worthwhile to spend a little extra time making sure we get Let me yesterday, an important transitional meeting.  Someone else running inflation shortfall, as picking up as well.  We don't make significant changes in our statement every meeting.  We don't do it often.  We just use they tend to stick. ourselves comfortable with what we're doing today.  Thank you very much, Madam Chair.

March 14-15, 2017

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Okay.  Well, we have some important wording as people go around with their presentations, they react, to it.  I'll just say my own view, for what it's worth, is that I do think it's think the sentence, to me, in is important don't yet have inflation stable at 2 percent.  We've had a long period in which an important objective to make sure inflation expectations have been low and continue a symmetric objective and we're committed to returning to than a symmetric objective, and, to an important point that we should continue to make.  But I look forward to hearing CHAIR suggestions, and I'm going to ask that, so we can come back important not to declare victory at this point on inflation.  I paragraph 4 that President Lacker proposes getting rid of, about 'carefully monitor,' because we inflation has been running below 2 percent.  I think it's been that inflation does move up to 2 percent.  That to be low, and emphasizing that it is 2 percent, to me, should be an important part of our communications.  I think there are quite a number of people who think that 2 percent is a ceiling rather me, this is your reactions to that suggestion and the other wording changes.  So let's continue.  President Rosengren.

suggestions.  I would say, as I was reading the statement and thinking about where we to both elements of our dual mandate, that there probably is a point when we should when verbiage in the statement was designed in a period when we mandate by quite a bit.  We are now in a situation in my own forecast, we will be right at both elements of the statement MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  President Lacker has just provided a number of are relative reexamine the statement-but I don't know whether this meeting, on the fly, is the point we should be doing it.  A lot of the were missing on both elements of our dual where, over the course of this year, dual mandate-or possibly a little bit under for the labor markets.  And I think the probably needs to change to reflect that.

March 14-15, 2017

am a little concerned about making substantial changes on the fly.  I'd rather do it relatively modest changes.  But I do changes reinvestments, that this may not be the make dramatic changes in the statement.  But I think that we're coming to a point at I outside of this room rather than wordsmithing, other than think that President Lacker's comments do-I think we're going to have enough other that we have to make, particularly to the paragraph about meeting to which probably a complete 'refresh' might be advised.

my regular statement.  I support alternative B.  Even after this consistent with an economy likely to end of this year and likely surpassing steeper and potentially more disruptive interest rate more regularly than last year. Let me get on with increase, short-term real rates are quite negative and are not be approaching both elements of the dual mandate by the them next year.  If we want to avoid increases later, we need to raise rates gradually but much the simple policy rules discussed in the Tealbook imply a tighter monetary assumption.  I do think our approach and communication strategy need to probe the lower side of estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, we at which having the labor market strengthen further may not be While I'm not particularly enamored of following particular monetary policy rules, it is noteworthy that all of policy than the baseline to change as we move beyond most of our estimates of full employment.  For example, even with some desire are quickly approaching the point desirable, as it may push us too far beyond full employment.

the economy seems roughly balanced now, I am not sure that the risks to as well as that of the Tealbook, the rates unless the data Similarly, while the economic outlook are roughly balanced.  In my forecast unemployment rate goes significantly below most estimates of full employment.  Consistent with this thinking, we need to change how we communicate our overall policy stance.  In essence, our communications have engendered an assumption of unchanged interest

March 14-15, 2017

is a result of the perception the decision at every meeting depends on the fine points of the most recent incoming data. an undesirable overshoot.  An implication of this strategy is the bulk of the communication is being done not by the statement at meetings but rather by approaches, after we have received the intermeeting data. unambiguously confirm that conditions continue to improve.  This that This does not seem consistent with the underlying strength in the economy, our proximity to our dual-mandate goals, and the risks of that speeches as the next meeting risky strategy in an organization designed for presenting alternative views.  I an approach that makes an interest rate increase at every press will always be somewhat noisy, but unless the overall signal different and significantly alters our forecast, we should also not alter increases.  And we need to promote that expectation among the public and financial employment and our inflation target, with gradual increase in rates should be unless the economy shows unexpected weakness or surprising strength. This is a would prefer to move to conference meeting the policy expectation unless the economy proves significantly weaker or stronger than the forecast.  The data in the data is sufficiently our path of market participants.  We are now close enough to full interest rates still quite accommodative, that a persistent but presumed over the year

For to move quickly to determine our balance sheet strategy and how we'll communicate that strategy, including in are all for future meetings, not for this meeting, but are all things that to evolve the statement.  Thank you, Madam Chair. So my suggestions I think we should consider as we continue

dualregarding the outlook, I view an upward path to the federal funds as appropriate and favor a 25 basis point increase in the target range at this meeting as in B. MS. MESTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Given my outlook, the progress on our mandate goals, and the risks rate alternative language, I can support the language in alternative B but Lacker that some changes be considered in future meetings. to make three points about the language for consideration at a later date. from the 'gradual' language and simply be clear that, on the our current assessment, we anticipate economic conditions will evolve in a manner that increasing the funds rate, although not necessarily at each meeting. Regarding today's statement agree with Presidents Rosengren and In that vein, I would like First, I'd prefer that we move away basis of will warrant

understand the intention of introducing the language in paragraph 3 about a innovation might be interpreted as our expecting the headline inflation numbers soften a bit over the next few months as think we will back away from our forecast and policy rate path? Second, I sustained return to 2 percent inflation, but this inflation to move monotonically to 2 percent rather than to fluctuate around an upward path toward 2 percent.  If expected, will the public move down for a few months because of in energy prices relative to year-ago levels, I understand why the core inflation concept doing so may be interpreted as a signal that we are switching for total PCE inflation along with core PCE inflation.  If the language in paragraph 1 Third, given that total inflation is likely to changes was introduced in paragraph 1.  But our target to core inflation.  Such shifts in focus have occurred in our history.  For example, former Chairman Greenspan is credited with having shifted the FOMC's focus from total inflation to core inflation in the 1990s.  But then in October 2007, the FOMC began releasing projections

March 14-15, 2017

in January. is misinterpreted, we should be prepared to communicate that our goal remains 2 percent for total PCE inflation, consistent with our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which we reaffirmed general observation.  I believe current economic conditions and the path language to underscore that we didn't expect to be raising rates at each meeting. burden of proof lay on making a case for action.  That was then, but now the economic situation has improved significantly:  Real GDP growth or above its trend pace; we've met our full employment goal from the standpoint of growth is well above trend; inflation is close to to the forecast are broadly balanced.  In this environment, with policy still focusing on the risks of moving rates up too quickly, we need to Let me conclude with a the outlook necessitate a change in our mindset.  Much of the policy discussion over expansion is rightly focused on the risks of moving rates up too quickly.  We introduced the 'gradual' The base case was no action, and the appropriate continues at what monetary policy can do, and employment goal, and the risks quite accommodative, instead of focus on the risks of moving rates up too slowly.

Thank We may benefit if our internal discussion removing accommodation, with the burden of proof lying on the case In other words, our internal discussion should be biased toward implementing actions accumulated incoming economic data and medium-run outlook are supportive.

Hence, is some nonnegligible probability that four rate increases were to be deemed appropriate raise the funds rate at this meeting. MR. HARKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B at this meeting. Keeping the language that if there for this year, it makes sense for us to

I understand the the changes in alternative B, it doesn't seem to me to make a compelling case for the language in alternative B seems to a better case for not raising rates than for raising them.  The statement language suggests significantly different, and inflation hasn't changed much since It seems to do just the is more appropriate. I do, however, also have concerns with the statement language.  While reasons for why we are raising rates.  In fact, one could argue that present that economic conditions are not our previous meeting.  That's not the language that justifies a rate change. opposite.  Language in paragraph 1 of alternative C

a significant reason for my desire to raise rates at this meeting is that doing so a consistent response to what we have communicated about the likely path of the regard, I would also suggest amending the first sentence of paragraph 3 to policy accommodation at a moderate pace, the Committee . . .

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bullard. CHAIR

to think that this is a pivotal the Committee has turned quite a bit more 'hawkish' on data for the meeting. MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I continue meeting for the FOMC.  I think that aren't all that different, and I'm not that comfortable that we're in good shape ramifications of the decision being made at this what's going on in the U.S. economy.  There is cyclical movement and therefore very little reason to adjust the policy rate 2015, real GDP growth was 1.9 percent.  For 2016, real GDP growth was for real GDP growth in 2017 is 2.0 percent.  That's almost movement at all. Here's a different way to think about actually very little setting.  For 1.9 percent.  The Tealbook forecast no cyclical

U.S. unemployment rate hit 5 percent in September 2015.  In the two years before rate had declined 2.2 percentage points, from 7.2 percent to 5 percent. rate has declined just it declining just 0.1 percentage point from the end of this year.  If that forecast materializes, it would mean two years of The that, the unemployment In the past 18 months, since September 2015, the unemployment 0.3 percentage point.  The Tealbook forecast has current value to the unemployment essentially fluctuating between 4½ and 5 percent.

Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas trimmed mean PCE inflation rate in December 2014 was 1.58 percent; in December 2015, 1.62 percent; and in January 2017, 1.87 percent.  It's rising, yes, but ever so On inflation, the measured year over year in December 2016, 1.84 percent; gently.

March 14-15, 2017

is that there's been very little action in real GDP growth, unemployment, a backdrop of policy rate.  In December 2014, the policy rate was 13 basis points; in The bottom line or inflation in the past 18 months in the U.S. economy.  This all occurred against almost no change in the December 2015, 38 basis points; and in December 2016, 63 basis points, which is its level up until this moment.

conclusion is that nearly eight years after the end of the recession, the cyclical almost completely, and the economy has settled type of near-steady-state outcome, which I'm calling a low-real-rate regime characterized to be little need to adjust the policy rate very significantly in A natural dynamics of the U.S. economy have played out into a by 2 percent output growth, low unemployment, a low policy rate, and inflation close to target. Given this situation, there seems order to continue to achieve our policy goals.

not about today's move in isolation, but policy rate increases that will be B today the idea of calendar-based quarterly rate increases increases that would be more contingent on incoming data.  I to think that the schedule of press conferences is overly dictating what the Committee do in reacting to available data.  The SEP has three increases in the policy rate in 2017 but, interpreted as leaning toward four, since some of the dots have moved up. My concern with moving the policy rate today is instead that today's move may set up an expectation of future inconsistent with the equilibrium I have just described.  I think a choice of alternative will make it difficult to push back against during 2017 and 2018, instead of continue can in my opinion, will be a future path of rate Committee in December 2015.  The Committee moved at that 2016 would be followed by essentially quarterly rate increases, Making a policy move of this type and projecting that kind of increases did not work well for the point and suggested that

March 14-15, 2017

reinforced by subsequent communication, which led to a major reassessment in global financial markets.  I don't think we want to get burned by that again.

in paragraph 4 of the word 'only' in the just 'gradually.' by financial markets, in my view, and suggests the Committee may not move gradually during the year ahead.  I think we'd be better off not phrase at this particular juncture, since we'll already have enough be suggesting that the FOMC has turned quite a bit more 'hawkish.'  So I striking this word at this particular meeting and adjusting that language at some point I'm particularly concerned about the striking out proposed statement, alternative B.  That is, 'only gradually' becomes Removing this word may be read as 'hawkish' that drawing attention to this ammunition that will suggest not later.

inclusion of the language on core inflation in paragraph 1, my comments will dovetail with the comments of Presidents Mester and new language in paragraph 1 plays down the recent increases in inflation as apparent in the core PCE inflation measure.  This almost seems to is not moving toward target, but that we are nevertheless planning a series 'hawkish' in I agree with President Harker on this-that this sounds like a reason for us not be setting up an aggressive set of rate moves instead of a reason to go ahead. I'm also concerned about the and here some of Harker before me.  The because they are not suggest that inflation of aggressive rate increases.  So I think that that might also be interpreted as financial markets. to alternative B in this regard.  But any concrete alternative suggestion in paragraph 1 other than what I'm also sympathetic to President Lacker's comments on I admit that I don't have President Lacker already suggested.

for growth, inflation, and unemployment to be nearly unchanged from last year. 2017 forecast is The SEP is not dramatically different in this regard.

That makes arithmetic sense, but face the opposite problem, and that we currently had an inflation rate of with an unemployment rate of 5.3 percent.  We would need a higher unemployment in order to reduce the inflation rate and would presumably head off on a trajectory to unemployment in order to get to the 2 percent inflation target.

The interest then was in precisely the opposite of the techniques are presumably the same.

Third, we could try to take account of our ignorance-for example, by finding some of recognizing a view, which happens to be mine, that the inflation 1.8 percent and target number for the episodes similar to those that would be implied by an economy 4 of Tealbook A.  Well, a large and talented team of Federal economists has done that, with results that I quoted yesterday, with the bottom line to draw clear conclusions.'

Now than those we have that we should rules whose Now, I'll get to the fifth forward.  Since 2009, this Committee's policy approach has been to normalize the economy and policy.  To do that, we set out on a very long march to full employment targets we're close to our targets.  I don't know to what targets other be aiming at.  And I began to think in terms of setting out some feedback rule or

FOMC has in the past typically operated by tending to move the in a serially correlated way from one range to another.  One can imagine that being target is large, as it was in 2009. is small. It's well known that the interest rate an optimal approach, particularly when the distance from the But it is not clearly optimal when the distance from the dual-mandate targets out the fifth possibility.  There used to be a concept called 'opportunistic a concept of stochastic opportunistic stability.  That is, if the to target and you waited a while and watched how things developed and rule that move each variable toward target, then we'd find that that was probably close to an any weight on linear-quadratic certainty because when you operate with linear-quadratic functions, that stochastic stuff doesn't matter in the least.'  Well, it does.  It's what chain, so to speak, and it is what generates the dynamics that move us from one place to we ought to look at that because our policy actions will interact with So let me set disinflation.'

Thank you, Madam Chair.  I can support mentioned yesterday, in my SEP I see economic activity and inflation evolving pretty much in line with the December and

But since I don't see today's rate different policy rate path from what I currently assume will the funds rate today. surprisingly, I don't see increase as a commitment to a much be appropriate, I can support the decision to raise we could end up making just two moves this year, but I could imagine three appropriate if the data come in somewhat stronger than I currently expect. We're still in close to the effective lower bound.  So I can support today's rate move. I still think increases as being We'll just have to see, in my opinion.  Even three increases this year would be a gradual funds rate path that gives some deference to risk-management considerations. proximity

of alternatives that Governor Fischer was talking about, with 5.3 and 2.3 percent inflation, I can understand how the symmetry of that the larger issue is the fact that eight years of running below a credibility risk that people think that this is a ceiling.  I think actively fight against. Regarding the kinds percent unemployment might seem problematic.  But for me, our 2 percent objective leads to that's the part that we truly need to inflation note that President Harker and President Bullard made thought that alternative A was pointing out that, well, inflation has alt-B is a reasonable The following were welcome edits-paragraph 1, recognition that core continues to run below target.  I took comments about alternative C language and alternative A language as perhaps being better. With regard to inflation, I gone up, but that's largely because energy prices are responsible-that was probably closer to something that I would prefer if you were choosing one or the other.  I think middle ground to be in this place for me.

paragraph 3 addition that monetary policy is aimed at supporting a 'sustained' return The of inflation to 2 percent-that's a welcome addition.

paragraph 4 of the Committee's careful monitoring of 'inflation its symmetric inflation goal' is also welcome.  I hope events will in a way that we will soon be able to move to language closer to that in the original The reappearance in developments relative to transpire statement draft, but we're not there yet.

The accumulated progress and inflation objectives supports another step in the direction of removing monetary policy accommodation at point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate employment picture, however, the hard data on real activity that we have in than is consistent with our GDP forecast for the year as a the possibility that first-quarter GDP will begin to look better so far, an increase in business and consumer optimism has not turned into significant fiscal policy stimulus this year are, if rapid removal of policy market expectations, I think it's prudent to a bit more information about fiscal policy, about the underlying pace of GDP growth, the sustainability of the recent inflation momentum.

So before signaling any lean to a more accommodation than already embedded in the accumulate and about

questions, comments by others about the pivotal nature of this careful consideration of language change is needed, and I agree made by Presidents Rosengren and Harker to consider changes outside this trying to make such changes here. Regarding the language meeting lead me to agree that with the suggestions meeting rather than

March 14-15, 2017

As I said in this morning, I would also support adding language affirming the key elements of the Policy Normalization reinvestment plan wording changes that President Lacker suggested in paragraph 1, I also like the change to the word 'fluctuate' rather than 'stabilize.' I could also support the with the verb tense changes; That concludes my comments.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as written.  I'll at the end. MR. come back to the specific language have shown solid momentum.  Job gains remain well beyond, full Since our January meeting, the data above their sustainable pace even though we are at, or even maybe a little employment.  The slow but steady uptrend in inflation has brought us closer to our 2 percent goal as well.

strong backdrop, it's appropriate to take the next step in removing a good job of making clear that we don't view the recent indicating 'mission accomplished' on that front.  To reinforce our symmetric inflation target, we need to achieve a sustained period of language used in paragraphs 2, 3, Against this accommodation.  The statement does readings on overall inflation as our credibility regarding inflation around 2 percent, and we're not there yet.  And the and 4 appropriately underscores that point.

really add to President Evans's remarks.  I think the literature on don't have really good models of inflation expectations, the is that inflation expectations depend critically on actual past inflation, not on a quarterOn this issue, I want to inflation expectations-although we evidence

March 14-15, 2017

more of an underlying average.  So regarding this idea that you're missing in some of the data-in the survey data and somewhat in breakeven inflation, to-quarter basis but your target year after year after year is going to eventually erode inflation expectations, I think we're seeing that or at least the risk of that.

monetary policy is means absolutely reaching getting close to it, not getting around it, but reaching it, maybe that will make sure that we get there, and keeping inflation think using words like 'sustain' and 'stabilize' actually reinforce that going to be higher from month to month or year to year, but we should really reinforce this point that what we want to see happen.  So, to my mind, if in which inflation had been running 2 percent over the past 10 years, that from that we're in today, which is one in which we have for a long time. To my mind, the most important thing that we can achieve in terms of maintaining well-anchored inflation expectations.  And I think that our 2 percent goal-not overshooting a little bit because around there.  I also point-that what we want is inflation to be right around 2 percent.  Sure, it's or lower 2 percent is what we want the average to be and we were in a situation would be just a different circumstance been undershooting the target

President Kaplan referred to, that inflation is our number one issue.  Sure, the camp that thinks we is the one thing on which we still need to make economy, given what's happening around the world, it has I also think, as we're not that far from the goal.  I am optimistic.  I'm definitely in should be removing accommodation.  But that further progress.  And in this global proven very hard to move inflation by three-tenths.  So I think we should realize that and keep our focus on that.

That's why I really do like the language in paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 even though I am very sympathetic to the perspective that President Lacker expressed in his comments.  And I do agree

March 14-15, 2017

we get closer to this inflation goal about our achievement of the maximum'We're trying to get to some place' to 'How do we sustain the economy's strength?'-the maximum once we are essentially at that.  But that's not a decision for think the language should evolve in the future, as President Rosengren said. with President Rosengren and many others who said that, as and as we get further progress on and certainty employment goal, this language needs to shift from something more about employment and price stability today.  I

continued gradual adjustment of the rate, assuming economic conditions unfold as I expect.  It also preserves our policy economy for the rest of the year, particularly regarding fiscal policy, so think moving today gives us the ability to speed up if things go better than we expect.  Of course, it also gives us the optionality to slow the time to adjust to the new data coming in developments. I do think taking action today provides scope for funds optionality.  A number of people pointed this out.  We still have a lot of uncertainty about what's going to happen in the there are potential surprises on both sides.  I the pace pace of rate increases this year.  And we'll have ample and anything else we learn regarding fiscal policy or global a little bit more, responding to Governor Fischer and some other versus 'stabilize.'  I completely agree with the point that we know that is reasonable.  I think 'stabilize around' captures this idea of inflation on a sustained basis, plus or minus it's a stronger version. I want to go back to this remarks about 'fluctuate' inflation will not be 2.00.  I think 'fluctuate around' sounds like something near 2 percent is okay.  Actually, 'fluctuate around' an expectation that we're going to get 2 percent whatever those fluctuations are.  I just think

the symmetry of the goal.  I continue to be worried about this view a maximum in terms of what we're willing to accept.  So I think that going of a range for our inflation goal doesn't work well when I think there is a view that I do care deeply about that our goal really is to language

March 14-15, 2017

So if we say '1½ to 2½,' I'm afraid that who follow the Federal Reserve will read that as, 'Well, really, 1½ to 2, That's my concern, given the history here.  If we had a history in which we'd been for a long time, then I think I'd be a little bit more comfortable with a range of 1½ to we really do see 2 percent as the highest we'll accept. the market participants means 1¾.' at 2 percent 2½-around 2.

the language that President Lacker mentioned in paragraph 1, he's right.  This don't think that's good.  I think the tense should always be-okay, so I tense or the past participle? In terms of is a mix of tenses, and I did grammar.  Wait a minute.  It's either the past

MR. WILLIAMS.  The past participle is, I think, what we prefer So writing-when we repeat phrases over and over.  We'll say 'was little changed' or 'has been little is about Governor Fischer's remarks, which I was following very argument you make about inflation overshooting the mark and needing the way I understand the staff forecast, which is, they actually have or built into that forecast that, currently, long-run inflation expectations are below The reason why we need to juice the economy for so long is not only to raise wage also to move inflation expectations back to 2 percent.  So there are two fighting that My last comment closely.  I think that the to raise unemployment to 5.9 percent actually doesn't apply.  And the reason is that-I'm going to speak on behalf of assumed 2 percent. and price pressure, but battles we're fighting to get inflation back to 2 percent.  If we had inflation expectations back at 2 percent and we got some shock to push inflation up, then we wouldn't need to be

And there movements in that it's not right to apply the same symmetry-that we need this huge period tight labor markets to get inflation up a few tenths, because it's really about inflation the wrong place.  That's all I've got.  [Laughter]  Thank you. So I think of really expectations being anchored at

And here I would just point out that I see it as a challenging and past two cycles have ended not because of high inflation, but overheating financial conditions.  While I don't see that happening today-you not hard to think of financial moving smartly in that direction.  So that's something to keep in mind. The Committee has been patient, and that patience, I believe, has served us well.  I see no real behind have highly inconvenient fact that the rather because of don't see high credit growth or high leverage appearing-it's markets as

I least an you think things are working.  I think that when we get into previous meeting and I wanted to explain, first, why I think a funds rate increase is second, why today is embrace of the gradualist concept by the Committee is also why is a move appropriate?  Well, here I'm trying to channel think, for all of us, when you approach monetary policy, you've got to have a view, or at implicit, rudimentary model, of how these meetings, sometimes we end up debating about the deltas from the what the significance of that is and lose sight of the fact that this really is a medium-term game that we play.

I think we all start with the proposition that monetary policy you've got a situation in which you're providing a fair amount of accommodation, you can't wait until you've That's about as basic as it the debate or the disagreements over the past several years have been over, how at which that trajectory is steep enough that we've got to And that's where some of my skepticism over the past questions about how much the Phillips curve really tells us efforts to invoke past correlations, which is why I spent so much identify data series or metrics that might actually I think do we know when we are at the point begin taking that preemptive action? several years has been expressed-on and questions about some other time torturing Bill Wascher's staff to try to

we are at the point at which some of that trajectory was more assured than it had suggest that been before.

said in the past several meetings as to why I think we're at that to that point, but I think we are there.  Again, I think one can't just be against approach that would say when a rate increase was metrics that I had adopted. I won't repeat what I've point or have come rate increases.  One has to be for a model or an appropriate, and that-I think not totally successfully-is what I've tried to do.  And I do think we crossed the point, at least by the nothing in what I just said or what I believe that to move in March.  But I do think this is a good moment to do it for a of reasons:  One, there is a widespread view on the Committee that rate increasesgoing to be warranted this year, and, two, we've seen in the past that things happen make the Committee reluctant at a particular moment in time to increase rates not because it the economy has changed, but just because it doesn't want to give a having financial instability in Europe.  So there's a desire-I think a Now, second, why today?  There's would suggest you have couple plural-are that thinks the trajectory of signal when you may be justifiable desire-to hold back at that particular moment.

that's the case and you look forward to the rest of 2017 and identify a number of might inhibit the Committee from wanting to the economy, but because of a sense of, gee, does in December are being realized,' which I, by the way, think is exactly is trying to do-not to ramp up and say, 'Boy, things are even better than we Well, if meetings at which things may be going on that move at that moment-not, again, because of it upset markets when they're fragile?  Then I think you do have to take an opportunity when things are looking relatively decent right now.  And you can do it in the context of saying, 'The expectations articulated what the statement

the uncertainty associated with estimates of invoke it this morning.  So at any point in which the Committee is on an upward path of rate, there's obviously uncertainty as to whether its expectations regarding the will be realized.  So you can't say, 'Well, there's uncertainty.  Therefore, raise rates.'  Or, 'We have to embrace a posture of gradualism.'  But in an environment we know necessarily all of the bumps along the way, but also there's what the destination is than has been the case in the past, that this is really important, because it's telling us that we've got to be that this is the right path to be on, and we've got to be giving about what one would have a lag to monetary policy-that first premise-it's going to take the effects of the December and now March rate increases are going to The third thing I would say, though, is that r * is, I think, actually pretty important here-and this is another John Williams point, although he didn't the federal funds economy's direction we can't in which not only don't more uncertainty about when a mindset of gradualism is continually testing the hypothesis ourselves a chance to see whether the effect of our actions is expected.  And given that there is a little while to see what be.

really do mean this not as a quantitative thing, but as a mindset.  And I think it's to continue to project that, which is why I think the language that is in the statement in the position in which you the approach, as somebody said earlier. Now, let me say, that's not an argument against all of you necessarily raising rates again in June.  I important now is important to retain at least for a while, until you feel you're can revamp already about to do it on the fly, but a good idea to do it until the economy has moved and people's views have moved example, of making sure that people's belief in the 2 percent target has Getting to the language, I think the comments several people have made why today is not a good day to do that-it's both not only not a good idea also not enough and there's enough of a consensus that you really are articulating a different approach, given John's goal, for been achieved.

So if we stay with 'stabilize around' today, my to keep that until you get to the point at which you're revamping the you want to change to 'fluctuate,' I'd do it now rather than doing it incrementally at future meeting.  Thank you. The one thing I'd say, though, Madam Chair, is which I'm fine 'fluctuate' in the next 'What does strong advice would be statement, and then you may still want to keep it, or you may want to say something else at that time.

rate, and I'll give you my reasons.  Number one, which I talked much longer year.  It may go on for a while longer. and not raising the federal funds about yesterday, was a labor force participation story.  None of us really know how this can go on.  We've been surprised for the past most of the past year on three different data points to tell me when story is running to a conclusion:  core PCE inflation moving up on an annual basis, inflation the headline unemployment rate coming down as some way of as it's going to go.  And, basically, they're moving sideways, so I'm not seeing a compelling reason to move.  Data dependency means me, that's what data dependency means-I data actually move, and I'm prepared to raise rates when I see the data actually just don't know how much slack is left yet, and 200,000 a month doesn't tell us how it up. I've been focused for that expectations moving up, and/or signaling that labor force participation has gone as far all something different, probably, to each of us.  For want to see those move.  I know 200,000 jobs a month exceeds what is sustainable, so I know we're using up slack.  I much slack is left.  It just tells us that we're using

me.  When I read the in the first paragraph of alternative B, I think the language is accurate, but I do think it impetus for moving today?'  So I feel like the language in B, the first paragraph, resonates with my view, but that begs the question of why By the way, Pat Harker's comments actually resonated with language begs the question, 'What's the alternative we're moving.

I would think that, as a Committee, to the we would want half of our errors to be too 'hawkish' and to be too 'dovish'-randomly distributed over time.

If you're driving down the highway and you're cliff, you go over the cliff, and you're dead. over and over and over adjusting our process? driving along a cliff, you're going to make one-sided errors away from the cliff because if you go over the context, I think the Committee is treating 2 percent as a ceiling, as others have today.  I agree think you and others have talked about nonlinearity curve reemerging when we cross 2 percent. think that really bad percent should be a ceiling, I'm ECB has it.  But let's decide it, let's announce it, and then it.  I am opposed to us having an announced target but then behaving as though it is think is what we're doing right now. In this said, and that explains one-sided errors.  John, I was surprised at your comments with your comments today, but I reintroducing when we cross 2 percent or the Phillips Forgive me if it wasn't you, but it seems like members of the Committee things happen if we cross 2 percent.

These developments reinforce my to allow a gradual runoff of the balance sheet. MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  With full employment within reach, signs of progress some further removal of sense that the macroeconomy is at a transition, and monetary policy, too, is approaching a transition, when it will be appropriate to begin inflation, remains short of our target and has been persistently below our 'Tarullo era,' as I've been reminded throughout this meeting. Although the amount of accommodation is modest, assuming that expected inflation the 12-month change in core PCE inflation and that the real neutral rate is around as most estimates suggest, following today's meeting, the federal funds rate will be only a Even with today's action, however, the stance of monetary policy will remain accommodative, which seems appropriate given that 12-month core PCE inflation, a good gauge of expected future target for eight years-the [Laughter] is close to zero, few hikes short of its neutral level.

I expect, the economy continues to make progress in the months ahead, we should movement to a neutral stance and the start of balance sheet normalization.  However, expect the appropriate pace to be gradual, similar SEP. If, as see further given the gradual pace of expected improvement, the past persistent shortfall of inflation from our target, the asymmetric risks associated with proximity to the effective lower bound, and the modest amount of remaining accommodation, I to the median path in the

We're relatively the federal funds rate accommodative.  We pace, and, despite our actions to make monetary policy less accommodative, financial conditions have become easier.  All of this points to a removal of accommodation at would expect to align market expectations more closely with our views.

very pleased by the to do there to would strongly encourage us to do to move on that path. I want to talk just briefly about yesterday's discussion.  I was discussion we had on reinvestment and the balance sheet.  I think there's more develop a coherent strategy among the Committee, and I just that at the next couple of FOMC meetings, because I think we really want to get that wrapped up so we're ready to go as soon as, potentially, the third quarter.  So I think we're making good progress, but we need to continue language, on paragraph 4 and President Lacker's suggestion to remove that too far.  I think that declares victory on inflation, and I don't think that's with us still being below our 2 percent objective.  I really do think we need to spend at or above 2 percent before we can actually declare victory. In terms of sentence, I think that's appropriate some time

paragraph 2, President Lacker suggested the word 'fluctuate' rather than 'stabilize.' I'm certainly open to it.  I don't think it's a big deal.  The key word in really the key word rather than the word 'stabilize' or On I think 'fluctuate' is actually probably more accurate than 'stabilize,' so that suggestion, but I don't feel strongly about that sentence is 'around.'  That's 'fluctuate.'

the tenses should be the same.  I guess I would say as opposed to 'was' and 'has I think we want to have the tenses consistent across the paragraph, not just in that very small point. In paragraph 1, I certainly agree that that if you want to be parallel to the sentence on job gains, you should say 'inflation was little changed and continued to run somewhat below 2 percent,' continued.' single sentence.  It's a language in paragraph 3-'and we're really trying to signal at this As far as President Harker's suggestion to put in consistent with'-I don't think that's necessary.  I think what

I want to recognize all that he's done for the Federal and the FOMC.  Although I didn't coordinate my comments with the Chair, unlike in some other recent matters, my remarks are very much in a similar vein. Finally, as this Committee, to say a Reserve the case of
