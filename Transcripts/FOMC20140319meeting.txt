Despite the disappointing data, concerns over China, in Eastern Europe, U.S. equity prices rose notably, as also shown market participants pointed to a variety late MR. POTTER. 1   Thank you, Madam Chair.  U.S. economic data generally disappointed for yields, as shown in your top-left panel.  Many market participants attributed the soft data in part to severe winter and escalating tensions in the top-left panel.  In explaining this increase, of factors.  These include some reversal of the sharp declines in risk asset prices in January, as feared negative spillovers from emerging markets to domestic financial markets did not materialize and U.S. corporate earnings results were solid.

credit spreads also narrowed over the period, and investment-grade and tightest levels in the past decade, as reflected in the first ratios Corporate high-yield spreads are near their two rows of the top-right panel.  Despite continued increases in equity prices, valuations for the broad stock market do not appear overly stretched, with price-to-earnings for the S&amp;P 500 only modestly above their averages over recent years, also shown in the top-right panel.  While valuations for some smaller-cap biotech and Internet firms are more elevated, they remain below levels seen prior to the crisis.

Risk asset prices have been supported by the continued accommodative stance of global monetary policy, which keeps funding costs low.  In addition to easing financial conditions, this likely encourages in difficult-to-track carry trades. low in major developed economies to achieve varied.

Tightening actions in Turkey, Brazil, in some emerging markets helped commitment to on structural vulnerabilities and risks across emerging market economies. Actual and expected monetary policy tightening by some central banks appeared to support and South Africa were seen as positive steps toward addressing imbalances.  These actions resulted in higher short-term interest rates, as shown in the middle-right panel. Furthermore, measures to reduce fiscal accommodation to increase policy credibility by reinforcing perceptions of the authorities' a timely correction of imbalances.  Despite these positive steps, market participants remain focused on developments in Ukraine and their impact on global financial markets.  While escalating tensions in the region led to some limited financial market volatility, the impact has been more in early March-leading to the rate seen in the middle-right panel-and has been Elsewhere in emerging markets, focus has been potential have pronounced on Russian asset prices.  To contain pressures on the ruble, the Russian central bank increased its policy rate by 150 basis points increase in Russia's one-year swap intervening directly in the foreign exchange market.

The bottom-left panel shows the relatively sharp depreciation of onshore renminbi, which followed a depreciation of the official exchange the renminbi may be consistent with concerns over Chinese growth outlook, market participants generally interpret contributed to in the offshore was announced this past weekend.  Market believe that the interventions were at least partially unsterilized and led to the shown in the bottom-left panel. Although the actions to depreciate recent moderation in the them as reflecting a new effort to stem rising capital inflows, which have credit growth beyond levels Chinese policymakers appear comfortable with.  In particular, the depreciation likely reflects a desire by the PBOC to introduce greater twoway exchange rate risk after a reported buildup of speculative positions market and may have been a precursor for the doubling to 2 percent of the onshore renminbi intraday trading band that participants decline in onshore interbank lending rates

The top-left panel of your next exhibit reviews the England's changes to its forward guidance in mid-February.

Market participants attributed this than-expected GDP projections, which accompanied the as to Governor Carney's emphasis on these projections in The BOE experience may illustrate the heightened sensitivity bank communications about the outlook as quantitative forward guidance to expectations of FOMC policy, as shown in the top-right panel, to the Desk's dealer and buy-side surveys assign high odds to the Committee forward rate guidance, with the vast majority expecting a change to be and buy-side participants assign the highest guidance relevant to the appropriate timing of the first rate hike.  They also assign a significant the first hike. With regard respondents changing its announced at this meeting.

With anticipated at liftoff, a new survey question asked about to two years following the first hike.

In the most recent survey, the decline in the mean was the largest since median response also changed for the to 3.75 percent.  The decline may be related to lower their longer-run target rate The bottom-right panel shows the mean dealer expectation for the longer-run target fed the question was introduced in mid-2012, and the first time, declining from 4.0 percent revisions to expectations for longer-run GDP growth, also shown in the bottom-right panel.  Separate from the survey, market commentary last week highlighted some expectations that Committee participants would revise forecasts in the SEP.

In particular, we plan to adjust the if the pace declines below $30 billion while maintaining maturity distribution of purchases, shown in the top-left panel of your third at about the pace of purchases, including those that would change the maturity duration target of the Treasury purchases. Turning to Desk operations, if the Committee continues purchases, number of Treasury operations the current exhibit.  This approach will maintain the average duration of Treasury purchases nine years.  The Committee could, of course, consider alternative approaches as it reduces distribution and, thus, the to focus purchases in circulated ahead of the to our proprietary these operations with FedTrade will begin on April 9. For MBS, the Desk intends to decrease the size of daily operations to meet the Committee's monthly purchase pace, though actual daily operation sizes will vary based on fluctuations in monthly reinvestments.  We will continue production coupons.  Additionally, as noted in the memo we meeting, we are beginning the process of transitioning MBS purchases FedTrade platform, which will improve the efficiency and transparency of our operations. We anticipate that

While market expectations for the path of future purchases dispersion, dealer expectations vary widely, ranging from one year increase.  Staff estimates in the middle-right panel show that approximately $250 billion in agency debt and MBS and just $4 billion in Treasury securities would mature between the end of purchases the intermeeting period.

YELLEN.  Questions for Simon?  President Rosengren. CHAIR

My question is on figure 10.  If I'm reading this right, the move to the light blue means that the brokers have been moving down their own dots, MR. ROSENGREN. from the dark blue expectations for the fed funds rate since January.  It looks like the December SEP is consistent with that lower rate, and I know we haven't gotten to it yet, but when we look at our they're moving in the opposite direction.  They're moving up quite substantially.  Do you see it as a potential problem that the dealers are moving down, while our SEP is going to be moving up fairly substantially?

The light blue line is the market-implied path.  So it's not quite what the Those are the little triangles.  We try to look at what the market expects the SEP to dots.  There are a few market participants who expect the dots to go up. market participants, probably more than those who expect the dots to go up, who expect rate will be revised, based, I think, on GDP growth-that bottom panel there. lower estimates of the longer-run federal funds rate.  So I expect the dots to go up, but it's a small set of market move some dots do leave.  How they'll interpret the dot that a very important one that leaves-I'm not sure. MR. POTTER. dealers think. look like, in terms of the There are more market participants who expect them to stay the same, and I would say there are some them to actually go down, partly because some people think that the longer-run normal rate of the federal funds The estimates of GDP growth over the long run-for example, the CBO's-are starting to move down, and that would tend to produce would say that some people in the market participants who have that view.  Most market participants expect them to stay the same or down.  There's uncertainty because leaves-it's

one is about the buy-side survey.

with the dealer survey? What's the sample size of that compared

It was 25 this time.  It was 20 the previous time.  The dealer-

It's not quite a balanced panel.  We added five.  So there's some issue MR. POTTER. comparing responses from the January one.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Plosser.

MR. PLOSSER.  I have two questions.  The first

MR. POTTER. MR. PLOSSER.  Is it the same group?

21 to 22.  We looked at the balanced panel.  So the was, 'Did the median long-run federal funds rate fall because we question.  No.' For the dealer survey, we went from first question I asked my staff added someone?'  And they said, 'We knew you were going to ask that replaced volumes that were occurring by other we've done is change the mix.  Our involvement hasn't really changed the volume, just changed the mix.  Is that a legitimate interpretation?  And if it is, what do I take away the same? MR. PLOSSER.  Okay.  Thank you.  Here's my second question:  Looking at chart 20 on the overnight triparty repo volumes, the picture suggests that volumes have actually stayed pretty stable, and that our reverse RP allotment has just parties.  All it's from this message that the volume has stayed

down. MR. POTTER.  I think volume between private counterparties has definitely gone That's clear from that.

it went down about the same time that we intervened. MR. PLOSSER.  But

We can look at the microdata that underlie this from the triparty system, a 100 percent setoff. more like a 50 percent setoff.  So you'll see their volume in triparty go down MR. POTTER. which we get each Tuesday, and you can see that for some funds there's For other funds, it's

March 18-19, 2014

they're to conserve the right to the dealer balance sheet space.  We know that the dealers reserve for them over a period of time, and the implicit agreement is to keep on using that by 50 percent of what they put into our overnight RRP, and that seems to be because trying balance sheet balance sheet.

most are the primary dealers themselves.  So it's probably in more at that point thanBut what we need to do is look across the counterparties quite carefully.  The set of counterparties that move around the the trades between the primary dealers in which there's been the biggest reduction in volume, as they will tend to use us

Is there a message to take away from that in terms of either, perhaps, market functioning or depth of the market in some way that matters?  I'm just MR. PLOSSER. longer-term curious whether or not- weren't a lot of regulatory reform bearing on repo and how short-term funding would be treated, it would be easier to take some type message.  One of the things we're not sure about is that some of the triparty behavior might be a lot of reforms coming, which will affect that instrument-not people thought before changes were made in the leverage ratio with regard to how it little bit hard for us to push through that.  We hope to send a report to two weeks that looks at some of the microdata, and they could MR. POTTER.  I think if there uncertainty about of caused by the fact that there are as much as treated repo, but it's a research directors within the next probably tell you what we've seen there.

MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Fisher.

Chair.  I have a question, an observation, and two answer was.  Would MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Madam other questions.  To follow up on Eric's question, I wasn't sure what the

March 18-19, 2014

align with this dealer expectation?  I'm about that point. you expect some kind of market reaction if our dots don't just curious have the chart in front of me.  I think, Bill, you'll have that chart MR. POTTER.  I don't that shows the SEP relative to-

it in theMS. LIPSCOMB.  You should have in the handout with 'Summary of on the cover.  As a couple of you have pointed out, the distribution, say, median value for the end of 2016 is 50 basis points than the median value in December, at least for the dots plotted here.  As somebody a different set of people, as one person has dropped out of that. MR. POTTER.  Okay.  Why don't we let Bill go for this because he's practiced on this? MR. ENGLISH.  In front of you there are some charts Economic Projections' for the end of 2016 has moved up some.  The higher pointed out, it's

case that market participants the dot plot and take it as a signal of something.  If you go back and you look at the for December and March, you see some upward shift in the expected path of the December to January, things looked a lot better, and think, is still a positive for the not 50 basis points. As for whether that will have a market effect, I think it is the look at dealer surveys funds rate.  You have to remember that from then from January to now, they look somewhat worse.  The net, I dealer survey projections for the funds rate, but that market participants will read this as saying something intentions that is a little bit more hawkish, a little bit tougher, than they expected, leading them to mark up the path for the expected funds rate a little bit further. And so it certainly is possible about the Committee's perhaps

Well, it is what it is, whatever we have put down there.  So I guess it's well prepared for the MR. FISHER. just something that you may be asked, Madam Chair.  I'm sure you'll be press conference.

Here's my observation:  When I signed off on our year-end financial my little Bank, I had an unrealized loss of a that's come back up.  But over time, is that we will see a depreciation MBS holdings.  Even if they're held to maturity, we're some movement there.  As much coordinated guidance as we can have in terms of helpful.

FISHER. statements under Sarbanes-Oxley at the Dallas Fed, little over $2 billion, and I was happy to see on chart 15 that if we're successful and the economy grows, the good outcome of our portfolio, particularly with the going to see answering any questions that may arise would be may be a little esoteric, but I want to ask the Desk, since we have the paper about dealer financing terms that was sent explain the significance of this financing technique.  Here's the question: My question advantage of having you here.  In Kurt Lewis's out, there was a reference to synthetic prime brokerage, and even though it was an excellent memo, it didn't quite Is this simply a way to escape regulators' notice?  What is it, and how is it being utilized?

view. MR. POTTER.  I'm not an expert in that.  I don't know if MA has got a way that markets operate, in the way that firms take on risk.  We want to it because of concern that, over time, this could become a very way to take on risk that isn't being appropriately managed and measured. MR. ENGLISH.  I have a modest view.  This is something that we're watching as a potential change in the be sure we're on top of substantial

was as to what this looks like, who are, and so on.  The basic thought is that, instead of going to a prime broker and and financing them, instead you can do essentially the same risktransactions and doing those through synthetic prime We had been hearing from contacts in markets that this was something that developing, and we wanted to, in some sense, lay down a baseline the participants engaging in purchases of assets taking by engaging in derivatives

a first foray into this business, to try to understand it better-who are the it-and it's something that we'll be monitoring to see if it becomes a brokerage.  So this was participants, how big is really big deal that we should worry about.

MR. FISHER.  Thank you.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota.

Chair.  I am going to follow up on interested in the reactions, if any, in the media to the documentation of an unrealized loss. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam President Fisher's question about chart 15.  I was and in the public

You have to look hard to find it in the financial statements.  I didn't see much more interest in the H.4.1 that came out the night before the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. MR. POTTER. any real coverage of it.  There was because of the large drop in Treasury holdings held at

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I will just note, Madam Chair, that if people are concerned about the SEP, I think we do have an opportunity to resubmit.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Good observation.  President Evans. CHAIR

page, chart 3, you show targets.  For the United States, is this CPI or PCE inflation? MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Simon, on the first three-year inflation swaps.  I think you made some comment about these countries and their inflation mentioning that it is running below is not as far below as the red line is.  The green line is actually pretty close to MR. POTTER.  It is CPI, and I thought of 2.5 percent, but it that.

What is the translation you would suggest-2.3 percent, 2.5 percent? have experts. MR. EVANS.  Okay.  That was really my question.  A 2 percent PCE target translates into what for CPI? MR. POTTER.  I'm not the expert.  We

MR. EVANS.  So, Simon, your first

MR. POTTER.  Yes.  But I'm not the expert.

maintaining our stance of what? MR. EVANS.  Okay.  All right.  Interesting.  One more question, a follow-up on Eric's, I guess.  Taking the dealer survey on policy expectations, would you say that the dealers are basically assuming that coming out of this meeting we will be accommodation or-or all of the dealers-and we try and ask a question to get at the statement, the SEP, and the press conference expectations about where they are.  Quite a few people think that will be hard They don't have to the SEP right now.  You could think that the SEP doesn't give the same signal.  Then I think I addressed with the two questions I got before. MR. POTTER.  Yes.  Nearly this-think that what you are trying to do with is to keep market to do, partly because changes in the forward guidance are hard to execute. access that would cause issues that

Chair, if I could, I would like to take the opportunity to ask the between PCE and CPI actually expecting as low a number as two-tenths.  When I have asked had heard more like between three- and five-tenths.  And I think it's MR. EVANS.  Madam staff or someone to write us an opinion on what the appropriate wedge is inflation, because I wasn't before, I was thinking I increasingly important for us to have a better feel for that issue.

MR. WILCOX.  I think Jeremy Rudd has an update.

The table that I have shows that the gap between headline PCE and CPI, on MR. RUDD. a current-methods basis, has averaged about 35 basis points per year for the past, say, 11 or 12 years.

MR. EVANS.  Okay.  Thank you.

Two decimal places. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

YELLEN.  Any further questions for Simon?  [No response]  If not, we need a CHAIR motion to ratify domestic open market operations since January.

MR. TARULLO.  So moved.

YELLEN.  Without objection.  Okay.  Let's then turn to our briefings on the us off.

We also think that adverse weather probably had little effect modest effect on payroll employment. Adding up all the pieces, and taking account of the possibility that some of the weather-related hit to final purchases was likely buffered by inventories, our guess-as shown on line 5 of the table-is that GDP growth this quarter expect spending and production to rebound, with no net effect on the level of output after the on the unemployment rate and only a

Thus, to the one we two in the box compare our forecasts of GDP growth over the four quarters ending period over which weather effects should come to washing out; our assessment of GDP growth over that period is essentially December Tealbook.  Nonetheless, as can be seen by appears on track to come in threeThus, in our a somewhat likely more firmly emblazoned in my memory than yours, a rush of stronger data a few short months ago had encouraged us to mark up our GDP projection in the January Tealbook.

With slack, inflation expectations, core import prices all little revised from our January forecast, we have made inflation forecast; likewise, our projection for the medium term.

KAMIN.  Several the G-20 and the BIS held in Sydney, Australia.  Although 20 hours of flying is an awfully long way to go for some productive.  In their lead-up, the media was rife Reserve was oblivious to events beyond our borders, that its tapering had contributed to the eruption of financial stresses earlier monetary policy began in earnest, it markets.  In Sydney, Chair Yellen convincingly pushed back against these assertions, emphasizing the weight and underscoring how, by supporting U.S. economic growth and by clearly communicating its monetary policy intentions, the that should also redound to the benefit of our trading partners, including the emerging market economies (or EMEs).

view underpins our staff projection, in which the global economy toward normality by the end of the forecast period.  In the advanced GDP growth runs at 2 percent this year, about the same as to 2¼ percent in 2015 and 2016 as the euro-area economy picks up Indeed, that converges foreign economies, real last year, and rises

While hardly a boom, this expansion is slack in these economies to below 1 percent of GDP by the end of the forecast period. The emerging market economies, broadly speaking, are already in the neighborhood of full capacity.  In both the previous and current the EMEs looks to have point below its estimated trend pace, as China and Latin America have shown surprising weakness.  However, with some bounceback in these economies, we are projecting EME growth to strengthen to roughly 4½ percent in 2015 and 2016.

Among the major foreign central banks, we expect the Bank of England to be the first out has been brisk and the unemployment rate has fallen nearly to the BOE's 7 percent threshold.  In consequence, the BOE has already announced new forward guidance, as Simon has described, and we see it lifting the The euro-area economy has been weaker and inflation has been lower than in Britain, so we do not see the ECB raising rates until 2016, and it might even loosen further the recovery flags.  Finally, the BOJ is still purchases, and, in fact, we expect it in our projection, the BOJ completes these purchases in 2015 and implements its first rate hike at the end of 2016.

monetary policies in the advanced economies began to could be quite disruptive for EMEs.  In the staff outlook, with the Fed central banks communicating their policy intentions as clearly as possible, to anticipate the rate hikes so that once they occur, they should exchange rates, and other asset prices. regard, we take some comfort from the relatively tranquil introduction of Of course, the events of the past year underscore how the markets that are surprised by even the most clearly telegraphed sense is that, as long as the EMEs are growing solidly-in the advanced economies-and as long as the most market volatility that might arise around the time of policy time we start raising rates, EMEs are struggling to to face concerns about their desirability as an considerably higher that our policy normalization concern, a number of developments have been quite worrisome. As I noted earlier, during our meetings in Sydney, Chair Yellen and I frequently heard concerns that once tighten, this and other markets are expected not exert large and sustained effects on yields, In this tapering last December. difficult it is to foretell market responses to our policies, and there may well be segments of policy actions.  But our part because of the recovery in vulnerable EMEs are making progress toward better fundamentals, they should be able to weather the tightening.  However, if at the maintain economic growth and continue investment destination, the risks are could have adverse spillovers abroad, a scenario we explored in the Tealbook.  In light of this year in the first three quarters of last year First, many Latin American economies have been struggling over the past and, although we are projecting improved performance down the road, the most recent data have not given us much confidence.  In Mexico, despite the pickup in U.S. growth, GDP expanded at only a ¾ percent rate

In Brazil, where the economy appears set to a slump:  sharp hikes in policy rates to contain high inflation, that are depressing investment and productivity, and the drag neighbors, Argentina and Venezuela.  We are if advanced economies start raising and stayed at that anemic pace in the fourth.  A number of factors have been cited for the recent weakness-auto plants that have been shut down for retooling, fiscal policy that by uncertainty over recent tax hikes-but a solidly grounded expansion should have been more resilient flatten out yet again in the current quarter after a very weak 2013, we see more fundamental reasons for structural bottlenecks from even worse performance in its anticipating that Mexico and Brazil will shake off their malaise by next year, but they are still struggling when the Fed and other rates, this could weigh heavily on investor sentiment and significantly worsen their economic and financial difficulties.

With the People's Bank of China rates to fall back more recently, and also having engineered a projecting growth to bounce back from its next quarter, our forecast for economy March Tealbook, and the most recent many EMEs.  It would be even more injurious if it triggered property and financial sectors that, in turn, caused a much A second and even more worrisome risk that could intensify any spillovers from policy normalization, and which would be injurious to many economies in its own right, is a substantially sharper slowdown in growth in China than we are currently projecting.  Based on very weak data for January and February released after Tealbook was finalized, we now estimate that Chinese GDP growth dropped from 8 percent in projection. up interest greater pullback in spending than we having allowed interest depreciation of the currency, we are current low.  However, after reaching 7¼ percent Chinese growth edges back down as potential output decelerates and the rebalances away from investment and net exports.  We had already marked down our medium-term outlook for China a touch for the data leave us less confident still about our projection.  A sharper slowing of the Chinese economy would by itself weigh on global commodity and financial markets, creating problems for problems in the Chinese deeper downturn.

Even if Ukraine conditions and avoiding default on its obligations will be challenging.

today, but I have two questions. line 5, basically says that it washes the course of the year, which was basically my intuition.  So if people look at our SEP is three-tenths lower in 2015 and four-tenths lower in 2016, do will assume that weather had no effect on that because it would have washed out course of the year?  As you think about private-sector forecasts and your own forecast, a standard assumption that it will all wash out over the course of a year? MR. ROSENGREN.  I apologize for my inquisitiveness The first one is for David.  Your memo on the weather effect, out over median forecast and see real GDP you think they over the do you think it's alternative scenario about emerging markets in and Uncertainty section in the Tealbook A.  You have the financial crisis in the EMEs, unemployment rate at 6½ percent.  What's interesting about getting more at plausible little bit more at a for which I commend you.  I think it's a good one to be thinking in Europe at the same time that this My second question actually goes to the the Risks and the result is a leveling-off of the this one stress is that it's different from the others, which are differences that people might have in their baseline forecasts.  This is getting a financial-stability type of stress, about.  But I do wonder if some of the financial spillovers are incorporated in the modeling that you're doing.  For example, European banks have a much larger exposure to emerging markets than U.S. banks.  And so if they are having a stress test emerging market financial crisis occurs, would you see more of a flow coming through Europe? Would you pick up those secondary factors in the way that you're doing the modeling?

first.  In regard to the EME crisis simulation, we incorporate some effects on the U.S. economy, but we don't incorporate others.  Aside from the effects that we incorporate-which are a bunch of shocks to the EMEs push up the dollar, both MR. KAMIN.  I'll go types of financial strictly macroeconomic themselves that lower their output as well as flight-to-safety shocks that of which reduce our trade balance and have a direct impact on U.S. GDP-we do also

March 18-19, 2014

number of financial market shocks in the United States itself, specifically upward to safety.  So those are the factors that we do build are factors that our DSGE model can accommodate. incorporate a shocks to corporate bond spreads and to equity premiums that are in part offset by downward shocks to Treasury yields as part of that flight in, and they possibility that because European banks the QS surveillance report on financial stability that we prepared in the five fragile EMEs, and that U.S. banks in turn have pretty heavy exposure to the a plausible channel of contagion.  It is not one that could think about doing that. You mentioned an additional factor, which is the are very exposed to emerging markets, and because U.S. banks of course are very exposed to Europe, that could be an additional channel of spillover and contagion, and we have definitely thought of that.  In December, there is actually some discussion of that, including a table that directly shows that certain economies, particularly the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Spain, have pretty heavy exposures to United Kingdom, less to the others.  So that's we have built directly into our simulation, but we

if you think about these different channels, the United of capital as exposure of Tier 1 capital in might not be enough to give you I would note, additionally, that Kingdom, for example, has somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 percent to EMEs, and then U.S. banks have something on the order of 10 percent exposure to U.K. banks.  Probably that type of channel alone too much bang for the buck in terms of an effect of an EME crisis on U.S. banks, although it would be material.

economy more generally is pretty fragile, and and dependent on the outcome the euro-area recovery, and if it led to the However, noting that the euro-area knowing that the situation of European banks in general is fragile for the euro-area economy, if a crisis in EMEs derailed

March 18-19, 2014

meltdown that were so prevalent a couple of years ago, then that could truly be types of fears of an avenue for deep contagion through Europe back to the States.

to your question about weather-related effects is think they should wash out within the calendar year 2014.  A convenient any effect in the fourth it all starts in the first quarter of this year.  And then we've got some in with payback, and so forth.  But that all works out within the span from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of this year.  I haven't MR. WILCOX.  I think the answer 'yes,' in the sense that I happenstance of the timing of the storms was that we basically don't see quarter of last year.  So complicated razzmatazz built four-quarter seen any outside analysis that materially deviates from that.

I would MR. FOMC statement talks about the Committee evidence welcome counsel from the staff about what kind of evidence we should be looking for.

I don't have anything that good to see, inflation projections moving up.  I'm a partisan of ours, so I'd like to see evidence that convinces us.  What would do that would be slack.  That will add mechanically, I think, about three-tenths to our projection between now and full attainment of some acceleration in measures of compensation would be consistent with that. the quite tepid rate of only about 2 percent.  A sort of rough might be consistent in I think that We've had compensation growing at rule of thumb is that something more in the neighborhood of 3½ percent

David, let's see, today the unemployment rate is 6.7 percent.  The summary table that you put unemployment rate have the May employment report in front of us.  In terms of the Tealbook analysis, what would you say the

That would leave three employment reports to be received between now and the June the risks are skewed either to the upside or downside importantly over that period of three employment reports.

chart.  CBO projections of the natural rate that you have here, it's hard to Where does that come from?  Why would we be below the historical average and closer to what we saw in the 1970s? MR. FISHER.  I don't plan to revise, but I do want to ask a question of David on the natural rate-the green line on the unemployment rate go back to the historic year of 1949, Madam Chair, and they range between 5 percent in the early 2000s to 6¼ percent in the 1970s.  Even though it's hard to tell from the scale, they average about 5.6 percent over that timeframe, 1949 to now.  On the scale see, but basically you have us going from 5½ percent to 5.2 percent.  So my question is, why 5.2 percent? not rate over time has been labor 1970s, that drove up the natural rate because they tend to have high unemployment average or to change jobs a lot and have periods of unemployment in between.  As we natural rate looked like it was coming down.  In the mid5 percent, and that what we were seeing in terms of inflation at the time. MR. WASCHER.  I think a lot of the variation in the natural associated with demographics.  So when there was the big influx of teenagers into the market in the rates on saw the aging of the population, the 2000s, or 2007, say, we thought the natural rate had come down to about seemed consistent with

by the end of the medium-term most part labor markets are back to functioning mismatches and things that we think drove up the The demographics are a relatively neutral factor since then, and so we have it basically going back down to where it was prior to the financial crisis forecast period.  Our assumption is that for the normally.  We are not seeing the types of

March 18-19, 2014

an are going to eventually return to more normal functioning. natural rate during the financial crisis and the subsequent recession.  So it is basically assumption that labor markets important if you are trying to get a is and how far away we are. MR. FISHER.  The reason I ask is that obviously it's sense of what the slack

MR. WASCHER.  Yes.  I don't want to overstate our confidence.  There is a lot of uncertainty around any estimates.

WILCOX.  I would say that that uncertainty is two-sided. MR.

With regard to the razzmatazz on the weather effect-I love the this a little bit in my go-round, but I also a big part of it.  If you talk to the rails, it is very hard to move trains and cetera.  So it may not have affected wages, but in terms of logisticsassemble impressive analysis-but the effect is the same, you expect a snapback.  But I wouldn't the gearing of the economy and how it was affected, whether it's river transport, rail to make that point. MR. FISHER.  Yes. term 'razzmatazz,' by the way-you mentioned automobiles, housing prices and housing activity, consumer activity, and so on.  And I'll mention think logistics are trucks, to find drivers, et I'm impressed that Charlie could look at a thousand NOAA weather data points and quite an ignore transport, air transport, et cetera.  I just wanted is that I would be very careful not to put Brazil and Mexico in the is in terms of the potential for And then the last point same basket.  I know you didn't mean to, but they are geared entirely differently.  One is significantly manufacturing-export driven-the northern one-and the southern one tremendously vulnerable to commodity prices.  You used them in the same sentence.  I just wanted to warn you.  Both have been underperforming, for sure, but recovery, they are geared to different demand functions.

MR. KAMIN.  I certainly take that point.  I guess I would just-

March 18-19, 2014

MR. FISHER.  Plus, they hate each other.

that for the past year, I, with some just due to a economy is doing as relatively poorly as it has amount of time, that does lead to concerns that maybe there is something that we are not picking up.  So that's the source of my concern. MR. KAMIN.  Excuse me?  Oh, yes.  Well, what I would note is and I believe you and others, have been very heartened by developments in Mexico, by the many reforms that they have passed-things look very promising.  So I have to say, I view disappointment the fact that their economy has been underperforming.  If that's series of idiosyncratic shocks, and then the economy picks up, as we have it doing in our forecast, that is all well and good.  But when the been doing for this underlying that

Vice Chairman Dudley. CHAIR YELLEN.

DUDLEY.  I was going to make an observation on the SEP, and if staff want to react to it, they are very welcome to.  When I'm looking through the SEP, and I VICE CHAIRMAN the compare the changes in the 2016 numbers in terms of growth and inflation and unemployment,

March 18-19, 2014

compare those with the change in the interest rate projections, it seems like the change interest rate projection is pretty large relative to the change in the central tendency and, in and then I in the fact, the ranges.

are basically two-tenths at the top end a change of two-tenths at the top end, but that is offset by a the bottom end.  So basically you have a net change in the unemployment inflation numbers, they are basically unchanged for the central tendency, but they are range. If you look at the unemployment rate, the changes and one-tenth at the bottom end, but the longer run is also being brought down by two-tenths at the top end.  On the range, there is one-tenth increase at rate projection from December of, it looks like, one-tenth of 1 percentage point.  And if you look at the actually lower for the essentially seems in the unemployment rate projection and a change in the inflation actually goes the other way.  If one were looking at this from the outside, would view this as all fitting together? So you get a 50 basis point move in the interest rate projection for what like a marginal change projections that one

together a lot better, because there you to unemployment, and then you have an It seems to me like we have a little bit of a challenge as a SEP doesn't hang together or there is just unbelievable rate sensitivity to incredibly minute changes in the unemployment rate. In contrast, I think the Tealbook forecast hangs have upward revisions to inflation, downward revisions upward revision to interest rates. Committee here because either the interest

situation motivates precisely transparent and very mechanical approach to setting the listen very carefully to the that you give us, and we took that on board, for example, with respect to the liftoff second quarter of 2015 as consistent with your statement in January that and the liftoff. MR. WILCOX.  Well, I can't speak for the 16 of you.  In terms of our forecast, though, just so you know what reflecting glass you are confronting-this our modus operandi of adopting a monetary policy assumption.  So what we do, as best we can, is guidance date.  We interpreted the there would be a period of time between the cessation of asset purchases inertial Taylor (1999) rule. we did in December.  That's what we did now.  So, in some sense, the settings on is churning out these results are unrevised.  And what we're trying to do is project that is coherent and iterated.

And that's hard to get at Committee keeping the inflation, is change their evaluation of what those headwinds in what they think the appropriate fed funds rate is as well. funds rate in 2016, under appropriate participants give rise to those economic conditions.  So it's appropriate just through these questions.  So the reason alternative B talks about the fed funds rate unusually low, consistent with maximum employment and target because headwinds are so strong.  But if people are, that's going to lead to changes may, one point that's worth thinking about is something that rule to the SEP There I think that, looking around the table, on average the people (1999) rule in their contributions for the MR.

He applied a noninertial Taylor (1999) contributions for unemployment and inflation in December and in March and found he actually could explain, on average, essentially all of the change in the funds rate contributions. was a change in the coverage-who was submitting in December and in March-and that matters some as well, but in fact who are here were reflecting something like a Taylor funds rate.

magnitude of the risk?  If, for example, is a recession-what would your expected impact on world GDP be? With respect to China, the question is, what's the we hypothesize that instead of just slipping a bit, growth slipped pretty substantially-say, to 5 percent, which for China

Is it principally a geopolitical-that is, a military-conflict, or is money and, particularly, how much do And then, with respect to Ukraine-I know anything that's geopolitical in origin is hard to trace through because in the first of reactions to a political event-but over into the rest of the it a debt issue?  And if the latter, to whom do they owe they owe to people other than Russians?

and I'll work back to China.  On Ukraine, there there could the global economy and the United States.  So let me start with in some sense the most just an ordinary emerging market economy, not is widely expected to have great difficulties.  Probably in that case effect of its crisis deepening, leading it to default on some of its obligations, would be pretty it's a very small economy.  In terms of global trade, it accounts for less than of U.S. trade, less than 1 percent.  So on the real side, it wouldn't have side, it has a weight in the emerging market bond indexes that and in terms of its weight in U.S. bank hard, when you consider the country by normal spillovers would not have MR. KAMIN.  Let me start with Ukraine are really quite a number of different channels by which a deepening of the crisis affect normal channels:  Imagine that Ukraine is located where it is but, let's say, in South America, and is having deep financial problems.  It's getting an IMF program but the small because, first, 1 percent, and in terms too much of an effect.

So just by virtue of that, those such a big effect.

It only accounts for about 1 percent huge, even if Russia is brought into the fray, but they're getting to be more impacts that are more concerning are the following:  If the political situation were to such that trade relations between Russia, Ukraine, and Western Europe were damaged, it's still not great, around 5 percent.  So that's concern, and given the fragility of the euro-area recovery, that's a material risk.  But the risk that came to the fore a couple of weeks ago, most investors that the events probably were trigger a deep standoff, but that's the risk that I think is most worrisome-that real rift between the West and Russia could snowball in some impact on the economic expansion, particularly in Ukraine part. The deepen Europe is highly dependent on them for natural gas, and in addition the weight of Russia and Ukraine in European trade is a bit higher-though one bigger risk really is geopolitical, and that's the right after the Crimea incursion, when global markets took a dive the following day.  They recovered on Tuesday when it became apparent to not going to geopolitical problems leading to a way.  That would be extremely uncertain, and because markets don't like uncertainty, they could really plunge.  And in that context, the Europe, could be quite damaging.  So that's the

It's pretty hard simulation in the Tealbook that

fell to something in the neighborhood of 5 percent, which is considered quite low by historical standards, and aggregate foreign GDP growth ended up coming in some 3 percent below baseline.  That pushed U.S. GDP about 1 percent or so below baseline, which actually seems moderately contained.

it might not have given enough weight to 5 percent or below, it would create downdrafts in global financial markets that would lead that would make injury greater than the 1 percent in that simulation. I am thinking as I review that simulation that financial factors that might attend those developments.  I actually think that if Chinese growth fell to to further downward pressures on GDP in China, in EMEs, in foreign advanced economies, and in the United States

Even abstracting from adverse weather-I think I'm up to three 'weather' so far, David-the single-family starts and permits data are disappointing.

With inflation expectations well anchored and core stabilizing, I project that inflation will gradually move back to our target over the The weather clearly has complicated the national outlook, but at this point I see little reason to change my medium-term outlook from in my SEP submissions from this year, around 3 percent, before by 2016.

the economy growing for the rest of this year at roughly 3 percent and in 2015.  This growth is sufficient to return the economy to my taken nine years to reach full employment from the beginning of the MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My own forecast is quite similar to that of the Tealbook.  I have then growing slightly faster estimate of the natural rate of unemployment of 5¼ percent by the end of 2016, which, if correct, means that it will have recession in late 2007.

somewhat lower than the staff assumption at the end the onset of recession, we will still be undershooting the inflation target we have adopted.  Such a prolonged miss on inflation and unemployment the return to full employment occurs as quickly Because I expect the PCE inflation rate in 2016 to undershoot our 2 percent inflation target by a bit, I have the federal funds rate of 2016.  Thus, almost a decade after explicit is one reason for doing all we can to ensure that as possible.

caveats associated with my forecast.  First, I want to thank the impact of weather on data for the first My own staff did a careful but somewhat less comprehensive appraisal of impact of weather on recent data and, like the Board staff, concluded that the effect on this real GDP would be rather modest.  My estimate of first-quarter real growth, at a bit been roughly only 2 percent makes me worry.  To date, the incoming data I would note a couple of staff for doing an incredibly painstaking job estimating the quarter of this year. the quarter's below 2 percent, implies that growth this quarter likely would have even in the absence of weather problems.  This provide little evidence of a self-sustaining recovery that attains or exceeds 3 percent growth.

March 18-19, 2014

for the forecast has yet caution as we consider our policy tomorrow. While I and many others are forecasting such a recovery, tangible support to appear in the data, providing ample reason for that the risks to the forecast are slightly skewed to headwind.  Were developments in Ukraine or China to take a turn for the worse, the to the fragile recovery in Europe.  Furthermore, European and emerging markets than U.S. banks and are adverse shock.  Similarly, developments in China have sent disruptive.  I would note that the 10-year Treasury rate has remained investors continue to put significant weight A second caveat is that I still believe the downside.  My modal forecast assumes that a variety of foreign disruptions do not turn into a much larger U.S. economy might face more severe headwinds.  In particular, problems in Ukraine have the possibility of being very disruptive banks are much more exposed to Eastern Europe less well positioned to suffer another reverberations through financial and commodity markets.  More-severe economic problems there have the potential to be fairly stable, somewhat below 3 percent, since the end of last year.  These sustained low rates in the face of an improving economy suggest to me that on the possibility that international developments could derail our forecast of accelerating growth.

While we've been waiting for this reversion to expectation for quite a while now, it would be useful if we, as a Committee, put a time frame on the table for how long we will allow inflation to seriously underrun our 2 percent PCE objective, much as President Kocherlakota was alluding to when he was asking about what the to have more of a discussion.

At the previous meeting the case for a strong pickup in growth was bolstered by an apparent surge in real consumer spending in the fourth quarter of last year, but markets. forward guidance tied to a specific numerical value of There's a narrative that has been circulating that says we're doing this the unemployment rate has proven to be an unreliable indicator of labor market think that story is unwarranted, and we should discourage that interpretation.

I think we're been attained, not because the unemployment rate is particularly unreliable now.  And in

why unemployment is unreliable is that there's a large pool of actively look for work is artificially low right now or will some of the research that staff economists at the Richmond Fed have done related to and it's closely related to this issue. This popular story about workers who are classified as out of the labor force because they did not in the past four weeks, but who are likely to flood back into the labor market if conditions improve.  In other words, the labor force participation rate rise-or, more realistically, stop falling-when labor market conditions tighten.  In the past I've discussed labor force participation and labor markets.  Some of that work was recently published in our Economic Quarterly, model of the impact of demographic change on labor force model is essentially a parsimonious version of that in the 2006 article by Aaronson and colleagues that's cited so often.  It has a set of fixed is actually a little below labor force participation rate.

He finds that the most common interpretation of this underlying gross flows rate from out of the labor force to larger, as the discouraged worker narrative would suggest.  Moreover, a rates from unemployment to out of workers drawn from out of the labor force into unemployment as labor the data. Another paper in our most recently Economic Quarterly is by Andreas Hornstein, and it looks at and the labor force participation rate.  In other words, when the unemployment rate goes up, the labor force participation correlation, this 'discouraged worker' story, seems inconsistent with the between employment, unemployment, and being out of the labor force.  In the data, a falling unemployment rate is associated with a smaller transition unemployment, not falling unemployment rate is associated with larger transition the labor force, not smaller, as the discouraged worker narrative would suggest.  So if you think of that story in terms of markets improve, it seems inconsistent with is associated with larger transitions from outside the into employment, and the significance of those flows from out of the labor available to work at any isn't a very sharp distinction between the labor-force On the other hand, a broader version of that story does seem consistent with the data.  It turns out that a falling unemployment rate labor force directly force to employment supports the broad concern that measured labor force participation doesn't properly reflect the number of people who might want to work or are given time.  In other words, there attachment of those counted as unemployed and those counted as out of the labor force.

to have engaged in, or what wanting a job, and if you do that, you find different transition rates for In fact, you can decompose those out of the labor force into different groups based on whether they say they want a job, what search activities they report their reasons are for not different groups.  So you can document gradations in the degree of attachment to the labor force

In ongoing research, my staff is developing a comprehensive index of the that covers both the unemployed and those out of the labor force.  It job by their likelihood of transitioning to employment. results suggest that the behavior of this index is currently in line with the behavior of among those who aren't evidence of to the employable labor force essentially weights those without a Preliminary the unemployment rate.

So I think we should not communicate that measured unemployment rate as a guide to policy. array of indicators of labor market conditions.  I think we should continue to do so, but we shouldn't suggest that there's normal times.  Thank you.

For that reason it's important to constantly this meeting I asked What evidence is out there that would suggest that our inflation outlook of data that we examined on inflation expectations, compensation data, et cetera. found essentially no evidence that suggested a inflation.  Indeed, if anything, one could possibly make the the one that is in Tealbook A, are actually a little optimistic. This inflation outlook-that is, the one based on the reaction function in Tealbook A-is playing a key role question the validity of the outlook.  With that in mind, in preparation for my staff this question: is misleadingly low?  I could go through the long laundry list statistical forecasts, model-based forecasts, Rather, I will just offer you our bottom line.  We need to raise our baseline outlook for case that our inflation outlook and little more surprisingly, true unemployment rate is now well below 5 percent.  The only significant District are in North Dakota, where the now fallen below 3 percent. This characterization was true nationally, but it is also, and a in the Ninth District economy.  In our District, compensation and pricing pressures remain muted, even though the compensation pressures that we see in the Ninth unemployment rate has

inflation performance and this inflation outlook, combined with our recent target has two implications.  First, because inflation forecasts are subject to facing risks of inflation running above or below 2 percent over the strongly suggested that I think this policy choices, are problematic for the credibility of our 2 percent inflation target.  Having an inflation considerable error, successfully targeting 2 percent means that we should typically be relatively similar and significant medium term.  We don't right now.

into some of the made.  The FOMC statement refers to Bullard and President Lacker raised-the question of how much slack really is in the labor markets-persistently low inflation is a signal to us about what kind of there.  Having low inflation relative to long-term expectations for inflation suggests a country are leaving key resources underutilized. Now, I'm concerned about low inflation for another reason, and this ties remarks that Presidents Lockhart and Rosengren persistently low inflation posing a risk to economic performance.  I would say that differently. Persistently low inflation signals poor economic performance.  So when we are struggling with the issue that President there slack is out that we as kind of underutilization.  The time for economic reasons remains very high by deserves is that the fraction of people who have been unemployed less than six Now, in my view, we can see that large amount of waste in the data from the labor market.  The unemployment rate itself remains high-regardless of what you think of U-3, it still remains high.  But there are other significant markers of this fraction of people who are working part historical standards.  That has been noted by others.  One point that doesn't get as much attention as I think it

March 18-19, 2014

What I'm talking about here is the job-finding been unemployed for less than six months.  Many have attributed low a job, that remains very the full role in explaining low employment. months who transition into employment still remains quite low by historical standards.  And this is true even if one focuses on prime-age workers. rate for people who have employment to disability and retirement effects.  But if you look at the fraction of people aged 25 to 54 who are classified as nondisabled by the CPS and who also have low by pre-recession standards.  That casts some doubt, I would say, on disability and retirement playing underutilization of low inflation outlook-it is entirely it another way, by missing our target of 2 percent I see all of these labor market markers as suggesting a large degree of American human capital, and that ties together with the consistent with that perspective.  So putting inflation persistently, we are failing to deliver on the maximum employment part of our mandate as well.

I put more than a little probability on another possible future, in which is around 1½ percent over the next decade.  What would this Committee do in highly uncertain about the answer credibility of the 2 percent inflation Chair. I would describe my benchmark outlook as one in which inflation returns to target within the next few years.  But the inflation rate response as this scenario started to unfold or did unfold?  I'm to this question, which means that I'm uncertain about the target itself in the period ahead.  Thank you, Madam

The first thing from which I mortgage rates over the past year than I would have That said, I take a signal is the downward revisions to consumer spending that we have seen in the fourth quarter of 2013.  That does suggest that there is a little bit less impetus for growth from the household sector.  And I also take some signal from the fact that housing activity seems to have taken a greater hit from the backup in expected.

Nominal incomes are rising.  So apart from the core On inflation, I agree with President Kocherlakota to be a target that you hit over time-it's not a ceiling.

I would focus the remainder of my remarks on conditions in credit markets and have evolved over the past couple of years.  I'm going to cover a little bit of the same I thought how things

March 18-19, 2014

Richard did.  In my case, I was prompted by an interesting conversation I had with a good window into the pipeline for various sorts of credit assets.  This particular months.  He said that the market was in the middle of a 'meltup,' and there had been a capitulation on the part of some lenders and some investors who had been this point, he says, they're capitulating, feeling that they had no money to work.  He thought a further downward leg in credit spreads of was coming in the pipeline, although this sounded a little bit uncertain. lot of talk about covenant stripping and other erosion in nonprice terms, as well as this was pretty widespread across a variety of credit assets.  The sense changing rapidly struck me as a little bit dissonant with other stuff, but the broad seem unusual.  And if you read the memo by Eichner and Natalucci on market in pricing and ground that market participant who is in the business of packaging and reselling loans to banks and who, as a result, has a person expressed some alarm over what he saw as the recent developments just over the past weeks, I guess-maybe that trying to hold out and wait.  At choice but to put their another 50 basis points There was a some general sense that that things were story didn't participants, it has a similar feel.  They talk about, again, continual gradual erosion terms-that sort of thing.

anecdotal reports, beyond the they're anecdotal, is that they give you a better sense of the local rate of change than of always like, 'This month, there is a gradual erosion in where we were in some absolute sense.  So I did a little bit of what on prices.  It's not ideal, because the prices are said, I looked at the Markit CDX high-yield index.  It's around 320 now.  It's I was trying to think about this.  One issue with all of these fact that where we are in absolute terms.  It's terms,' and I wondered President Fisher did.  I just tried to look at data just the prices, and you don't capture, on a historical basis, the spread stuff.  But, to echo what President Fisher been coming down pretty steadily over the past couple of years.  Two years ago, it was in the

March 18-19, 2014

year ago, it was about 430.  Again, it's around 320 now.  Its average the boom, which I defined as 2006 and the first half of 2007, and it was there yet, but we're pretty close.  If you look at various high-yield indexes, similar story.  We're, simultaneously, not at the lows but a couple of hundred basis average. neighborhood of 700.  A over the sample period was about 550.  So we're about 230 basis points below average.  I looked at the average during 290.  So we're not they tell a points below any historical

I like is, these two guys at Harvard Business School, Sam Hanson and forecasting model whereby you can predict the future the next two years to holding junk bonds, essentially.  The two inputs into that lot of This model has a remarkable forecasting an R-squared of 40 percent.  So you run their expected returns over the next two years on junk bonds relative to Treasuries low and the high-yield share is Another take that Robin Greenwood, have produced a returns over model are credit spreads and the issuance share of high-yield firms.  Basically, when a guys are issuing high-yield bonds, it's because they think that the unobservable terms are pretty attractive.  So there tends to be a lot of issuance. ability.  It forecasts returns two years ahead with model.  It says that are about minus 2 percent.  That is to say, junk bonds are expected to underperform Treasuries because of the two inputs into the model-credit spreads are high.

It's not dramatically To give you a sense of that, minus 2 percent is about where we were in 2006.  It's obviously on the low side because, on average, you don't earn less investing in junk bonds.  It's not epically low.  I tried to get a somewhere between the paint that kind of qualitative picture. low.  None of these measures suggest historically low levels.

the stock market stuff because we have evidence-less so for the stock not making a causal statement, just a situation. I do think that, if we had another 6 to 12 months of decline like we've had, then we'd be flirting with 5th percentile territory.  Then we'd be in a situation in which credit spreads are really at or near historical lows.  To me, that would be concerning.  I would say that it would be more concerning than market, but-when credit spreads spike up 50 basis points, that tends to be associated with pretty bad things happening to GDP and unemployment.  I'm correlational one.  So I would be pretty uncomfortable in that about this for a long time-I don't know what the implications of that are.  It seems to me that if you worry about financial stability, it is to say, you might to let things get too out of hand, but, once you reverse course-and if you're reversing course when you perceive markets to be somewhat overheatedHaving said all of that-I thought policy makes you want to step more lightly both going in and coming out.  That have added less accommodation on the easing part of the cycle than you otherwise would because you don't want especially you might want to do so a little bit gingerly.  You're going to have to tiptoe out of the room to some extent.

of these financial-stability considerations incline me to be a little me as though the most important goal is to whatever that implies. In my own mind, some bit more 'hawked up' on the way in and when we were continuing on with QE3.  It doesn't get me to that same place now.  Right now, it feels to manage.  We're on the transition back to normal, and it seems as though the imperative is to manage that as smoothly as possible, careful here because, of course, you could argue that if we worry side of being a clear I think you've got to be too much about smoothness and about not upsetting the markets, we can err on the too slow, and that's going to kick the can down the road.  So I understand there's not

March 18-19, 2014

bulk of my remarks to the issue of labor market slack, as several I'm sitting here feeling heart of it in our earlier discussions.  The 50 basis point statement and market explanations, and this is about the market.  The first is that we think right. I'm going to devote the others have.  But, first, I'm going to briefly revisit the SEP issue because as though we didn't quite get to the change in our SEP for 2016, in the face of a downbeat paragraph 1 in the expectations of no change at all, is going to be very hard to explain-more specifically, very hard for you to explain.  [Laughter]  There are three possible disagreement between the new SEP and the expectation of the the economy is better than the market thinks it is.  I don't think that's the market misunderstood our reaction function and has new learning true, but, second, we're at the beginning of the The second is that to do on that subject.  First, I don't think that's normalization process.  It's going really well.  The single worst thing we could do is to send a confusing signal about our reaction function.  So that's not an answer we want to provide, and, again, I don't think it's true.

that the market doesn't really understand how the SEP works and put together, and I think that's where the truth is.  Specifically, what I'm hearing is to The third explanation is how it gets that-I'm not sure everyone around the room is aware of this-25 of the basis points are due

Even if they too far, but it's in the book.' what we euphemistically refer to as a change in personnel on Another 25 basis points have an increase of 25 basis points or less.  Somehow that works out to be an increase points in the 30 minutes between the time front of the cameras, some of them don't this time, they will some other time.  This is probably stretching a metaphor like the scene of a nuclear plant that's blown up, and a series of engineers are all saying, 'We did the right thing.

To me, there are would cite the of the labor force participation rate below our estimate of trend and the time for economic reasons.  Labor flows, as With that said, I will move on.  I want to talk briefly about the question of labor market slack and its implications for the full employment mandate and for the behavior of measures of compensation and broader price inflation.  As the economy recovers, these issues on the front currently 5.4 percent, which leaves an unemployment gap of good reasons to think that labor market slack may be even higher, and I disproportionate decline unusually high level of those who are working part

March 18-19, 2014

the unemployment gap more likely overstates it.  I also think the level of slack is even more uncertain than able to tell that the labor market is getting range of labor and other that we look at, and one particularly important metric would be the growth rate For these and other reasons, my prior is that understates slack than usual, so that raises a question:  How do we know?  How will one be economy is getting close to full employment?  To start to believe that the tight, one would want to see some fairly broad confirmation across a market indicators of wage and benefits.

to eliminate it.  And, second, mandate would be threatened in either direction if the Committee estimated the gap As I suggested a moment ago, we care about labor market slack for two closely related but different reasons.  First, the full employment mandate directs us the inflation incorrectly.

Katia Peneva asks whether long-term unemployment exerts less that matters.  Unemployment is unemployment.  The some of the unemployed may exert more or less pressure on wages matters for the a reasonable likelihood that their attachment to the labor force would labor market is actually getting tight. The excellent memo by downward pressure on compensation than does short-term unemployment.  But, for purposes of the full employment mandate, I'm not sure fact that inflation mandate only.  Even as people fall out of the labor force-for example, after their benefits expire-there's return if jobs were plentiful.  So policy should not be too eager to give up on these people without some evidence that the not been made, and I see the memo Moving to wage inflation, the thrust of the memo is that the case advanced by Robert Gordon and others for ignoring long-term unemployment has

March 18-19, 2014

limited goal.  But it also seems to me that risks remain.  We know intensity declines with the length of unemployment.  There's strong evidence that periods.  The rate of job finding declines with the length of in the data that were stable in more normal me that, while Gordon's case has not yet as successful in achieving that that search employers take some signal from the length of unemployment, leading them to prefer candidates unemployed for shorter unemployment.  And, finally, longer-term unemployment is so far above normal levels that we should be cautious about relying on relationships periods.  With all of that, it seems quite plausible to been made, it may still prove right in the long term.  So I would just put this risk under the category of one to be monitored.

compensation inflation a the near term?  The evidence suggests to me that it's not.  In a standard model, real the crisis.  So one might say that the normal level of compensation that is consistent with full employment and price inflation of 2 percent is about 3 to and other broad measures has been wages for near 2½ percent.  The fact that this one indicator of wages is move up is not enough to suggest that the Committee is in danger of falling behind to attain its 2 percent price inflation objective, the relationship between compensation inflation and price More broadly and more immediately important, is undesirable risk in compensation should increase with productivity, which has generally run about 1½ percent over the long run and since inflation 3½ percent.  But compensation inflation as shown by the ECI only 2 percent for several years.  The exception is the narrower measure of nonsupervisory employees, which is beginning to the curve.  Compensation growth is at levels that are well below normal, and a modest increase would be welcome.  In fact, if the Committee is there will need to be a significant acceleration in compensation inflation toward more normal levels.  Now, I'm not suggesting that

March 18-19, 2014

that neither of them is sending any signal like inflation is a tight one.  What I am suggesting is tightness at the moment.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you, Governor Powell.  And thanks, everybody, for your CHAIR observations and comments.  It's been a very interesting discussion.

management, I am committed to continuity.  That the point at I want to say that, in terms of FOMC said, I now intend to depart slightly from previous practice because we've reached which Ben would present an encyclopedic summary of our economic go-round.  [Laughter]  I sat here and marveled at his ability to accomplish that type of summing up, drawing in insights from every single participant during the go-round.

that kind of detailed summation.  Instead, I'm going to do to do is to summarize what I've heard as the main I think bear importantly and that we reference in our statement.  The first question is, Does labor market suggest that the labor market recovery is still on second question is, Are incoming data on spending consistent with ongoing market over time?  And the third question is, Is it reasonable to expect inflation will return to our 2 percent objective over time?  If you look at what alternative B labor market developments by saying that 'labor mixed but on balance showed further improvement.'  As I listened to seemed to me that that statement roughly metrics that we can look at to labor market.  The standard unemployment indicator, U-3, I do want you to know that I, too, have listened carefully to what all of you have said, but I am not going to try to provide something marginally different.  What I'll try comments and conclusions of this discussion about three questions that on our policy decisions incoming data pertaining to the track?  The improvement in the labor that says on the first question, it summarizes recent market indicators were your characterizations of labor market developments, it reflects what I heard.  You talked about a number of different assess what's been happening in the

You pointed out that broader measures, like U-6, have also declined.  And if we look at completely different kinds of indicators of what's happening in the labor and so forth-while they're not improvement, it seems to me that, on balance, all and suggest important for us to assess just how much slack there is in the labor that, because the short-term was suggesting slack in the labor market has Of course, it's also market.  And I really didn't hear anybody give the argument that Governor Tarullo so effectively rebutted.  [Laughter]  I fully expected somebody to argue unemployment rate had declined so much, that diminished.  But I actually didn't hear that argument.

whether U-3 is a perfect summary statistic or whether other more slack in the labor market.  But, certainly, the standard unemployment yet more slack.  The extent of part-time employment is unusually high. We have a debate about indicators may show rate measure suggests that there's still a lot of slack in the labor market.  Broader measures, like U-6, may suggest the staff tighter economy, there may be, as I think President Lockhart called it, shadow out there-people who would come into the labor force. We had a good discussion of trends in labor force participation, but I believe that and participants here think there are cyclical elements to labor force participation.  So if we were running a unemployment

Wage growth has been, as I wage growth as being consistent The natural markets-many of you referred to this-is believe David described it, tepid.  Some of you described it as low.  As Governor Powell just mentioned, we would need to see something like 3½ percent

I've been impressed with difficulty of hiring certain may have increased somewhat, but that's probably not a sign the labor tight. with our 2 percent inflation objective, and, instead, wage inflation is running at something more like 2 percent.  So wage growth seems quite low.  Arguably, we should really want come up.  And while there are some workers, as President Evans noted, this in the past.  You can't talk to businesses without hearing about the kinds of labor, and that market is really economy to support ongoing improvement in the labor market, the answer to that question is 'yes.'  Obviously, lot of uncertainty thrown into this assessment by the severe winter weather and by the that, in a sense, we got head-faked in January and substantially revised up our outlook.  Now simply saying that what we thought we in January is strength that wasn't really there.  But if we compare our thinking in underlying On the second question of whether incoming data on spending and productivity indicate enough strength in the broader basically, what I heard in the discussion is that there's a fact the disappointment is not all weather, but part of it is were seeing December and now, it seems roughly unchanged in terms of the amount of momentum in the economy.

Regarding risks, obviously, there are with emerging markets: financial-stability risks, which duly noted developments in credit markets and in equity markets that we really need to pay careful attention to, although, again, as Governor Stein mentioned, it's subtle do say in our and that that rates, that would impede recovery.  Most of you comfortable with the view-and I think almost all of you have it in your SEP inflation is moving back up to make sure that that occurs. On inflation, everybody commented on the fact that inflation is low.  We statement that we wouldn't want to see it run persistently below our objective, would create risks, including rising real interest seem pretty forecasts-that inflation will gradually move back toward 2 percent over time, with diminishing slack and well-anchored inflationary expectations.  But I certainly did hear many notes of caution about this.  We don't really see evidence at this point that over time.  And we have to be very attentive

I'd summarize by saying that most of you seem to see improvement in labor markets enough momentum to support ongoing improvement over time; and inflation that's low and no firm evidence-but a reasonable presumption-that the forces are there comments of my own.  I'm not going to add very much.  I agree those assessments.  I'd say that one thing I do find sobering is that we've seen ongoing been running only many of yours, shows growth moving up to close to over 3 percent for the next several years.  I think that's what's likely to happen.  But, case. I'd just add a couple of with improvement in labor market conditions in a context in which growth has around 2 percent.  My forecast, like 3 percent or until pretty recently, I thought that that had to happen for us to see continued improvement in the labor market, and I, frankly, no longer think that's the

CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Let's do questions.  President Evans.

seem to have the expectation of liftoff-whatever the right way to say that is-in the of 2015.  Bill, you mentioned expectations for forward guidance, and that's to drop the thresholds.  I guess the imponderable question, if you had any information that we have a press conference in anything to do with this expectation, as opposed to the fact that in April we don't MR. EVANS.  Okay.  Well, I had a question.  I was struck by the dealer survey, in which the dealers second half or de-emphasize on this, would be, is this because dealers see 6.7 percent as close enough to the 6½ percent threshold that they came up with this on their own, or is it because the FOMC talk has most recently ceded this expectation, given that we've said so many times, 'Well, we're close to this, and so we need to be dealing with that'?  And does the fact March have have one scheduled?

it's some of both.  Market participants have been thinking were forward guidance.  They didn't necessarily expect them in right,' in part, I think, because there wasn't really pushback against that MR. ENGLISH.  I think that about this for a while.  If you remember the dealer survey back in January, the dealers saying they expected changes to the January, but they thought they might be coming in March.  Here we are in March, and they're saying, 'Yes, we think that's the thought that there would be a change in March.  So they proceeded with the expectations they had in January.  Simon, do you have any further thoughts?

March 18-19, 2014

the expectations in the January survey are not that different hasn't changed.  They don't know the language is really hard for us to tell. MR. POTTER.  I think that than the ones we've reported to you today.  That that you'll use, and some of the uncertainty is how they might react to those words.  And that's been-it's very hard to work out, because you don't have numbers, you have words.  And how they interpret the words

going to ask a leading question.  Don't you think it's Chair Yellen's first meeting, people view that as an opportunity to do something meeting? VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I'm that, as more to the statement than if it was just a random logic we've used ourselves a lot, and, on the margin, moving parts when the first press conference from a new Chair.  So I'm not sure how to weight those moving logic, which is that it is much easier for us to think of a change at this MR. POTTER.  I think that's the they would definitely understand changes that way.  There are lots of other it's parts with the internal point.

This radical, but I wonder if we should rethink the SEP and not hand out the SEP at this forward guidance consistent with what we're doing for the SEP.  I know that is somewhat MR. ROSENGREN.  Governor Powell and President Kocherlakota highlighted the challenge of forward guidance at concerning optimal policy, which may or may not be consistent with the is a little bit meeting, saying that we are going to revamp the process and think more carefully about how we make

At some point, we're going to have first meeting.  Saying that we need to revamp it and we're going to take the whole lot of support, but we should think about alternatives.  In effect, you may have to be saying, 'I'm disregarding the if the two aren't congruent. This is your time now to do it-judging from the faces, I'm not seeing a at least SEP, and you should focus on the statement.'  That is going to be an awkward conversation, I would think,

question whyMR. POTTER.  There's no expectation of that.  So that would be a big shock, and then everyone would ask the

MR. ENGLISH.  'How bad was it?'

I do think that there is a the SEP that isn't so bad.  You have to remind people that we're looking We had a lot of good news from December to this is captured by the dealer survey-see the outlook as a bit better.  Our policy is there should be some MR. ENGLISH.  Maybe I'm being a little Pollyanna-ish, but story behind what's in from December to March, not January to March. January, and we got some not-so-good news from January to March.  But, on balance, you and markets-as data dependent and should be data dependent, so it's not wrong that

DUDLEY.  The outlook is so marginally different. VICE CHAIRMAN

I think that's what we saw in June, and you hear that from the market just a little bit-that it's hard to change the forward guidance without direction that this is going. MR. POTTER.  I think that's definitely one way that in June was might be, a little bit, to bound.  And there might as things people in sending a slightly hawkish signal, because it's pretty hard to send a dovish signal from changing the forward guidance in the

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes-thank you, Madam Bill English is saying.  The question is, how appropriate the behavior of one or two people near the middle In fact-and this second part of the 16 respondents moved their fed funds rate

Revealing that will pretty much say, 'Look, the Committee is not moving very much.'  And if people feel comfortable with your saying that, I think that the way, that we should be rethinking the SEP, but I don't think tonight's

DUDLEY.  Or you don't think we'll finish the task by VICE CHAIRMAN 2:00 tomorrow afternoon.

YELLEN.  How do people feel about my making such a statement in the press We normally don't say anything about how individuals have changed their views. CHAIR conference?

DUDLEY.  I think it's okay because you're characterizing it as a there are two messages.  First, don't overweight the SEP.  Pay to what the statement is, because the statement is the decision of the Committee.  And SEP overstates the degree of change among the members of the Committee.  I think VICE CHAIRMAN broad group.  But, of course, the downside is, then you're reinforcing that the SEP has meaning. So my personal opinion is that attention second, the you really want to have both messages.

is, actually, this is a great example MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I think the way to say that of how the median of the SEP is misleading because it's so sensitive to one or two people, and here we have 13 of the 16 not really changing very much.  So that could be a way to tell the story that emphasizes both of the messages.

in that sense, because that person, I think, was lower than the median. MR. POTTER.  But you might get the question about the person who left.  That's unfortunate that question. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  You can't answer

YELLEN.  Well, I'm not going to say anything about that person, but I can point not the exact same group of people. CHAIR out that it's

And it would be nice to condition be less paranoid about a tiny hawkish move in our forward what's embedded in the SEP.  We've been paranoid about that since April 2012, MR. LACKER.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman Dudley.

pay too much attention to is when, in fact, there's huge uncertainty about what's going to happen the other problem with it as a device. The other problem with the SEP is, it basically makes people what the modal forecast two and a half years out.  So that's wondering if we'd have the same discussion if the outlook had moved down.  It just seems as though there's an MR. LACKER.  I'm marginally improved but the dots had asymmetry in it, so-

YELLEN.  Good morning, everybody.  I think we're now ready to go directly CHAIR into the policy round.  So let me begin with President Rosengren.

alternative B.  The weak continued measured approach to tapering. for changing our tapering strategy either up or down.  To have been weaker than I anticipated in my December SEP. MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support incoming data since December certainly justify a There should be a very high hurdle date, the incoming data was an important and useful addition.  It makes clear that we could well reach our unemployment threshold within a few months, thus requiring an updating of our important to be clear that this is an update in language, not a meeting.  While I would that deferred liftoff in short-term rates to when we are within one year that time, I expect we will be approximately one year from my estimate of full Adding paragraph 7 to alternative B that the intent of the language changes is simply to reflect the reality 6½ percent forward guidance.  However, it is change in the policy content of the forward guidance from our previous have preferred language of reaching full employment, the language of 'a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends' is consistent with my current assessment that liftoff should occur toward the end of 2015.  At employment, and we will still be undershooting our inflation target.  Thank you.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Plosser. CHAIR

B today.  While I've argued for some speedup in the pace of tapering in the past, I laid the groundwork for that.  With the weather affecting the the forecast begins to change.  But, future options might be if the forecasts MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  At this meeting, I'm generally supportive of alternative want to acknowledge that we've not data, it's not the right time to initiate such a change unless thinking ahead, I believe we ought to consider what our

March 18-19, 2014

if the headwinds dissipate faster than, in fact, we anticipate. contemplate the idea that, down the road, we change and to review that at each meeting.  That would allow us to end the program a few months than in the current schedule, but it's something we might want to keep in mind as a way to should the data suggest we need to do that. play out better than we expect or And one small correction we can make is to the tapering from $10 billion a meeting to $10 billion a month on a regular schedule continue earlier tweak the path a little bit up faster than we purchases end.  The drop in the unemployment rate has been much had been earlier anticipating, and our language needs to up more quickly, if necessary, to achieve our longer-term goals.  In part, in paragraph 5, in which we say, 'The anticipate, based on its current assessment of these factors, that it likely to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate for a the word 'current' before in stone, and that this, in fact, can and that the path is not immutable I do think we need to keep in mind that interest rates may need to move currently anticipate after quicker during the recovery than we suggest that, even though our current anticipation is that rates will rise very gradually, we are prepared to move them this leads me to favor the suggestion on the language in paragraph 5 in which we insert 'current' before 'assessment'-the 'current assessment' said that this is what we expect.  And that would necessitate changing-to be a little more precise, Committee continues to will be appropriate to maintain the 0 considerable time after the asset purchase program ends.'  So inserting 'target range' adds the notion that somehow this is not set perhaps will change.  So I'm in favor of that.  Again, it emphasizes in some sense.

This begins and should change as we get closer strategy, I really believe, is a journey.  It's not a one-time thing.  And we communications to our goals, being more articulate and careful more important.  As I mentioned yesterday in President Williams's remarks, as we get closer, being able to refine our reaction should continue to try As I alluded to yesterday, as we get closer about our reaction function is going to become reference to function and give more information about it should be important, and we to do that.

revised language that came out on Monday afternoon, I like the way to say what we intended.  I find the first it was as originally written, so I like paragraph 7. Regarding the other simplification of paragraph 7.  I find that a better sentence much less confusing than language of alternative B.  In particular, I lower than their normal long-run levels, even inflation and employment goals are met.  The concern that we've not really fully among ourselves is, what are the reasons that we anticipate this?  I think people have run?  That could be, except the SEP doesn't show much.  It's still very high.  So perhaps those there headwinds?  If so, what are those headwinds, and how headwinds showing up I would prefer one other simplification in the think we should consider dropping the second sentence of paragraph 6, in red.  This sentence says that we anticipate keeping short-term rates after our discussed different rationales for that, all of them worth considering.  And is this because we expect lowerthan-normal equilibrium real rates in the long that we've lowered our long-run neutral rate very stories need to be reconciled.  Are will we determine whether they have dissipated or not?  Why aren't those

March 18-19, 2014

Or are we simply relying on some estimates of future shocks that we haven't in the gaps? identified that are leading to this particular outcome?

there are lots of different stories one can put together about why we believe as a the appropriate path.  But I suspect that different participants have things, and I worry about elevating a feature of the SEP into our in the past, and the SEP has shown this phenomenon We've talked a little bit about it.

We haven't done that for some time. elevating features of the SEP into our statement.

of these things in the press conference.  I worry the statement.  I worry that what we're doing is misinterpreting the and it isn't.  It's not a consensus forecast.  It's something completely talk as if it's a consensus forecast is two things.  So I think we just have to be very careful about where in a spot that we may regret later.  Once we've had there is some consensus on the mechanism that we think is driving this as though we have to I don't mind if Chair Yellen says some about putting them, in fact, in SEP.  We're slipping into a mode in which we are wanting to use the SEP as somehow a consensus forecast, different.  And I worry that tripping over ourselves to act or perhaps a dangerous place to go, because we may find ourselves subsequently in an awkward position trying to match these we go here and that we don't find ourselves further discussions and lower path, that's fine-then we do it.  But I don't think we ought to feel do it until we have those kinds of agreements.

we include the rates below.'  I see no reason to say interest rates.'  I think we should say that we should set our targeted federal funds My final comment on language is also with regard to paragraph 6.  If second sentence of paragraph 6, as most people seem to want to do, I would strongly urge us not to use the language referring to 'keeping short-term interest 'short-term

think we want to convey that, so that's one reason not to do that.  The second reason not market participants might be inclined to interpret that statement as signal and having markets interpret it that way.  We're referring to the federal funds as our instrument, so that's what we ought to say.  The language should read 'The levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the targeted federal normal in the longer run.'  So I think it ought to rate below the neutral rate.  That's our instrument.  We don't control all short-term interest rates. I don't to do that is, some foreshadowing something about operating procedures down the road.  I don't think we want to risk doing that.  We haven't made that decision.  I don't think we want to be taking the risk of sending that rate Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandateconsistent funds rate below levels the Committee views as be 'the targeted federal funds rate,' not 'short-term interest rates.'  Those are my comments, Madam Chair.  Thank you.

I support the substance of alternative B, the forward guidance, starting with tests of changes should be that the new language preserves the present level and avoids inadvertent tightening, goes as far as possible to public expectations, and establishes a durable qualitative MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam so let me just move to offer some thoughts on how to change paragraph 5.  In my thinking, the accommodation at achieve alignment of the FOMC and framework under the baseline scenario for evolving guidance as needed.

on a preset can foresee holding to this language for another couple of meetings, but, at think it will have to be adjusted. In paragraph 4, I'd support keeping the current 'measured steps' and 'not course' verbiage.  I some point in the year, I

Today, based on various the course of tapering and the liftoff projections inferred from the SEP, in then this may have to be I also support the transition in today's statement to reliance on the phrase 'wide range of information' in paragraph 5.  Likewise, I would keep the 'considerable purchase program ends' guidance.  I do suggest, however, that the Committee think about the question of specific communications about my view, expectations are grounded in an interpretation of 'considerable time' as meaning six months.  If we want 'considerable time' to be more flexible, communicated in some way.

on the post-liftoff path of policy in paragraph 6, like President I have some reservations-not the same reservations-about the inclusion of the last piece of guidance in reserve to use if adjusting it's required at this time. also concerned that introducing at this time the subject of the post-liftoff path of the policy interpretation that our intent is to be less accommodative.  I would Regarding the guidance Plosser, sentence in today's statement.  I think we could hold this and when the Committee decides that conditions require augmenting or accommodation.  The language has stimulus value, and I'm not sure I'm rate might encourage an simply append the first sentence of paragraph 6 to the end of paragraph 5 and drop the second sentence.

that the Committee would be well advised to think might evolve.  So let me offer these thoughts. on time, assuming the economy is conforming to the basic outlook, the Committee Beyond today's statement, I believe ahead a few meetings and envision how guidance As I've already commented, I can see the Committee changing the 'measured steps' and 'not a preset course' guidance to something more concrete and predictive in the July or September meeting.  By that

Regarding the 'considerable time' guidance, it to 'after language could be retained as straightforward qualitative guidance about today's alternative B, paragraph 5, language is a sufficiently durable That is to say, I'm not introduce new elements that might turn out to be I'm satisfied that framework within which to make necessary adjustments as time passes. satisfied that the new language does awkward or troublesome in future months.

Alternative B continuity in policy, while successfully navigating the transition from quantitative statements about forward guidance.  In addition, the wording is robust it can be used for quite some time, under the likely evolution of the economy. MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I strongly support alternative B.  Data since our inflation, So I support a further measured reduction in the guidance provides this to qualitative guidance.  Importantly, the new qualitative language in paragraph 5 is completely consistent with our past enough that

March 18-19, 2014

the views expressed by the Committee, and, importantly, it does not tie us to a specific rationale.  It also makes clear this is our current assessment, which might change over time. Paragraph 6 then provides further clarity about our post-liftoff funds rate expectations.  I see it as consistent with commit us prematurely to a particular path or that

7 guards against the risk that markets may misinterpret the new statement. to infer whether we're signaling a change in policy inference problem 'off the table' by Paragraph Any time we modify language, markets have or simply responding to events.  Paragraph 7 takes that being explicit about continuity in our policy.

in paragraph 5, in my view, it's not necessary to be assessment.  I think that goes without saying.  So I'd omit that second bracketed choice, we can continue to refer to the 'current' target as really an editorial distinction, and I'm actually fine with either way. In terms of the bracketed language explicit that it's our 'current' word, and then, in the range.  But I view this

President Plosser's comment about the targeted federal funds rate in thought about that carefully before, and I think it's a good point and, no doubt, thorough had that discussion, and we've not expressed to the public what our I think that switching to 'short-term interest rates' could be a little confusing think that there is a potential here for the question In terms of paragraph 6, I actually hadn't that, instead of saying 'keeping short-term interest rates,' we should say 'keeping the targeted federal funds rate.'  Now, I recognize that we are going to have a robust and comprehensive discussion on this issue of what our future policy framework should be.  But, at this time, we haven't framework will be. at this time.  If we do decide to go to a framework of not using the federal funds rate as our instrument, then, of course, we can change this language to say 'short-term interest rates.'  I don't think that would be confusing.  I actually

My preference today is to retain January forward guidance with thresholds in paragraph 5 and maintain this policy language 6½ percent or inflation rises to 2½ percent.  This statement remains fully serviceable even if unemployment falls quickly, owing to our additional that the funds rate will remain at zero well past the time that unemployment falls below appears to be perhaps a 50 percent probability that unemployment will the time of our June meeting, changing this language today as in B prematurely risks an adverse market interpretation, in my opinion. MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I it's our until the unemployment rate falls to language guidance 6½ percent.  Since there remain above 6½ percent at alternative concern today is that alternative B, along with the SEP release, looks like a SEP median federal funds rate dot in than in December.  From yesterday's discussion, I accept that the I think the enough guidance to validate the dealer survey expectations. envision a funds rate liftoff in the second half of the more likely values of the unemployment rate at My biggest tightening in our monetary policy stance.  This round's 2016 is 50 basis points higher dealers and financial markets are prepared for a change in our forward guidance, but current alternative B language is not The dealer survey implies that markets have priced in a very strong degree of financial accommodation.  For example, the dealers 2015.  They also expect the funds rate liftoff to occur four quarters after the end of QE3 purchases.  The survey also suggests that liftoff are below 6 percent.  These observations seem important to me.  If our statement is as

It repeats and inflation data, and that's pretty much it. can believe that markets are today, but I worry a lot that this guidance is too medians that we're going to Turning to more-specific elements of alternative sentence of paragraph 5 is about that our goals are to support maximum employment and a 2 percent inflation objective, the third sentence says that we will assess a range of labor Frankly, this formulation is very much like our June 2011 language before we embarked on stronger forward guidance.  Maybe that's the choice.  Yes, I expecting us to change our forward guidance weak to maintain their expectations, especially given the SEP release.

This that we have symmetrical preferences for inflation over the long One way to strengthen the forward guidance would be to include the 2 percent floor from alternative A.  In my opinion, this addition would move further toward maintaining our prior stance of accommodation, albeit with a slightly different adopting this particular inflation floor following a long period of below-target inflation, the Committee would strongly advance would help remind the public run.

But I also think the earlier, fuller Tealbook version of paragraph 7 would have helped a lot.  I realize that many participants

a good idea if you retain the most important elements.  But, this is a pig we are working with.  The statement is long and ugly, and it will always, the policy description sounds like look, once you're involved in dressing a pig [laughter], no amount of lipstick is going to change the fact that almost surely, be that way.

This inflation rates, worries doesn't happen involves accepting more risk.  This meeting is one of that we are pursuing goal-oriented monetary policy period of To part of paragraph 7 was repeating explicitly our prior commitment that the funds rate remain at zero well past would have been separate from our linkage with the end of asset purchases later this fall.  That additional commentary would prove useful if labor market improvement stalls over the next six months.  A labor market stall, combined with a continuation of 1 percent me, and hoping that that those opportunities to meaningfully reinforce to reattain both maximum employment and price stability within a reasonably short time.

I said at the outset, my preference today is to simply update our January inadvertent policy is to adopt the 2 percent inflation floor from A.  This choice would show that we're defending our inflation objective from below. to revert to the original Tealbook alternative B language for the fuller would include a reference to keeping the funds rate at zero 6½ percent.

In order to strengthen alternative B enough to reduce the risk of an tightening, two changes could help.  One change alternative The other change is version of paragraph 7.  This choice well past the time that unemployment falls below

In addition, regarding the commentary about paragraph 6, I agree with the suggestion that mentioning the funds rate After all, Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo. CHAIR

pause, as they did President Evans.  I had thought that, with a set of SEP market expectations, the somewhat general in alternative B would be fine.  And I, on balance, think that's probably still where we are going to be more difficulties. MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B, although the SEP results do give me some results that didn't vary much from last time or from language should land.  But there

To a considerable extent, this is going to fall on the Chair to make the explanations on paragraph 5 and, to some degree, on paragraph 7.  It may be that an explanation or elaboration of paragraph 7 can reinforce the point President Evans made that, at this juncture at least, the guidance we've had to date is still operative because we haven't passed the threshold.

my comments on paragraph 6, however.  I actually think a case critical that something along statement.  For one thing, without such a provision, that will determine when the rate will start to rise, and we'll to how steeply it may rise, but we won't have identified what I want to spend most of can be made to strengthen paragraph 6.  But, more important, it's the lines of paragraph 6 be included in this we will have identified the factors have noted some expectations as we expect the endpoint of that process to be.

might have said that such a specification would be unnecessary if the shared rate will be the same as it was supposed to be before Now, one assumption is that our equilibrium interest the crisis-say, 2 percent above the inflation target, for a total of 4 percent.  But such an

March 18-19, 2014

it is, the SEP yesterday tendency of the Committee's projections has the economy at or close to couple of exceptions, the federal funds rate to be below 4 percent and, in most to be explained to markets and to the explanation has got to be that, individually and in the aggregate, we think there are reasons why the equilibrium rate in 2016, and for at least some period thereafter, will be assumption would be inconsistent with our own stated expectations.  Imperfect as does communicate something about our individual and aggregated expectations.  We've just been talking about the difficulties the current results may create.  The results presented show that the central both full employment and 2 percent inflation by 2016.  And yet, with a everyone on the Committee expects cases, well below 4 percent.  So that's something that needs public.  The various lower than 4 percent.

might believe this of household balance sheets or the effects of lingering consequences of shocks, time.  In the parlance using, these are headwinds.  Other factors-such as demographic change, slowing translates into lower productivity gains, or durable changes in more permanent in nature, though, phenomena would presumably need to continue long enough There are lots of reasons, as people have already mentioned, why one to be the case.  Some, such as incomplete repair fiscal consolidation, can be understood as shocks, or as the that will have a restraining effect on growth for a nontrivial but finite we've been technological innovation that preferences manifested in behavior such as saving rates-are for that reason, observation of these to convincingly make the case.

explanation, though, which I think falls somewhere between the reduction in growth potential.  Most, if not all, of us have, over the past There's another persistent but ultimately fading character of headwinds and the enduring character of demographics.  That's several years, marked down potential GDP growth.  The Tealbook has, on several occasions,

March 18-19, 2014

has done so as well.  In some sense, of course, this explanation can draw explanations, both secular changes and persistent but ultimately finite it does capture an important set of expectations on our part.  And I'd note that these in various survey data and spreads that we see in markets. explained why the staff on several other possible factors, but expectations are also reflected around this general proposition, much potential has decreased, I do think a pretty strong case can be for the proposition that we don't need to make the language in paragraph 6 as conditional than assumed on the basis of pre-crisis experience. Precisely because there seems to be such convergence even if we differ as to how made as it now reads.  Indeed, a case could be made that the levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run are themselves lower

in the SEP that six of us have already indicated that we believe the longer-term to be below 4 percent, and I suspect at least a few others on the Committee might come to in the language in right now.  We would obviously need to analyze and discuss this issue mention the case for it mostly to show that the is actually a good deal softer than the position that stated assessments of growth I do note rate that conclusion as well.  To be clear, I'm not arguing for such a change paragraph 6, at least not much more before making such a change.  But I position reflected in the proposed language might be derived from the Committee's own projections and potential.

those who have observed that the current language states the made this point today, and I think in the teleconference meeting.  I've just explained why I think we could currently believe.  But my more that omission of any particular reason allows a certain optionality for the alone justify such guidance, your position is preserved, even I don't disagree with proposition without explaining why-President Plosser President Fisher made it give such an explanation based on what Committee members immediate response is Committee.  If you think headwinds

March 18-19, 2014

are likely to have greater permanence.  While this markets and the public with no indication that recognized the issue and with no sense of where the upward trajectory would end. though someone else may feel that the reasons may not be ideal, it would be far worse to leave the Committee has even of the federal funds rate end by saying I agree with others that Charlie Plosser makes a good point about the as opposed to short-term interest rates.  Thank you, Madam Chair. I will federal funds rate

Thank you, Madam Chair.  With the economy continuing to recover and the outlook little continue today's decision.  Changing our forward guidance on the fed funds rate is the more challenging issue.

preferred providing more, rather than less, clarity in our guidance.  In particular, as I preferred forward guidance that uses an inflation floor, for inflation forecasts can capture many of the factors that are likely to a goal.  And, third, as liftoff draws nearer, the Committee will probably need to with further clarifications of its intentions in order to manage interest rate We face a tradeoff between maximizing clarity and maintaining flexibility in our guidance.  I mentioned in the videoconference, I three reasons.  First, determine liftoff but which are hard to spell out simply in forward guidance.  Second, an inflation floor would refer to the component of our dual mandate for which we have quantitative provide the public expectations.

that a majority of the Committee does not support premium on All of that being said, I recognize including forward guidance with an inflation floor.  Many on the Committee place a

March 18-19, 2014

will warrant liftoff of the fed funds rate and when. that flexibility does have its benefits, and I have argued for flexibility in other maintaining flexibility about which conditions I appreciate situations.

that's laid out in the current alternative B has first draft that we looked at.  So today I do B. The more qualitative forward guidance evolved and has improved considerably since the support alternative operating framework will be, and referring to could create confusion among the public and distract from the main rather than other short-term interest rates.  Thank you, Madam Chair. Like President Plosser and others who have already commented, I do have a strong preference for referring to the federal funds rate in paragraph 6 rather than short-term interest rates.  At this point, it isn't clear what the future short-term interest rates message of the statement today.  And, obviously, the SEP also provides projections for the federal funds rate

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lacker. CHAIR

I do see an less heavy-handed version of paragraph 7.  I think in the intending to provide. MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B, but opportunity for improvement.  First, I like the that, combined with paragraph 5, it does a good job of cementing the notion of continuity forward guidance that we're and Lockhart, though, with serious concerns about the second paragraph 6.  There are two main reasons.  First-and I don't think it's been message today.  This is a new element of forward guidance. continuity and that we don't believe we're changing this meeting.  So I'm concerned about how readers are I join Presidents Plosser sentence in mentioned-this would muddy our Taken by itself, I think it would be viewed as a downward nudge to the yield curve.  But we've strived in paragraphs 5 and 7 to emphasize this net stance of our forward guidance at

March 18-19, 2014

this.  Does paragraph 6 convey new information or not?  Why did we add it emphasizing that our forward guidance is the same? going to interpret now when, in the next paragraph, we're the Committee to really thoroughly survey and understand.  What time period does this refer to?  You the language that says 'mandate-consistent levels.'  You look at the SEP for 2016, and it up near there.  But, on the other hand, paragraph 6 seems to refer to We the longer-run projections.  We haven't defined that as congruent with 'mandate We never said that.  The January 2012 statement explicitly avoids equating the levels.  So we're muddying up that nuance there. Second, more broadly, I think it's ambiguous and treads on ground that has yet look at looks as though it lines something beyond 2016 as well.  It says 'even after' we get to near mandate-consistent levels. I'd point out that, of course, we haven't said what mandate-consistent levels are for 2016. have consistent.' longer-run values with mandate-consistent

appropriate intercept term in a Taylor rule-and some people refer to it as the real rate-might have fallen.  But it was just a stray comment or two at the last the case. have the funds rate in the longer run at 4 percent.  So I don't think trajectory after 2016 is going to look to put in something of this liftoff.  For those two reasons, the statement would be much Now, I know there's been discussion, to which Governor Tarullo has alluded, about the possibility that the equilibrium meeting, and I'm not sure we've really digested the possibility that that's going to be Besides, a whole lot of us still we know enough now, on a sustained basis, about what the like.  I just don't think we've done our homework to be able specificity about the path after the better without the second sentence in paragraph 6.

'short-term interest rates.'  I think this rates, as opposed to the funds rate, level.  But, otherwise, I support alternative B.  Thank you. And I share President Plosser's concern about would be new to speak about our keeping short-term interest at any particular

think we're in good shape for is an time to be introducing such a change.  It's widely anticipated in financial markets risk in terms of market reaction, but, on the other hand, any likely wash out after a few days because the fundamental policy is not really MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Basically, I today.  We're changing the form but not the substance of our forward guidance.  This appropriate and elsewhere because we're approaching the 6½ percent threshold.  This is making that kind of a number largely irrelevant for monetary policy considerations for the future.  Any change, I think, that we make carries potential market reaction will being altered at this meeting.

B for today.  I have two remarks on alternative B and then some to some of the previous comments ahead of me here today.  The first comment is on the into the statement and into the Committee's thinking.  Concerning paragraph 7, this meant to reassure markets that nothing has changed in terms of the level of policy think it's not good practice to include paragraphs in the statement to explain the meaning of changes elsewhere in the statement.  In effect, we're the strength of housing, which is changed in paragraph 1, for some of the more recent data on housing and indicate why we what they might also say in that footnote that this doesn't necessarily mean that the Committee of the most recent housing data. So I support alternative reactions wisdom of paragraph 7, and the second comment is on the wisdom of putting too much time dependence paragraph is accommodation.  In general, I that purport footnoting the statement.  One could imagine footnoting other parts of the statement that contain changes.  You could footnote example, and you might cite changed that part of the statement-because the data are a little bit different from were.  We had changed its policy because we changed slightly our view

March 18-19, 2014

it seems circular and somewhat This kind of tactic strikes me as self-referential, and counterproductive to me.

understand what we're trying to do here, and I may be persuaded just for today, given the somewhat special circumstances-it being the Chair's first meeting may strengthen our hand.  But I think the more appropriate approach up, and, for other changes in the statement, we end to say something about the meaning of it. Having said all of that, I that, and press conference-it would be just to omit paragraph 7 and use the press conference to communicate more fully the meaning of the statement.  That's how this is set wouldn't include a special provision at the going to refer here to the 'considerable waiting period between I do not think that it conveys sufficient state dependence as most market participants and maybe most FOMC participants around this table, it time without too much regard for what happens in the economy.  In Lockhart noted, it might mean six months.  I do not think we can Committee should continually strive to express itself in of calendar-based thinking is that, when the it is time to make a move, the economy may be saying something else, and this in our minds.  We got to that date, and the circumstances weren't right. doing and what it's actually doing. All right.  Let me turn to time dependence.  I'm time' phrase in paragraph 5 of alternative B, which is meant to convey a the end of the asset purchase program and the date of liftoff.  I understand that, in principle, this is a state-contingent object, but written.  For means a fixed amount of many cases, as President change this today, but I do think the state-contingent terms.  One of the main dangers calendar says that Committee has, in several circumstances, run into exactly that kind of problem.  We had a calendar date circled And that creates a mismatch between what policy should be

to this problem, especially with the date of liftoff in 2014, 2015, and a laser-like focus in financial markets.  I agree completely with Vice The SEP contributes 2016, a date that receives

March 18-19, 2014

this needs a revamp.  We have looked at it before. a difficult issue.  I understand that.  I do think that there may be a very simple change that we we're getting closer to the date of liftoff, it might pay to make a special question in 'What quarter date of liftoff?'  And you could plot that separately.  It makes a big really 2014, fourth quarter, that.  But it might be more informative as we get closer if Chairman Dudley's comments yesterday that It's could make in the near term.  As the SEP more granular with respect to the date of liftoff.  You could have the SEP that would ask not just 'What year are you anticipating liftoff?' but also are you anticipating the difference.  I was the one who changed from 2014 to 2015, but it was to 2015, first quarter.  So I moved over a bin in the picture, and, the way this gets reported, somebody will say something about we start talking about the quarter of liftoff currently expected based on the data.

revamp of the SEP.  I would urge all of you to consider a I know we tried to do that earlier.  It didn't work think that maybe the perspective has changed.  We're a little bit closer to normal policy might be the time to, again, renew that issue.  I know we had thoughts about that at on the table, but, eventually, I think the future of report that summarizes, in we're thinking as a group. That would be a very simple change.  It might convey a little bit more.  Longer term, I do think we need a more substantial renewed attempt at a monetary policy report. out, but I now, and it previous meetings, and we probably have plans this Committee is that we're going to have to have a monetary policy some way, the view of the Committee so that markets can absorb what moved up somewhat, I guess I'm should do on that is just cite lower unemployment.  Unemployment has where it was at the time of the December meeting.  So, logically, a few people to adjust slightly the setting they think we're going to have for the simplest and cleanest thing to say.  We don't have to Concerning the 2016 SEP policy rate, which has convinced that what we moved down considerably from that's going to cause the policy rate in 2016.  I think that's

March 18-19, 2014

changing membership or other things like that.  It's true that the growth forecast is cite labor markets and say that that looks to move up slightly. talk about actually going in the wrong direction.  So I would just better than it did, and that it probably caused some people is mind, three explanations for the closed and after there's the headwinds explanation, which, in my mind, means there are some unspecified shocks that are going to hit the economy at this distant date in the these I also think it sends a pessimistic signal about our view of the future of what the explanation. I'm going to react to a few things people have said.  In paragraph 6, the second sentence-'keeping . . . rates below'-I agree with President Plosser that the story behind this not clear.  As I have described it here before, there are, in my low policy rate in 2016, which, again, is occurring after output gaps have inflation has returned to target.  These three explanations, which were touched on by Governor Tarullo here, are as follows:  First, that future.  I think that's a difficult story to tell.  How could we, sitting here today, know what shocks are going to be? the U.S. economy, and it's an unwarranted pessimistic signal.  We don't really know world is going to be like in 2016.  So the headwinds explanation is one possible

It's because we're following made earlier.  I know that that one is not being used, and it's The second is the Woodford explanation, which I here.  The we're making up for the time when we were constrained by the zero bound.  The story, even though it's become less popular here, has a great aspect optimistic story.

on that.  Global real interest rates rate to the 1980s, the 1990s, or the 2000s.  Among the three explanations, this one has, I think, pessimistic tinge to it if you think the real rates are lower because of lower potential growth for the U.S. economy.  If you told a global story, which I think is very plausible-as a global saving glut, let's say, which is rates low-then it would not necessarily have to have a pessimistic signal that global real interest rates have been low for quite a while, that that would persist out into the future, and that that to why the neutral policy rate won't be as high as it has been time closed, I have inflation back at target, I'm not expecting any not putting that much weight on this story of low global real that far out into the future. The third one is that real interest rates are lower and will continue to be lower in 2016 than they have been historically.  I would put a global aspect are lower than they have been historically, and that's why, when you add the real interest the inflation target, you get a somewhat lower neutral policy rate than you would have when you looked at the most potential for the Committee to rally around.  It has a that it as keeping real interest from the U.S. point of view.  It certainly seems to be true uncharacteristically might be an important factor as historically.  My own SEP has us back at a 4 percent or 4¼ percent policy rate by that period because I have output gaps special shocks at that time, and I'm interest rates persisting

I do not think it's why we keep getting a lot of questions about it.  It just raises a lot of in the minds of market participants.  Somehow shocks are going to be hitting the time, or shocks that are still around today are superpersistent, and yet persistent is a very difficult way to go about telling a story.  Why have these shocks not We're often using the headwinds explanation in public comments, but very effective, and that's questions economy at that in a way that's not preventing the output gap from closing and inflation from going back to target.

I want to add to something I said yesterday worried about putting the American people back to work, which is part of is to provide an arbitrage opportunity, an incentive to important that we understand that dynamic.  That's MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Madam and explain why I walked through the stock and bond metrics as I did.  The bottom line is that, for those of us who are our mandate, investment-grade corporate yields have been lower than the S&amp;P's forwardearnings yield.  And what that does corporations to issue bonds and to use the proceeds to buy back shares-not to invest, as yet, robustly in job-creating cap-ex.  I think it's the only reason I go into it in depth.

But, having been there, we have to be extremely tiptoe out of this room as we begin to change and provide forward guidance. I'm quite sympathetic of that particular sector of the financial markets-referring, triple-Cs-you have to remember that the And all of these issues that I mentioned and Governor Stein mentioned and so on-I think the key operative word in his intervention yesterday was 'tiptoe.'  Like him, I was quite the upside-meaning I wasn't careful to easy part, as President Pianalto mentioned, which is the LSAPs.  In fact, I think it's very important that, as we tiptoe out of that room, we not than the measured rate at which we're taking it-even though I respect that later, but, at make the recommendation for now-but just to put it on would not be in favor of going to more than $10 billion per month.

However, I think President Lockhart made the ammunition in case things slip to paragraph, we're taking a good first step.  It may be that, by including that sentence, than we need to take.  I don't know.  In other words, I may want to put that it, because I think President Lockhart made a very good point, which is, it that was your point, President or the various presidents, I do think we need to change the 'keeping In terms of tiptoeing-and remembering that we our holster-as you know, I recommended that we take out and I don't most convincing argument there.

Presently, as we put your imprimatur as Chair of this Committee on the statement, without that we take a step further in my holster and save could help us later on should things slip to the downside.

last point:  I have very strong feelings about shifting from a 2 percent target to percent floor.  I know we're not arguing that at the present juncture, but I expect that to be an as a floor as opposed to a long-term target.  Thank you, Chair. Here's one a 2 interesting argument in the future.  And I want to, again, put on the table that I am strongly against thinking of 2 percent Madam

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota.

Chair.  I see today's FOMC statement as the best way target once the unemployment rate falls thoughtful I have decided to vote am dissenting because the new forward guidance weakens the credibility it fosters in my vote.  I'll briefly elaborate on my dissent. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam a significant one.  Over the past few months, we've had a fulsome discussion about to communicate about the evolution of the fed funds rate below 6.5 percent.  Thanks in part to your leadership, Madam Chair, this has been a and deliberative process, which is culminating today in alternative B.  But against alternative B.  I of the commitment to return inflation to the 2 percent target from below, and because policy uncertainty that hinders economic activity.  I do strongly endorse the language paragraph 6, with the emendation that President Plosser offered.  But my enthusiasm for that paragraph is not sufficient to change tended downward over the past few near 1 percent.  Tealbook A does not see the inflation rate returning to 2 after we publicly committed to 2 percent as our target.  The are being taken to facilitate a more rapid target by suggesting that the Committee views inflation persistently In terms of credibility, the PCE inflation rate has years and is currently percent until 2018.  This is six years FOMC should communicate the purposeful steps that return of inflation to target.  The absence of this kind of communication weakens the credibility of the Committee's inflation below 2 percent as an acceptable outcome.

March 18-19, 2014

uncertainty, most labor market metrics imply that the economy is still well in alternative B, the Committee little information about its desired rate of progress toward maximum employment. guidance provides no quantitative measure of what constitutes maximum extent to which the Committee is as a drag on In terms of short of maximum employment.  In its forward guidance provides Indeed, the employment.  These omissions foster uncertainty about the willing to use monetary stimulus to foster faster growth, and this uncertainty acts economic activity.

threshold of 6.5 percent 2½ percent.  Because of the effectiveness of this approach, I would have favored adopting a similar approach for the future.  To be preferred language would have been as follows:  'The Committee the unemployment rate has the one- to two-year-ahead outlook for PCE inflation remains risks to stability remain well contained.'  This alternative guidance communicates a willingness reduces macroeconomic the kinds of labor market and inflation conditions that are likely increase in the federal funds rate.  Finally, it deals with what I see as the What could we have done instead?  In my view, over the past 15 months, the Committee's forward guidance about the fed funds rate has been highly effective at managing market expectations.  That guidance has relied on an unemployment rate and an inflation outlook guardrail of quantitative even more specific, my anticipates keeping the fed funds rate in its current range at least until fallen below 5.5 percent, as long as below 2¼ percent, longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored, and possible financial to use monetary policy to push inflation back up to 2 percent.  It uncertainty by being clear about to be associated with an unlikely possibility of risks to financial stability through an explicit escape clause.

bit off my script.  A question that occurs to people, I think, is, will Aren't we back to normal now, so can't we just Here, I'm going a little we always need quantitative forward guidance?

March 18-19, 2014

we used during extraordinary times?  And here, I think, the us is that we can't go back to normal-as, say, we were doing in 2004 or 2006we've made a change in what our framework is.  We now have an means we have to communicate making progress toward that goal. get rid of this extraordinary tool that problem for because of the fact that explicit number that operates as our target-2 percent.  That numerically about how we're doing in terms of was planning to ameliorate any gaps between its current on both the employment and inflation dimensions, we wouldn't have to monetary policy report.  Here I'm need to have this in the statement. If we had a monetary policy report that was communicating on a consistent basis about what the Committee's outlook was, depending on its policy, and that described the Committee's plans on an ongoing basis for how it outcomes and the target have all of this in the statement.  It would be, instead, in the fully aware that President Bullard probably disagrees with what I would have in the report, but I think having that kind of communication would eliminate the We're not at that stage.

I do strongly endorse paragraph 6, with the particular interest rates' with 'the target for the federal funds rate.'  I an very long indeed if we try to insist on that.  I providing the public with the information they need about the covariance structure of going to be near is going to remain below historical norms. I'll close by noting again that emendation of replacing 'short-term think this paragraph provides information about the Committee's intentions for the behavior of the fed funds rate once employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels.  From intellectual point of view, I'm sure it's very interesting to try to figure out why we're doing this. That's not something we usually insist on-having agreement among the Committee about why we're doing things.  And these meetings will get think this is the mandate variables and our policy tool:  Employment and inflation are mandate-consistent levels, and the fed funds rate

couple of observations.  One observation is about the second sentence in to say that I agree with a lot of what Dan said here about that the paragraph is written, as opposed to a previous the longer run.' think the our hands behind our back in a particular way because, in other words, run.  Therefore, really, it's very headwindswas, it's not just previous historical because it left that a little bit more open.  I don't think we're going to litigate that one point. I have just a paragraph 6, which I support.  I have keeping an open mind on longer-run secular forces.  In that regard, I wanted to draw attention to a slight difference in the current way formulation.  Now it refers to 'below levels the Committee views as normal in A previous iteration of it said 'below their historical levels for some time.'  I actually current formulation ties it's basically fixing some notion of the longer oriented right now.  I basically thought that a lot of what Governor Tarullo said short-run headwinds.  At least in principle, it's also longer-run, secular forces.  President Bullard alluded to saving, productivity, demographics-all of that stuff.  I like the formulation now, but if we're going to have the conversation that Dan encouraged us to have and which I think we should have, then the historical formulation just leaves that open.  So that's just an observation-is that we've talked a lot about A second observation-and it's qualitative versus quantitative guidance.  Another dimension is, where does the guidance fall on a spectrum, with one end of the spectrum being 'Commitment' and the other end being 'Well,

March 18-19, 2014

my forecast, but don't take it too seriously'?  I think we're in the midst of an to say, the 6.5 percent to a commitment.  Paragraph 5 has, 'it not a commitment, but it has strong elements of commitment.  We could break the I think that, in signing on to the statement, it would be a big deal to do something early 2015. this is kind of important evolution on this dimension of the guidance as well.  That is threshold was a commitment, or it grew to be pretty close likely will be appropriate to maintain . . . for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends'-it's glass, but before there are words market the same kind of definitive certainty as to the dots.  We, I think, struggle to how to interpret them.  I saw something in the That's not what we have in mind, but we learned this in the taper episode. what we're doing, and sometimes people who just something on which there's room for heterogeneity.  I certainly feel this myself.  I feel as commitment-like.  For the 2016 dot, it's just2016 dot.  I don't feel By contrast, paragraph 6 is very different, and it's written artfully, but like 'currently anticipates' and 'may . . . warrant.'  Basically, we're saying, 'Take the 2015 dot really pretty seriously.  Take the 2016 dot as a forecast.'  Now, to be clear, both of these formulations are roughly appropriate, but they imply a potentially tricky transition as time passes.  And we implicitly are not giving the what's coming.  I just wonder how market participants interpret among ourselves as Financial Times yesterday that gave me a little bit of pause.  Somebody wrote, 'Well, the dots are becoming the new thresholds.' Different people make different inferences about are not necessarily the median person are nevertheless influential for market prices.  So I think it's though, when I write down my 2015 dot, it feels whatever.  So I wouldn't have a huge amount of qualms about revising the as though I'm committing.

March 18-19, 2014

a process of weaning market participants off of this, and I don't quite know how think, again, the statement does a very good job.  It's written very well.  And I'm not not suggesting, Madam Chair, that a gradual process, and we've got to might want to take note of some markers along the way and hope that this through time.  As we move away from giving commitment and we move toward just anything to do about it now.  Thank you. There's we do it.  I suggesting that we go out and beat them over the head.  I'm you go out and say, 'Look, 2016 is really an estimate.'  It's evolve there.  We sinks in over time.  In my ideal world, if we're looking at market volatility, it ought to be rising as we move giving more traditional guidance, I would hope that, in some controlled sense, volatility would be going up.  That would be a healthy thing.  Beyond that, I don't really think there's prescriptive

way, I expressed a fair asset purchase program what I saw as the lack of a stopping rule that covered most of the reasonably likely didn't happen.  Instead, the Committee is going today for the third consecutive meeting.  On net, the market has barely market participants seem comfortable with the path.  This is a big win, and it's a in, is As Stan Fischer suggested five days ago in our confirmation hearing, the process of returning monetary policy to a normal stance has now begun.  Along the amount of concern that the Committee could lose control of the current because of outcomes, and I'm very pleased to note that that to reduce purchases reacted, and very good start for the normalization process.  But, having been cautious about getting this far I'm going to suggest the need for caution on the way out because the process of normalization

market, of course, is supposed to react to good and bad economic news, and, if the Committee against it is to tie down forward guidance, and I support the last sentence in paragraph 6.  I'll come to some others me, the idea is to build a framework that will be resilient to the kind of events in to see us tie down guidance. other hand, we need to be very careful not to Now, the that's the source of the surprise and the source of the reaction, then it's one that can and must manage.  I think the way to protect that's one of the reasons later.  But, to which the economy strengthens, and so in the period ahead I'd like It's not going to be perfect, as I'll get to.  On the send a signal that our reaction function has changed.  A tightening that's not based on stronger economic news could stop and reverse progress.  We could find ourselves having to gear up asset purchases again, and that is not a place that I aspire to be.

And, unfortunately, it's one that the Committee is not very through monetary policy, a famously blunt instrument. perhaps well equipped to handle except would call them mixed but trending toward really think that the level of the equity markets is a function cyclically adjusted P/E, and valuation-to-sales.

And we Let me say what I think those two risks will obviously involve rates moving up and volatility returning to normal levels as the economy improves.  The process is almost guaranteed to be bumpy and jagged and not smooth, and we need to volatility that come with a stronger economy should be welcomed.

fact that longer-term rates in the SEP are all at true on its face.  I also think the analysis that Governor Tarullo it as written. In closing, let me say a couple of things about the statement.  I like paragraph 6 for a bunch of reasons.  First, I guess I'd start with the 4 and 4¼, so the Committee has, in fact, projected its impression of long-term rates.  But 13 of the 16 participants have rates more than 100 basis points below that in 2016.  So I think the second sentence of paragraph 6 is and many others have gone through is pretty persuasive.  So I'm comfortable with I'm happy to have 'short-term interest rates' changed to 'the federal funds rate.'

is, I of a perception in the market that this these points, maybe even than you otherwise would, and then lean into that.  Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm going to take some risk with this, but I'm going to go ahead and say it, and that think a dovish dissent at this meeting does increase the risk is a hawkish surprise.  Therefore, it's on the Chair even more to hit harder

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman. CHAIR

DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Well, I support alternative B. it's important to revamp the statement before the unemployment rate reaches the threshold in today's VICE CHAIRMAN I think 6½ percent threshold, for several reasons.  First of all, it allows us to preempt the question of what happens when the threshold is actually reached.  If we kept the

March 18-19, 2014

sorts of questions about the subsequent meeting, and we might not have the press conference think, makes a lot of just takes it off the table. statement and then the unemployment rate declined, that would raise all what would happen at scheduled as a vehicle to explain ourselves.  So, doing it preemptively, I sense because it unemployment rate threshold adds much value the SEP numbers or you look at the market expectations, everyone we're going to wait long past the time when the unemployment rate gets below So it's not as though there's a lot of information content in that.  I recognize that the question of whether that threshold still applies in terms of our Second, I don't think the 6½ percent currently.  If you look at thinks that 6½ percent. removing it does create behavior, but I think that's taken care of by paragraph 7.

essential to add the language in both sentences of paragraph 6.  Financial just by the timing of liftoff, but also by the trajectory second sentence in paragraph 6, conditions.  If you don't provide that risk premiums, which go I also think it's conditions are determined in large part not of short-term interest rates after that.  So if you omitted the you're basically not telling people what you think is likely to happen after liftoff, and that's a very important component of what drives financial guidance, that implies greater uncertainty, greater volatility, and higher against what we're trying to accomplish.

is expectations may not be realized.  So there's still plenty of that outlook, but we thinking about what current thinking, recognizing that what we think and That said, I think it's very important not to oversell paragraph 6, and my view here very close to Governor Stein's.  Our residual uncertainty about the outlook.  We can't eliminate the underlying uncertainty about the economic outlook and the path of short-term rates that's consistent with certainly can eliminate that portion of uncertainty about our own current we're expecting to do.  We should share our

There's not much pre-commitment how this will translate into our actions will evolve over time. here at all, in my opinion.

into the statement at an early enough stage that it's not going to be taken as a signal of didn't do it today, taking advantage of Chair Yellen's first meeting as percent on the unemployment rate, easily, especially with paragraph 7 emphasizing revamp of the statement does not change the guidance.  The problem is not the statement. I also think adding paragraph 6 today has the benefit of getting the post-liftoff forward guidance impending liftoff.  If we the head of the Committee and the fact that we're close to 6½ then we'd have these questions of when we would add it and how the market would take it as a signal at that time.  Looking at the statement, I think that, if we didn't have the SEP problem, the markets could actually digest paragraph 6 quite that a The problem is the SEP dots in 2016.

the substance of paragraph 6-that the neutral level of interest rates is likely the historical average for some time?  That can be justified in many ways.  First, if were really close to the historical average of 2 percent, then I would lot more rapidly than we actually have been growing, given that the is minus 1 percent.  Second, on the headwinds side, it's probably What exactly are these headwinds?  I see two On the investment side, I see lots of reasons why investment is weakhave much equity in their houses or are even underwater on mortgages, they can't refinance, and they can't move. mortgage market, you see sharp differentiation on the availability of mortgage credit are What about to be below the equilibrium real rate think we'd be growing a current real interest rate important for us to talk a little bit more about this. broad sets of headwinds. for example, homeowners who don't their mortgages, so they can't get new Also, in the based on FICO scores, which is very different than what's applied historically.  I think there still constraints on credit to small business start-ups.  So a whole bunch of things are constraining

On the saving side, there are lots of reasons to think that caused a shift in the saving function to greater precautionary saving.  When I started to think of it conceptually, I thought of it as, the investment and more saving, and so that's period of time.  It would be good for us to try to articulate thing I want to talk about a little bit is something that hasn't been discussed.  I effect of monetary policy on economic activity depends on both the level of rates and the change in the level of interest rates, and I don't think we've had any We saw over the last year what the effects of the increase in mortgage market-we saw a pretty significant slowing in the housing market.  I is, as interest rates rise, how much of a in financial conditions exert on the economy, even if we're still at an is something that, when I worked in the private really struggled with.  Is it the level of financial conditions, or is it the change of I'd like to see more work done on a little bit.  It's relevant now because we're just so far away that we think is going to apply over the longer term.  Normally, to end up, it could actually be quite important. The third really do think the interest discussion about that. rates were on the housing would encourage the staff to look at this question-that restraint will that change accommodative monetary policy setting?  This sector, we financial conditions, that actually affects economic growth? this so we could understand that from the equilibrium real rate you're in the vicinity, and so this distinction doesn't really matter very much.  But when you're really far away from where you want

Frankly, it would still be nice to get a little bit more balance sheet.  I still think there are two issues there.  The the timing of when the reinvestment process ends.  Simon talked yesterday about how What's missing from the statement? guidance about the trajectory of our first is there was quite a broad range of views about when reinvestment is going to end.  Most people

think it's close to the time of liftoff, but the fact that there's still that uncertaintyI'd like to be a little bit clearer about not selling agency MBS.  I think that's what the to just nail that down a little bit more.  What's over time is also important as a factor conditions.  So providing greater clarity about that would be good. probably that's something that we could clarify and eliminate.  So I'd like to take care of that.  The second thing is, market expectation is, but it would be nice happening to the trajectory of the balance sheet influencing financial a lot of work, and we have a particular problem to the Chair: assumptions embedded in it.  I would the driving thing in trying to the SEP.  But I do expect that the market will react a little bit negatively to what's in the note the tension between the statement and the SEP. I'm still unhappy about the SEP.  I think we remain overly reliant on it to communicate our forecast expectations.  It's flawed.  It needs today in that the statement signals no change in guidance, but the SEP for 2016 shows an increase of 50 basis points.  And that's going to be really hard for the Chair to reconcile.  So I, not being the person presiding over the press conference, would offer this advice We need to emphasize the statement because the statement is the action of the Committee, while the SEP is just a collection of forecasts with different emphasize that we should just keep coming back to the statement as discuss SEP, and that they will

the change in paragraph 5 in terms of the second doing very much, so I guess I feel as though, if you make the change, people are going to wonder what the change means.  I just don't feel as that change. Regarding language, I don't see 'current' as going to note the change and they're though you've quite gotten over the threshold to motivate paragraph 6, on 'short-term interest rates,' my personal view is that 'shortmeans it includes a lot of different things and where we're going to go.  If we go to 'the federal funds In terms of term interest rates' is a big tent, and that big tent gives us complete optionality about

issue about the second sentence in I think this is a point that to Governor Tarullo's point, too.  So I want to emphasize that the language in the 'warrant keeping short-term interest rates below levels the I think the only way you can interpret this is, not really about the long-run table, including Governor long run more than the difference between 2016 and the long run. estimates of the long run. MR. WILLIAMS.  I want to go back to this paragraph 6.  In describing it, the Vice Chairman did mention, actually, the earlier language, which referred to historical averages.  It doesn't currently say that, and relates statement, which I do support, says Committee views as normal in the longer run.' looking at the 2016 numbers versus the long-run numbers.  It's numbers.  A number of the arguments that have been discussed at the Tarullo's, probably affect the Demographic factors, productivity growth-those are all going to show up, presumably, in people's careful in talking about It is talking about the fact that we expect real interest rates to end of 2016, even though we think that, in the long run, real interest I wanted to bring that up because I think there is maybe a mixing up two ideas here in terms of what the statement's actually referring to. I'm bringing this up because I think you have to be a little bit what this sentence actually says. essentially be zero at the rates are between 1½ and 2 percent. little bit of

DUDLEY.  I think you're right.  There are two ideas here.  One is there are these temporary factors that may last a long time because of this extended crisis VICE CHAIRMAN that

And then there are more persistent factors-demographics, potential GDP growth-that are going to last for a very, very long time, as they're pretty much baked in the cake.  Those are two separate- language refers only to the difference between 'for some run.'  I'm just bringing that up. MR. WILLIAMS.  Right.  In our previous language, the one you referred to actually covered both of those.  The current time' and 'the longer

YELLEN.  That was part of the reason for getting rid of that language, as we it is consistent with what you see in the SEP, it's appropriate, writing down our views is normal in the longer run if demographics and productivity growth end up being more in the direction of headwinds as what this is about. CHAIR would immediately be asked 'What period?  What historical average?'  It's very different over different periods.  If we leave the language as is, and it doesn't prevent us from, over time, if we decide as to what important.  But I think it does point into agree that this is something we ought to do today.  While I not at 6½ percent-and, as President Evans indicated, one could make the case know that what we have here is as revised forward guidance, but it really does bridge a lot of different views on the Okay.  Well, thanks.  I appreciate all of the effort and thought that all of you have put this.  This is not an easy transition.  I understand we're for waiting-I think it's broadly expected.  And the fact that we are approaching 6½ percent, to me, seems like a compelling reason to move forward today.  I not perfect Committee.

If I count numbers, since almost all of you weighed in on this, I

would say to weigh in in favor of keeping it in, for the that many of you have explained, especially since we have the dot plot.  If we don't this as a Committee, the dot plot will basically be what the world has to interpret our in the the SEP was ever meant to be a statement of this Committee's policy the meeting before last-looking at alternative low rates for a time, even after the economy is back at mandatewould say the 'keep it in' camp outnumbers slightly the 'take it out' camp.  And I that my own personal preference is, I would like reasons speak to views on this.  I'd prefer it if the Committee, when it has a view, articulates that view statement.  I don't think views.  And, while I agree, I think we have had some analysis of this issue.  The staff prepared a very thoughtful memo-I believe that it was for reasons why we are projecting consistent levels.

We believe that inflation feel some sense of confidence that the labor precisely what the reasons are. it expressed in the Clearly, it is something.  It doesn't have the same status as the which, I agree, were more like commitments.  This is a forecast, and I think it's stated to stick with paragraph 6 and We include quite a few statements about our collective beliefs. is going to be heading back up to 2 percent.

So, with your permission, I would like ask us to vote on that.

there anybody who would be opposed to doing I did hear a considerable amount of interest in changing it.  Anybody who would haveWith respect to wording, I heard a great deal of support in paragraph 6 to change 'shortterm interest rates' to 'the federal funds rate.'  Is that? yes.

'The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.'

PARTICIPANT.  Yes.

YELLEN.  Then I think the only other open issue here in terms of wording was heard a couple of no's.  Are there other people stick with the original language:  'The Committee anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate funds rate,' et cetera.
