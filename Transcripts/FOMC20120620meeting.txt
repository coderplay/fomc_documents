19-20, 2012 Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on June

19 Session June

here in the The last time there were seven Board members at an FOMC am told, was March 2005.  There has been a short hiatus since that time.  We welcome with them and learning I am optimistic because I note that they both got their B.A.'s from Princeton That is a good start.  Welcome, and we look forward to working with CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good morning.  I would like to start by welcoming two new members to the table, Governor Jeremy Stein and Governor Jay Powell, sitting over delinquents' corner.  [Laughter] meeting, I our two new distinguished colleagues and look forward to collaborating from them. University.  [Laughter] you.

It's a a person of such policy experience, but Brian got his Ph.D. in Clinton's youthful appearance and his energy, We also have a departure of which to take note.  This is Brian Sack's last meeting.  Brian has served as the manager of the System Open Market Account has attended 25 issues, both inside and outside the Fed, as the head of the Monetary Analysis Section of the little hard to believe for second term [laughter], which accounts at least a bit for his notwithstanding the maturity of his contributions.

been a terrific leader and manager of the financial operations during a very difficult and complex time, and we are grateful for all you've done, for your dedication and your service.  And I would like to for a moment to the Vice Chairman to add a couple of comments. Brian, you have been a superb colleague, you've Federal Reserve's extremely turn the floor over

manager.  It probably feels like dog years rather years.  [Laughter]  The balance sheet hasn't changed very much in terms of size on watch, but the composition certainly has.  The Desk has been extraordinarily busy LSAP program of agency MBS and Treasuries, the second LSAP program, got a little bit more attention than the first maturity extension program, and, of The fact that all of the MBS operations been an with intelligence, knowledge, the ability to relate monetary policy and macro to see the forest for the trees.  He has also managed the Markets the Markets Group broadened considerably as the financial System has increased. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you.  I think Brian has had an extraordinary three years as head of the Markets Group and SOMA than people your completing the first which probably course, the reinvestment of maturing MBS securities. were brought in-house under Brian's watch is also very important.  Moreover, Brian has exemplary leader, to markets, and the ability Group effectively.  It has expanded from 230 people when I was the head of to about 400 people today, and its functions have stability mandate of the not only through his briefings and ability to answer all our questions but also in of the Markets Group, in terms of the daily He has been a very able adviser to me and to Governor Yellen.  He speaks his mind, good points, and has very definitely improved my own thinking.  He has kept me out good news is that the Markets Logan, sitting next to him, is a very senior I think you all would agree with me that he has been a terrific resource for the Committee, terms of the quality of product that is coming out briefings, and the MarketSOURCE material, which has really been upgraded significantly under his watch. makes very of trouble on numerous occasions.  He has just been a joy for me personally to work with, and I am going to miss him not being in this role any longer.  But the Group, under his stewardship, is quite deep.  Lorie person in Markets, as is Kevin Stiroh.  And with the new head of the Markets Group, they will

No one can replace Brian, but someone can succeed him. the proposal to appoint Simon Potter as manager of the System Open Market bit about the selection process that produced Simon's name. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Our first item is Account.  And accompanying that, because Simon is currently an associate economist of the FOMC, the item also proposes that we appoint Jamie McAndrews to replace Simon in that role. Both appointments would be effective June 30 and would hold until the selection of successors at the first regularly scheduled organizational meeting next January.  I would like to turn to the Vice Chairman to talk a obviously take whom we have at the ran a and thorough process to identify a successor.  We hired Spencer Stuart as a search our own knowledge are the SOMA manager and head of the Markets Group-macroeconomic monetary Fed, demonstrated management all five of those attributes.  [Laughter]  But we think having a half of them is about as good as you can do, and I would apply that grade to myself you are not going to be VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you.  We head of the Markets Group and as the SOMA manager extraordinarily seriously, and we very complete firm, and they identified a large number of candidates that we augmented by and contacts throughout the markets business.  We identified five criteria that we think important for policy knowledge, knowledge of markets, knowledge of the ability, and demonstrated operations experience.  Now, it turns out that as far as we can tell, nobody in the world actually has three and and to Brian when we took on that job.  It is the kind of position where expert in all things when you start, but the Markets Group is really deep and able, and they have shown their ability to nurture the past two heads of Markets in a very successful way.

candidates at going through the process of extensive a large number of people in New York and close consultation with the Chairman a very strong consensus that Simon Potter was the right person Research over the past years and been an associate economist for this Committee.  But it is important to when the Markets position came open he was strongly did last year, which I think was really and demonstrates his management acumen, was to serve as the point person for Financial Stability Oversight Council's first Annual Report, which was an challenging assignment because, one, it had never been done before, and, two, that all had different views.  That was a pretty I am very confident We went through the search process, and we identified a number of strong both within the New York Fed, elsewhere in the Federal Reserve System, and outside working a variety of different private-sector firms.  And after interviewing by and Governor Yellen, there was for the job.  As the Chairman noted, Simon has been the co-head of couple of underscore the fact that Simon is not just a macroeconomist and monetary policy person.  He has really broadened his knowledge quite a bit beyond macroeconomics.  He did spend a stint in Markets, and he took to it because interested in the position.  The other thing that he noteworthy writing the extraordinarily you're herding cats from all the different agencies stern test, and Simon passed it with flying colors, which really demonstrates his management acumen.  Obviously, these are big shoes to fill with Brian's departure, but that he will be able to do so very ably.

Vice Chairman? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Are there questions for the President Fisher.

I just wanted to thank the Vice Chairman for that Brian knows, a much more complex business than Markets going back to Paul Volcker and up to MR. FISHER.  It is not a question, but thorough description.  This has become, as ever before.  I think I have known every head of

June 19-20, 2012

you, Brian, and your brilliant performance.  In a way, you are the whale.  [Laughter]  And we don't want to have whale repetition occur, so, for the record, I wanted to thank the Vice Chairman for filling us in, and wish Simon good luck.

If not, could I associate FOMC economist? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Other questions?  [No response] have a motion to appoint Simon Potter to manage the System Open Market Account, and to appoint Jamie McAndrews to replace Simon as

When the Committee adopted its external communications policies last June, we noted that some further Federal Reserve System staff might be appropriate.  The Chairman tuning process.  And since then, the directors of the economics divisions at the Board and the research directors at the Reserve Banks have engaged in a series of consultations, identified a number of specific adjustments that would be helpful in clarifying certain aspects of the policy.  For example, the preamble would now include a sentence underscoring the benefits of economic research, and the principles and practical examples would now specifically encompass staff contacts institutions.  I won't strikeouts in the document that was propose this set of amendments for adoption by the Committee, and I would be happy to answer any questions that

However, we an FOMC consensus forecast and a quarterly I will refer to as the QMPR.  We have consulted with all of you general discussion, I would like to take a few minutes to highlight some key issues of pursuing such an approach.  I will then set specific recommendations about an initial experimental exercise that further with this initiative. MS. YELLEN. 2   Thank you, again, Mr. Chairman.  At the April FOMC meeting, you encouraged the subcommittee on communications to consider various approaches for enhancing the Committee's monetary a number of ultimately concluded that it would be preferable to explore the possibility of a more substantial improvement-namely, the development of monetary policy report, which individually, and we very much appreciate the feedback that we have received.  We found enough interest in this approach to put it on today's agenda for further discussion.  Before opening up a regarding the potential desirability and feasibility forth my subcommittee's could be helpful in deciding whether to proceed any

June 19-20, 2012

I want to emphasize my personal view that the SEP is an effective means of assessments of the Its usefulness has been enhanced by the this year.  Of course, it is not always comfortable when the distribution with the phrasing of the FOMC statement. I view that as a feature, not a bug.  I have always felt that public confidence in the FOMC At the outset, communicating to the public about the diversity of participants' individual economic outlook and appropriate monetary policy. inclusion in 2009 of our longer-run projections and the federal funds rate projections that we started publishing earlier of our individual assessments doesn't line up neatly But rests partly on the assurance that our decisions are informed by a true diversity of perspectives, and the SEP provides compelling evidence that we haven't been subsumed into some sort of mind-meld.

growth, unemployment, and inflation-whereas the monetary policy reports of fan charts and alternative scenarios to convey the broader risk to that outlook.  Of course, we faced amounts of time on preparing our SEP submissions.  A more effective in conveying the rationale for the Committee's collective Nonetheless, the design of the SEP does impose some crucial limitations on our external communications.  For example, the SEP focuses on the outlook for a handful of top-line macro variables-GDP many other central banks provide a more thorough description of the current outlook, including the components of aggregate demand, financial and external developments, and so forth. Moreover, the SEP exhibits tend to focus the public's attention on the modal outlook, whereas many other central banks routinely use contours of the outlook and to illustrate salient sources of could consider expanding the SEP survey to elicit such information, but we might well be with spending inordinate fundamental limitation of the SEP is that it is simply a survey of individual views and, hence, it is not necessarily very decisions.

June 19-20, 2012

arrive at our policy judgments through a consensuscan't be well captured by any mechanical procedure for aggregating and might well cause the public to focus on the views of specific participants a Committee.  Consequently, after consultations with forward is to developing a consensus forecast and QMPR.  We believe that such an FOMC communications by providing a coherent rationale participants' individual views.  In discontinued. Under the Chairman's leadership, we building process that truly our individual assessments.  While we could try to address the shortcomings of the SEP by coloring the dots, or identifying participants' projections by name, that sort of approach could harm collegiality rather than on our collective judgments as the Chairman, our subcommittee has concluded that the most promising way explore the possibility of approach could significantly enhance for the Committee's decisions, along with the diversity of effect, the QMPR could serve as the successor to the SEP, which would be you may recall that I have previously expressed strong reservations about I continue to believe that it would be utterly infeasible to replicate approach followed by some other central banks, where a much smaller engages in multiple all of the Reserve Bank presidents were willing to spend a couple of weeks consensus forecast.  And on many occasions I am afraid we still consensus forecast using roughly the same approach that we follow in crafting our Now, some of the feasibility of producing an FOMC consensus forecast.  Given the size and geographical dispersion of the Committee, the intensive forecasting and centrally located policy board refers to a single forecasting model and days of discussions to settle on all the specific details of the outlook.  Such an approach would be conceivable only if here in DC in advance of each might not be able to reach a complete consensus.  In contrast, I do think it might be feasible to produce a postmeeting statements.  Specifically, the Chairman could develop the consensus forecast in consultation with the Committee, circulate an initial draft, and make adjustments in light of

June 19-20, 2012

In our policy go-rounds, we typically engage in line-by-line editing, wordsmithing, and that with a consensus forecast that involves quantitative projections and accompanying narrative. participants' comments, and then present the revised forecast for discussion at the FOMC meeting. fine-tuning of our postmeeting statement language.  In contrast, I think it would be completely impractical to do confidence intervals along with multiple pages of clear that a consensus forecast would only be feasible if for the consensus forecast and accompanying narrative.  At the FOMC meeting, of these views would be reported in the minutes and in the QMPR.  As a governance, such an approach seems reasonable if we agree that the Committee's for those for his remarks.  The diversity of views is then communicated through the minutes speeches and media interviews. To me, therefore, it seems fairly the Chairman confers with the Committee in developing each forecast but has ultimate responsibility participants could endorse the forecast, perhaps with some specific reservations, or could indicate that they hold essentially different views about the economic outlook and appropriate policy, and the diversity matter of policy decisions will continue to be conveyed through our postmeeting statements and, hence, that the consensus forecast and QMPR will simply be aimed at elucidating the rationale decisions.  In effect, the consensus forecast would be roughly similar to the Chairman's press conferences, where he tries to express the sense of the Committee but maintains ultimate responsibility as well as participants'

we also recognize that its prospects for success Therefore, it seems sensible to and systematically while holding off on making any final To summarize, our subcommittee has concluded that developing a consensus forecast and QMPR would be both desirable and feasible, but are contingent on a host of substantive and logistical details. explore this initiative carefully determination about whether to proceed with a public launch until after it has been thoroughly

June 19-20, 2012

could draft a circulate it to the Committee a week before the meeting, make economic go-round.  If that experience suggests that this initiative is vetted through an extensive and extended sequence of proofs of concept, trial runs, and mockups. In keeping with this approach, we think that a useful initial step would be to conduct an experimental exercise in conjunction with the July FOMC meeting.  The Chairman consensus forecast and adjustments, and circulate a revised draft, and then present the consensus forecast for discussion at the conclusion of the completely unworkable, we could simply agree to abandon it at that stage.  Alternatively, if the results of this experiment are sufficiently promising, we could decide to repeat it or perhaps move on to a more elaborate proof of concept exercise in September.

that we are eager to hear your views today on whether you you are comfortable with the general approach, and you would like to proceed with an initial experiment in July. Let me stop there and say think this initiative is worthwhile, whether whether your hard work.  Let me a standard approach around the world for we should consider.  The problem we have, of course, is with a very geographically dispersed Committee, it is much more difficult to develop a consensus key issue as we think about this. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, Janet, once again for express my support for this approach.  Consensus forecasts and supporting documentation, like an inflation report or monetary policy report, are central banks to communicate the rationale for their decisions.  And in that respect, it is a welltested approach, and one large and forecast.  And so the feasibility of that will be the

I think if we have a forecast, it does have to incorporate In particular, if there are any developments right before the meeting, we should be I have some criteria for success. Committee consensus-it can't be solely mine, for example-and it must be consistent with the policy decision.  We need to have a flexible process, so that we can respond to events close to the meeting.

June 19-20, 2012

forecast should have a means of expositing differing views.  It should be a a more complete explanation of our outlook and policies, and, importantly-and this I think we will need to address-it should not be a significant net additional burden on That would be a very important consideration.  What Governor Yellen's subcommittee at each everybody is comfortable or that we have incorporated everybody's views. able to respond.  The vehicle for is an issue the staff. has proposed is an experiment, one in which we would go very slowly, to make sure that stage an experimental consensus forecast this I would do is add one slight additional round.  About two weeks before the Tealbook are at could do, if we decide to go ahead with this, is circulate that forecast and ask your reactions.  Your reaction might be 'This looks okay,' or it might be that 'I disagree with could be simply a qualitative comment, or it could be a I would take those comments, and then proceeding along the lines that week before the meeting I would, working with staff, develop a I would circulate.  I'd get another round of comments, and then, Friday candidate for the final consensus forecast.

want to thank the subcommittee for their hard work on fostering what is really important.  I think it's always and our policy objectives. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I on communications important for this Committee, but it is critical-especially at the current juncture-that we have ways to communicate effectively about our policy

I want to start mean when I say this?  The FOMC statement of policy variables-the fed funds rate-over years.  That is voted on by the Committee, and it is explicitly a forecast a good starting point, but I don't think this enough, though.  I am very enthusiastic to hear from Governor Yellen a consensus forecast about economic conditions. Before answering the questions that were circulated by the Committee, with some observations.  When I think about this issue, my starting point is that the FOMC already does produce a consensus forecast, a consensus forecast that is voted on and, hence, owned by the Committee as a whole.  What do I currently contains an explicit forecast of the path the next two and a half of what is going to happen with policy.  That is forecast of policy is really that she shares my interest in this and that the Committee shares my interest in this.  I think the FOMC needs to produce am going to back off of my prepared text just to be clear what I have in mind when I say a little different from what Governor Yellen was in mind that it is something pretty close to my SEP submissions, which for the unemployment rate at the end of 2012, at the end of 2013, at the end well; a number for inflation at the end of 2012, 2013, 2014, for core as well; and possibly a number for real GDP I 'consensus forecast' because it sounds describing.  I really have would be a number of 2014, possibly the longer run as and the longer run; maybe a number

June 19-20, 2012

something like16 numbers.  That is very similar to what the statement right now. growth.  That is basically a table of Riksbank includes in its am I enthusiastic about a consensus forecast?  It is very important for us to be clear that we are not offering this forecast because we have some special ability or consensus forecast would be valuable to the appropriate policy.  As a mandate evolves with economic conditions. Why with the public information that allows us to see the future better than all of the myriad of private-sector forecasts that are out there.  The main reason a public is that it is conditional on what the Committee believes to be result, our consensus forecast is really a policy tool that allows the Committee to communicate on an ongoing basis about what economic outcomes it is trying to achieve through its choices.  I think such a tool is especially valuable to this organization relative to other central banks because of our dual mandate and the way the employment

a consensus forecast of unemployment and my 16 numbers-we should have something like that that is released you the desired criteria-the desiderata-very well, Mr. Chairman.  It is very important that an iterative process that ensures consistency between the forecast of economic variables current proposal that is at times about how this iteration process would I think that process is very important.  Where I guess I differ a little bit from the is that the consensus forecast of policy variables would be voted on by economic variables, conditional on appropriate To me, these observations suggest four conclusions.  We should continue to have forecast of medium-term policy that is either part of or at least contemporaneous with the statement, as we are doing right now.  We need a inflation.  I talked about contemporaneously with the statement.  The Chairman just spoke about this, and I thought laid out we have and the forecast of policy that is being offered in the statement.  The offered by the subcommittee seems a little vague work, but subcommittee's proposal the full Committee.  The consensus forecast of

June 19-20, 2012

component of policy because it is telling the public what we are trying to achieve Committee.  I would monetary policy report, but I agree with the Chairman that is something policy, is also a with our policy tools.  I think it, too, should be voted on and owned by the love to see a quarterly that can be deferred to later.  That is my initial observation.

guessed my answers to them already. FOMC consensus forecast seems essential to me in our current circumstances.  We should be and careful about what that looks like and how we go about doing it, but I think it is critical thing.  As I have indicated, FOMC.  I have in mind a table of 16 numbers that as challenging as we make it sound.  We are able to agree on and vote on. Let me turn to the questions.  You probably have An deliberate something we need.  The ownership of this forecast is a really a forecast of this kind is inextricably intertwined with the policy choices of the FOMC, and it does need to be voted on and owned by the would have to be voted on.  I don't think it is really issue statements with hundreds of words that we a consensus forecast.  I construct a consensus forecast of policy variables in the meeting, and we I liked what the Chairman was describing I would offer is that it is critical that we have that ensure the consistency of what the Committee is voting on in terms of There are probably ways to work with the process that was suggested subcommittee.  I suggested an alternative before-and I continue to like this-that two meeting, participants submit their projections, just as we do now, for and a mutually consistent forecast of economic variables.  We do that now for I am saying two weeks ahead instead of maybe a Governor Yellen laid out some of the challenges in constructing think that we are able to get that by starting off with what the staff suggests.  So as a potential process.  The only nuance process somehow policy-that is, whatever the forecast of policy variables is-and the eventual forecast of the 16 numbers that comes out. by the weeks before the FOMC appropriate policy the Summary of Economic Projections, except

June 19-20, 2012

So you have tables that go along with each of the We've already got one set of numbers in each statement implicitly because we've would become part of Tealbook B.  And then, we would discuss these I don't have in mind trying to discuss At the end of the day, the members will be voting on the statement, forecast of both economic and policy variables.  What I see is that the week or formulate a table variables in statements. got the policy variables in them.  These can be circulated as part of the draft alternative statements and eventually various alternatives, including the associated forecasts. confidence intervals in this context, but just the numbers of the modal forecast.  We will be engaging in some numbersmithing, just as we do wordsmithing right now, but it ends up being a manageable process. including this consensus eventual output will closely resemble the Riksbank's postmeeting press release.

would be very enthusiastic about running an experiment in July with the Chairman's experimenting with not just one process, but getting the best possible could be sequentially instead.  I have in mind, I suggested as well. I caveats, but it might be a good idea to consider maybe running one or two at the same time to try to make sure we are process.  It doesn't have to be simultaneously-it obviously, the process will just echo what the Chairman said in his remarks, that this decision is going to be a I will caution the Committee and the participants on is that I think comfortable with the current Chairman.  I will speak for myself-I have a great congruent with his particular talents and skills because there will be, at some point in the processes that we I long-lasting one.  One thing we all feel very deal of admiration and respect for him.  But we have to be careful not to set up processes that we know are the future, another person who will hold that job.  We want to be sure that

are also congruent with whoever might hold that position.  Thank you, Mr. set up today Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard.

you, Mr. Chairman.  I'd like to thank the communications really you know, and as I have stressed at previous meetings, I other central banks worldwide.  We have, in can learn a lot from the experience of the other central banks in this arena. found the staff memos on this subject extremely helpful. MR. BULLARD.  Thank subcommittee for all of their work on this, and Governor Yellen, in particular, who has spearheaded this effort.  As many of believe that the next logical step in FOMC communications is, in fact, to develop a quarterly monetary policy report similar to those produced by my view, lagged behind other central banks in this dimension.  I think it is time to catch up.  In addition, I believe we I

advantage of a QMPR is that it can provide improved U.S. economy can take place.  To me what financial markets and other of the economic outlook up to and including special factors ranging disasters to anomalies in financial market data.  A QMPR modeled on central banks could provide such a comprehensive discussion.  This forecasts of a limited set of with only sparse background or context.  I agree with the communications are a host of detailed issues that would have to be ironed out before the helpful to I view the current version of the SEP as somewhat cumbersome In my view, the primary communication by laying down a benchmark from which a robust discussion of monetary policy and the state of the observers desire from the FOMC is a baseline view combined with a complete and full discussion of all aspects from the effects of natural those produced by other would be an improvement on the SEP, which provides many variables subcommittee that there Committee can realistically move forward on this issue.  For this reason it is probably move slowly and deliberately.

June 19-20, 2012

this reason I think the SEP should be eliminated in a QMPR.  The diversity of views on the Committee can be quarterly reports from other central If they are realistic, the uncertainty bands are quite wide, much wider than even My view is that most or all of the participants as a communications tool for the Committee.

In contrast to that helpful to have actual votes on the aspect of the feel compelled to vote against a particular QMPR on all do I suggest that we say that the QMPR is the 'Chairman's summary' the duty of the Chairman, and any future the QMPR represents fair and accurate insight into the thinking of the I think a Chairman that got a long way away from his Committee would face a lot Let me now turn to the question of the ownership of the consensus forecast.  I think it may work best if the Chairman is primarily responsible for the QMPR.  Again, I see the a baseline from which interested parties can debate the issues of the day. have our Adam Posens and our Andrew Sentances-our hawks and doves-and that debate be eternal, but this will provide a benchmark from which that debate President Kocherlakota, I do not think it would be QMPR, especially if the votes were portrayed as a complete endorsement of every forecast.  In that case, future members may the grounds that some aspect of the forecast is quite different from their own view, and we have our own views.  Instead, of the views of the Committee.  I would see it as Chairman, to ensure that Committee. of problems.

also think that we have a process already in place that could be used to develop the I document.  The process is the one that we use to produce the minutes of the meeting.  In that

June 19-20, 2012

chance to comment on the that the minutes good summary of the meeting, not that you agree with everything everyone said at Because a consensus forecast is a larger project than the minutes, I see there being time period, but in principal, this same process could section, instead of having us wait for a process, an initial version is distributed to participants who have a draft and to ask for changes.  A vote on the minutes is actually a vote to say represent a the meeting. a larger number of iterations over a longer be used.  Draft versions could also be circulated by complete draft, and you could probably make faster progress by doing it in sections.

assumption embedded in the QMPR.  By putting out world how we expect future U.S. monetary as conflict with the communications subcommittee statement in the May 25 memo a QMPR to be workable, it seems essential that this document are they a lot different?  But in expectation, we can make it clear that the Committee can and will circumstances in the macroeconomic outlook reason for wanting the market-based expectation.  Now, some central policy path going forward, depending on economic circumstances.  And if Finally, let me mention the policy such a report, we would essentially be telling the policy will evolve, not just in terms of the policy rate, but in terms of balance sheet policy well.  This may that 'For not convey the Committee's policy decisions….'  Other central banks have faced this question and found ways to resolve it.  Some central banks have used a market-based expectation of future policy at the time the forecast is made in the QMPR.  This is actually my preferred approach.  In most circumstances, the market assumption should be close to the FOMC's actual plan.  If they are a lot different, the Committee should be asking themselves, why using a market-based policy change the policy path in reaction to changing going forward.  That's my banks just don't worry about this so much.  They simply map out the future assumptions on all dimensions, and they try to make it as clear as possible that the projected policy path is subject to change

June 19-20, 2012

with what actually you will see a chart that has a tangled set of lines because the actual policy path did expected policy path with It's really a question of how comfortable is the Committee with laying is the Committee going to be in possibly forward.  The Riksbank is very comfortable over the past decade often you put a commitment out there that you're you look at the Riksbank's policy path over the past decade compared happened, not match the projected policy path on many different occasions.  But the Committee simply says that, well, economic circumstances change, so we changed our economic circumstances. out that future policy path, and then how comfortable changing that path going changing that policy path.  This Committee may or may not be as comfortable with that, and for that reason you could use the Bank of England's approach, which is to use the market-based assumption.  Then you don't have to feel like reneging on.

I agree with the Chairman and Governor Yellen and the as the 'Chairman's summary' of the view, and it is incumbent on the Chairman to get a good summary of the view of I think we should move ahead on this, but slowly and deliberately.  Fan It's always critical to be reminding people of how much uncertainty there is a market-based policy assumption and prevents the QMPR from a de facto policy document.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me just summarize. communications subcommittee that a QMPR is a good idea whose time has come.  The document should be characterized and thought of Committee's the entire Committee. charts will capture the diversity of views and will better communicate the extent of the uncertainty we face. around these forecasts, and that moving things around a tenth or two is not really that meaningful in the context of the uncertainty that's out there.

the an FOMC consensus forecast and a quarterly monetary policy report.  I see it as very useful enhancement to our policy communications.  As I have said before on a destination in some sense, and I view I do see no particular urgent problem in current communications development of such a report.  We currently to communicate to the public in addition to the statement, including conferences and speeches.  We also have the quarterly SEP and the policy report to the Congress. MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I do support this initiative to explore development of a potentially many occasions, increasing transparency is a journey, not this exploration in that light. that would necessitate rushing to a policy report.  Rather, I believe we should take time to fully explore the many nuances and issues surrounding have a variety of vehicles the Chairman's press semiannual actually can envision, for example, that the SEP and the report to the Congress could be expression of the range of views of the Committee-as President Bullard just in representing that-a consensus forecast that informs our opportunity to clearly articulate both the range of economic conditions as well as our policy strategy.  Done right, I believe that such a report enhance our policy communications. I collapsed into one monetary policy report that would provide three very important things:  a comprehensive noticed, fan charts can help a lot policy decisions, and the that go into our thinking can substantially

Chairman in conjunction with the July meeting, and I am comfortable along those lines.  For the purpose of the experiment, it seems reasonable to proceed, the Chairman be prior to the meeting and then soliciting participants' some alternative I think we can learn a lot from running the experiment that has been outlined by Governor Yellen and the proceeding as suggested in the memo and as augmented by the Chairman, with having responsible for drafting a consensus forecast views on whether they could endorse the forecast, had reservations, or preferred

June 19-20, 2012

In July this has a particular disadvantage to it because I envision, as President Bullard consensus forecast could be highly useful.  You won't have that a SEPs and doing those SEPs can be useful inputs into this forecast. discussed, that we would have a mechanism for submitting the SEPs, which actually captures the range of views.  Sitting in the Chairman's position, it seems to me that having those SEPs at his disposal as he begins to craft a in July, but we would have it in September.  I believe that can be very useful, whereas individually trying to collapse verbal conversations that might go on with everybody would be more difficult task.  Keeping the process.

is reasonable to operate under the assumption that the Chairman will retain ultimate for the consensus forecast and the narrative surrounding it.  However, whether this report ultimately will be useful and a communications vehicle is going to depend a lot on how this process plays out and goes into the consensus forecast, and more importantly for the report, up, that we around Chairmen remains to be seen, and we have to be a and a mechanism that is robust across different Even if the Chairman retains responsibility, I still envision Committee members vote on whether the minutes fully reflect what report would fully reflect the views and perspectives that It responsibility is a stable outcome or, put differently, whether the beneficial how it works and what how the diversity of views section is actually handled.  As President Kocherlakota mentioned, it's going to be important that we understand that whatever process we set this table have a lot of confidence in the Chairman and his ability and his skills to do this. Whether that will always be true with other little sensitive that we set up a process individuals that may sit in that chair. the Committee voting on the entire report, as President Bullard suggested, much like we do with the minutes whereby the happened in the meeting.  The policy

would vote both on the consensus forecast and went into developing our policy.  The Committee the accuracy of the report reflecting the range of views.

way we are going to get a better handle on how this is going to work is to try it, no doubt discover lots of pitfalls, troubles, and things we will have to iron out, but I give this a fair try and be willing to adapt it as we go along to fit we discover in the process.  I am very strongly in favor of having a monetary policy I would encourage us to begin this journey, but to do so at a very The only and we'll think it is important that we whatever report for some time, and deliberate pace.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Relative to could do are clamoring for.  I understand the benefits of a quarterly monetary policy that offers a richer narrative discussion of aspects of the forecast, and I agree with Yellen on the value fair amount already.  I think the SEP without too much bother. MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I don't have any deep objections to going ahead with this experiment, but I'm relatively skeptical of the benefits it offers us. the Summary of Economic Projections we do now, it's hard for me to see what else we that people out there report President Bullard, President Plosser, President Kocherlakota, and Governor of that.  But it is not clear to me that the SEP doesn't convey a central tendency ranges aren't that large in the grand scheme of things and that fan charts could be incorporated into the

Yellen made reference to an inordinate amount of time that might be required goes into a broader forecast I am not quite sure I see how the procedure gets around amount of time of all of us without essentially foregoing gathering that I bring on Governor to extract from Committee participants the textured information that that some other central banks do.  But requiring an inordinate information from us.  So I'm not sure what this accomplishes.  The other perspective

June 19-20, 2012

don't think market participants have had a lot and seeing how our communications tools vary with economic conditions.  I'm drawn to the we take the next step, and I'm throwing communications tools willy-nilly at the public, innovating at rapid pace in this dimension.  I have a really cautious view about this. this is that we have made a bunch of changes in how we communicate in the past year with what we did last August and what we did in January.  I of time, and I don't think we've had a lot of chances, to have some experience using it, changing it, idea of taking a pause on our journey and taking some time before wary of us being seen as an excessively

MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Many of my views have already been expressed, including some concerns.  I am overall Committee most recent policy decision-and if that were accompanied by the characterization of the consensus view on the degree of uncertainty communication and possibly enhance policy of implementation ideas, and they I more first-order conceptual question, one already discussed by President a starting point of formulating consensus avoids this challenge by consensus forecast on a market expectation for policy, and although it is my I thought the May 25 memo dealt with a number certainly are worthy of consideration, but before tackling those ideas, I would like to raise what would consider a Bullard, and that is the treatment of the policy assumption.  Continuing to condition on individual policy assumptions that would serve as forecasts could be problematic.  That is part of the problem with the current SEP.  And it is worth pointing out, as has already been noted, that the Bank of England basing the

June 19-20, 2012

that it is not done today, this approach was also suggested for the Riksbank by a government review panel. understanding recent Swedish we go forward, and that is that the FOMC a consensus rationale for policy decisions, rather, just arriving at decision for quite different reasons, and I am to wrap as many of us as possible into a consensus outlook and end of the day, very effective also the question of the Committee with a capital C, that is, changing makeup of the as we get toward the end of the Also I would make a slight cautionary note as is not designed for arriving at decisions.  Voters can choose to support a policy concerned that as we try rationale, the product could be diluted a lot and might not be, at the as a communications tool.  There's the voters or participants.  I prefer participants so as to get beyond the Committee and to avoid any question of the future relevance year.

Starting with preference.  The submissions could be in deriving a Now, let me respond to questions implementation matters. with the Committee, whatever that is, in developing the the Chairman's lead would be very helpful in getting this done.  But somewhat like President Kocherlakota, I'd prefer forecast submission versus essentially reacting to a forecast presented with the requirement of deciding how material one wants to consider differences something along the lines of the SEP would be my modified to deal with the question of the underlying policy assumptions, and then from these formal submissions, the Chairman, helped by the staff, could take the lead consensus forecast.

an experimental concept trial run or two or maybe three is certainly going forward.  However, I am a little hesitant to go down the implementation path Yellen seems very deliberate and careful to me.  I certainly endorse Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On the third question of whether it would be worthwhile to conduct exercise in July-yes, I think a proof of necessary without first resolving the question of how to deal with the policy assumption.

Regarding the narrative of the staff forecast is already provided in the FOMC meeting minutes and that adding some questions for us in the near term about explaining our decisions as clearly Despite these reservations, I I am, at this stage, a bit skeptical of its value relative to what we do today.

report similar to central banks would be useful.  It has obvious benefits in terms of more I want to mention something that is very carefully not just about the benefits, but also of the costs, In particular, we should focus, in my view, on the problem cost using our existing outlets, conferences, and the minutes. In a perfect world, I think publication of a quarterly monetary policy those published by other clearly and comprehensively portraying the consensus outlook, the risks to the outlook, and very importantly, the rationale for policy actions.  But important right now in that these benefits come with significant costs.  In approaching this undertaking, we need to think very especially in terms of staff resources. we are trying to solve and whether it can be addressed at lower such as the SEP, the Chairman's press am actually struck by the discussion and the comments so far.  There seem to be a monetary policy report as in done in other countries, comprehensive, verbal description of consumption, investment, and the not take a stand on which I am very much in sympathy with, that what we are trying to do is provide the rationale for our policy the forecast that goes with the policy decision-which is very I multiple objectives out there.  One is which provides this very entire economic outlook, and like President Bullard mentioned, really does policy.  It is more of a comprehensive discussion of economic conditions and the outlook.  Then I listened to President Kocherlakota's comments, expressed the view that decisions-that is, provide different than, say, what the Bank of England does.

staff resources, I am very concerned that the Board staff, in particular, has a a significant undertaking in terms of Regarding very full plate.  The subcommittee's proposals represent

June 19-20, 2012

to have no net staff, but I think that is going to be hard to do.  I would also just greatest burden today, and they are the ones who of something such as a QMPR.  Moreover, about future events and the fact that we may soon need to dig and liquidity policy tools, this is a attention from the all-important policy we actually need here and what we rely on so much for our policy staff time.  I know that the Chairman mentioned that an important goal was additional burden on the emphasize that key senior staff really have the are going to have a major role in the development given the heightened uncertainty deeper into our toolkit of unconventional monetary particularly inopportune time to distract the staff's analysis, which is what discussions and decisions.

we are trying to solve is to focus the public's attention on the forecast that underlines and provides the rationale for the policy decision, then a and the FOMC minutes.  President Kocherlakota gave an example of that example, the presentation of the SEP in charts, and the verbal description to highlight and focus attention on the for the policy decisions.  That is far less work, report.  In this model, in my view, the of views second fiddle to the main message of the If the main problem that consensus lower-cost solution might be to leverage our existing communication platform, such as the SEP, the press conference, in terms of the FOMC statement.  We could redesign, for terms of the tables, the consensus forecast, and this could be the consensus forecast of the voting members of the Committee.  It could be chosen by the Chairman based on, say, preliminary SEP submissions from the FOMC members as described in one of the memos.  I do see a great value in having the consensus forecast that provides the rationale however, than actually writing a quarterly monetary policy full range of SEP submissions would still be presented in order to convey the diversity across participants.  That information would play consensus forecast.  That is very important.  However, I also view, as Governor Yellen

It are not locked into group-think, focused on one point are regularly confronting and synthesizing a wide range of perspectives in mentioned, that the diversity of views portrayed in the SEP has advantages sends the important message that we forecast, but rather coming to our policy decisions.

From the point of view our communication with a consensus tools we already have and should put off development of a full-blown QMPR until from developing the consensus forecast existing means.  Thank you very much. In sum, I support developing a memo.  As President Plosser said, this is a journey of staff resources, we should now focus more on improving forecast using later, benefiting from the experience that we have through the

Historically, the diversity decisionmaking process, and it would be unfortunate if we moved to developing a forecast that encouraged more group-think and discouraged diversity of views.  The question of how we organize our discussion around the consensus forecast is critical.   In order to maintain the value of the

June 19-20, 2012

to suggest that we move up the SEP submissions by a week with the forecast before offering a consensus forecast.  A potential starting point for others have already made, and that is or two.  Then the Chairman would be able to consider the full range of projections along staff's preliminary the consensus forecast might be to take the midpoint of the central tendency, which would then reinforce the value of our independent analysis.

carefully vet any major shifts in our policy As best we can, we really need to see how this new approach in and policy circumstances.  I approach taken, I am convinced that we should you are recommending, how it performs through several meetings.  When we do make our communication approach, it is important that we vet it.  That sounds It is critical that we deliberately and communication strategy. generating a consensus forecast would work in different economic know that might be difficult, but regardless of the see, as this large of a change in like the approach that the subcommittee is recommending, and I am supportive.

comments that have been In general, I share the skepticism that President George and President Lacker memo, there is between the Committee and the participants.  It is important, as President Lockhart I am aware of, this is the only central bank that has rotating or I just have a few comments, Mr. Chairman, following up on the made heretofore. have expressed, and I am a little bit confused.  When you read through the interplay pointed out earlier, that we reflect the full view of the Committee because, unlike the Riksbank and every other central bank that occasional voters.  To capture that overall view, particularly as we approach a year-end, would

Bullard's proposal, which is that the ownership of this I would and if we develop this consensus forecast the full range of views of the reflected in the exercise. be very important.  I believe that President exercise would be vested in the Chairman, is perhaps the way to get around that, but hope that as we participants is questions, again, I agree with President George and President It may be an enhancement; I am not sure it will be a major enhancement.  We do have full rationale.  We have the SEPs.  We have we do it right, to present a more coherent and outlook.  But I am not sure how much it really adds at the margin, and I I do think that, as President Lockhart it.  That is not the problem; the problem is the good framework is adopted, it does serve as a commitment device, and it is what President Lockhart mentioned. With regard to the three Lacker. the meeting minutes, which I think provide a very our semiannual report to the Congress.  This would allow us to provide more detail to be communicated to the public and perhaps, if cohesive story about our would like to see that thought through a little bit more. pointed out, the real emphasis has to be placed on how policy is conducted, not really how to communicate or rationalize how we communicate conduct of policy.  But that being said, good communication is essential for implementing policy.  Once a policy important to underscore

partially addressed this what we are saying is that even if we have a full range of the participants' staff will years' experience here, the Board staff has generally certainly in the minutes it prepares after every meeting, and I would hope With regard to the second question and the third question-I've so far-basically views, which I would insist upon as being fair, in the end the Chairman and the Board be the final arbiters of the forecast and the narrative.  I do not think there is any other way to work it.  To their credit, at least in my seven been fair and balanced, that that would continue if we proceed with this exercise.  With regard to the third question-

June 19-20, 2012

would say yes.  I was struck by President Williams's comment that we already have a time when we have very difficult puzzles to solve, and I would it be worthwhile to conduct an experimental exercise in conjunction with the July meeting-I an enormous burden on the staff at think it will take several trial runs, and we should proceed quite slowly.  Those are my comments, Mr. Chairman.

would just like to conclude by saying that my one concern here with regard to a consensus, even in your able hands, is that it be a consensus of the entire table, not to make sure that we do not undercut what I consider to be our I was mentioning to one of our new Governors earlier, I do believe this is the we have to make sure that we reflect the table.  I know this brings a smile to your face, but I can tell you the we are.  We don't see it anywhere else, and we I hope it is incorporated. I developing just of the voters.  We need greatest virtue.  As last great deliberative body in Washington, and diversity of views at this Supreme Court is no longer as deliberative as need to reflect that richness that we have here at the table, and have other entire diversity of views Thank you, Governor Yellen. In summary, I would go very slow.  I would be mindful of the fact that we things that are very important presently, and I would hope it reflects the at this table.  And lastly, we are inundating the public and the markets with information.  This may provide some new information at the margin, but I am somewhat skeptical.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I very much support trying to move forward to develop a consensus forecast and a thank the subcommittee and Governor Yellen, for their efforts.  A lot of thought and I'm sure a great deal of time went into this exercise.

June 19-20, 2012

I have noted before, where we are right now is not a good place.  The SEP is deeply forecasts of economic growth and inflation, the ongoing potential for a disconnect the FOMC statement, what changes in the SEP mean when changes in the composition of the occur, such as Governor Powell's and Governor Stein's accession to this Committee. are not going to be obvious to the public.  And, much on our differences rather than our As flawed in a number of respects-no linkage of the individual interest rate forecast to the individual between the median SEP liftoff date relative to the liftoff date expressed in difficulties in assessing Committee That has changed the SEP, but in ways that lastly, the SEP unfortunately focuses attention very similarities.

going public.  A model in which the Chairman generates an initial consensus number of attractive features.  It is not can be done within a relatively short It is going to be up to date as circumstances change. We should take our time in doing this, and we should be willing to test several different approaches before forecast before seeking outside input does have a cumbersome, and it has the advantage that the individual Committee participants don't have to come up with their own forecasts.  Also, it presumably period of time.

are several potential shortcomings to this type of approach that we at least need forecast very central to the process.  Not only goal should be to have the policy deliberations and ultimately communicated in the monetary policy But there to note.  First, this approach could make the staff could this make it more difficult for the staff, over time, to produce a truly independent armslength forecast, but it also runs the risk that the consensus forecast would rest too heavily on a single model or perspective with respect to the economic outlook.  Second, and this is more important, a too-centralized approach without sufficient iteration might not lead to a true consensus.  This is critical because the judgments of the Committee match what is

June 19-20, 2012

consensus forecast.  If this doesn't all hang together, then we will still have conduct of monetary policy.  For you introduced a wrinkle, which I think maybe goes in the right alternative, and it might be interesting to try others. Chairperson changes.  I endorse what other people have said on that point. report in terms of the a problem in that what we are communicating doesn't match how we are actually evaluating the outlook and the reaction function that we collectively use in the these reasons, it might be worthwhile trying out other alternatives as well, and I note in your comments, Mr. Chairman, that direction.  Conceivably, you could start the process with the Committee participant submissions of those who wish to do so.  The Chairman could then develop the first iteration of the consensus forecast from these submissions.  That is one Third, as others have said, in conducting these experiments we have to think very carefully about how robust the process is likely to be over time, as the composition of the Committee and the identity of the

I do think that the process that there is an explicit endorsement of the outcome by the Committee. so that market participants will perceive that the forecast does in fact represent doesn't necessarily have to be agreement agreement that the consensus consensus.  In this latter case, the Committee Now, in terms of a vote or not a vote, I have been wrestling with this.  It is not clear to me that a vote on the consensus forecast is absolutely necessary, but has to conclude in a way This is necessary the Committee consensus.  Now, the endorsement about the consensus forecast itself, but, instead, could represent forecast is somehow a 'fair' representation of the participants could still endorse adoption of the consensus forecast, even if their own forecast differed in material ways from that consensus.

quarterly monetary policy report, I do think it is a good thing to work emphasis for right now, though, on developing a consensus forecast-the actually succeed in this first process. In terms of the toward.  I'd put the monetary policy report can be the caboose, assuming we

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Duke.

not to repeat a lot of what has already with an approach that meets all of the criteria that you laid Lockhart that we can come I am not sure we can come to a consensus on what led us to that action. I am not sure is possible with 19 different people. MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In order been said, I don't have any concerns out.  I am not certain how much stronger it is.  I agree with President to a consensus on action; A lot of our discussions on communication have really been discussions about a level of consensus that gone around the room, everybody seems to have different ideas of what this so I would be careful about that.  I also agree with President Williams and that this is not without cost.  And the trial period is particularly not going to do this without increasing the burden on staff, it would are not going to ask staff to do anymore after they start doing As we have idea actually means, and that we have to be careful without cost because if we are imply that there is something we this.

MR. TARULLO.  Sleeping.  [Laughter]

going to be doing both.  And so I think that it seems to me this any extra MS. DUKE.  When you are in a trial run, you are the trial period in particular will create some burden.  The second thing is changes the timing of our process because if we are going to submit projections two weeks earlier, then I need the Tealbook two weeks earlier.  I know that wouldn't create burden on staff!  And then, you would have the update to that Tealbook.  We do have to be careful on that.

would suggest a couple of things.  One is that we make a moratorium on other changes the fed rate to the SEP, and we have now been unhappy with some of the things we learned about I to our communication while we are testing this one.  We rushed out the changes adding funds

June 19-20, 2012

I worry that if we go back to that, all of a sudden we are now and the public is going say, 'Okay, are you changing that?  Is this the communication change that was foreshadowed in the If we think we have an idea of what we want to go to, we clear that this takes a backseat to policy action.  We are in an arena where consensus forecast and working on what we are going to do at the next the peculiarities of the size of our Committee and the voters versus nonvoters.  I liked the suggestions that were made by Presidents Kocherlakota, Williams, and Plosser on ways to change the statement.  But changing our statement in ways that are pretty noticeable, why minutes, or is it something else?' shouldn't do other things in the meantime.  And second, because this is going to create some burden, we should be policy action might require an awful lot of staff time, and I would hate to see them torn between working on the new meeting.  That could create some conflicts.

I can't imagine we'd get any congressional complaints report was too short or too skimpy, so we can certainly work on that as policy report.

Most other central banks have that our monetary policy we are doing the monetary that report quarterly without also doubling the opportunities for the Chairman to appear in front of the Congress and explain what it is that we are

the trial until September for two reasons.  One is that I think Europe is MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have two process comments.  The first is that I would defer much more pressing right now.  We should be focused on the brewing problems in Europe and

a lot more sense.  If we spend some time on aligned. that should be the topic of the July meeting.  And, the other is that it should be integrated with the SEP, and so doing it in September makes contingency planning in July, then we can spend September, I hope, thinking about these other things.  But we ought to get the priorities appropriately changing the dynamics of the meeting.  I came here with an I would have some One question I had was whether the tied to the release of the minutes.  It would be an emergency right FOMC meeting to try to integrate everything, and it would possibly allow integrating rather than having a completely separate press report. that we could jointly discuss around the table both the forecast and the would have some time to put that all together, you more time both to The second is tied to President Kocherlakota's comment that the policy and the forecast are intertwined.  I am worried about open mind about how we should be thinking about this and was hoping that of my views informed by everybody else around the table.  I would like that to continue with monetary policy as well as with this type of decision. consensus forecast and the press briefing could be change when you would do the press briefing, so that there would not after the some of the information into the minutes The advantage would be policy, and they would be intertwined.  Then we and it could come out at the time of the minutes, and that would give reflect on the discussion and to integrate it into the minutes process.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

comments.  Being part Governor Yellen's being exactly as clear a communications device as we would like, would help.  One of the big benefits in this is assumption on which MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I don't have any major of the subcommittee, I certainly endorse this proposal.  I share some of comments about the SEP not and so I think that the consensus forecast process that the consensus forecast would have some common monetary policy

June 19-20, 2012

economic outlook would be based.  At the moment, the SEP is at we have different policy assumptions, and we don't identify Governor Yellen was mentioning.  It is not possible to sort out the pieces as to why at our target next year and why you think it is not.  I think a assumption would be very good. everybody's opinions about the best a confused product because ourselves, as you think inflation is going to be common monetary policy want to note one thing that I picked up on when I was talking to my colleagues.  As I are not the easiest the way that you so very correctly and the opinions of the Committee and not just your own particular you would be one of the big beneficiaries from having a consensus assumptions, I am got together behind, as assumption, I would opinions on that. mind.  Thanks. I have observed your press conferences, Mr. Chairman, it strikes me that they place to go out and respond to questions, especially authentically try to convey opinions.  I would think that forecast.  In trying to describe the SEP, which is 19 different monetary policy not sure if it is possible to answer some of those questions.  But if we all best we could, some common forecast with a common monetary policy think that that would be a lot easier.  I would certainly be interested in your That is an important consideration, at least in my

our list.  Thank you for the comments. Tarullo? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  That is Governor

May I say just a couple of things, Mr. Chairman?  Thanks.  I have this-which is a all alternatives are imperfect.  A number of people MR. TARULLO. listened to what everybody here had to say, and one thing that came out of truism but probably bears repeating-is that have noted the imperfections in the current SEP, which I think are substantial.  People have anticipated imperfections in this as well.  I think that is why Janet proposed an elongated and

June 19-20, 2012

come up with a better iterative process here to try to figure out whether in fact we can alternative.

I would make is that I do think that the SEP is not serving us give more useful information to markets.  I have close attention to it, and while there is a very much attention to it at all, or to look at it Janet made two or three meetings ago about the need for have a divergence between forecasting and action, which creates The second point particularly well right now if the aim was to talked to a number of people who read this stuff and pay range of views, most people seem either not to pay as a kind of little game in which they try to find inconsistencies in the thinking of the Committee. This gets back to another point that something collective.  We now the kind of problems that Charlie Evans and Narayana were noting earlier.

I was listening to Narayana, it occurred to me that an important point here, which well, is what people think they mean by 'consensus.'  And I guess I of the term we could perhaps alternative judgments.  And that is a really we can ultimately achieve it.  I believe that is what subcommittee.  If I heard correctly, I think there is, in some cases, but in all cases willingness to let Janet's subcommittee do this on an I have a lot of sympathy for what Eric and John said about July, though. As Dennis underscored as would be a little bit skeptical if in the more literal and etymological senses come up with a consensus here.  But what we are looking for is some sort of collective judgment or, as Narayana would have it, a series of useful desideratum to have, whether or not Janet is trying to test with her reluctance or skepticism iterative basis.

I would make is, if we go down this road, this would be a wonderful the economic discussion that we have here, by with a series of readings of prepared statements on the economy, and about the forecast, The final point opportunity to fundamentally change the nature of which I mean dispensing instead actually moving toward a deliberation in which people, in talking

[Laughter]  One thing that was very clear is this needs to be a slow and to get the input from the Committee and what to do about the policy just state now I have at least a potential assumption because that doesn't endogeneity of policy to developments in the economy.  What you would ideally want can look at. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, okay.  Thank you very much.  So as usual, we don't quite have a iterative process, and we can certainly try that.  Some of the key questions raised were how best and at what stage assumption, and we will think about that.  Let me theoretical concern about taking the market rates as a policy allow the is some kind of rule, but, again, that is an issue we already had some discussions with David Wilcox and others, On the staff time, I have and we have in mind a process that will be very light on the staff.  I see Dave Reifschneider nodding his head, which is good news.  [Laughter]

Sorry, I was nodding to something Eric Engen said, not to you.

York purpose of testing operational readiness-small-value prudent planning, the Desk believes open First, I would like to ask the Committee to grant new authority to the New Fed to conduct-for the operations in the types of transactions described in the first paragraph of the Domestic Authorization.  This authority would essentially be an expansion of the November 2009 resolution authorizing small-value reverse repurchase agreement operations. Those operations have provided valuable opportunities for counterparties, clearing banks, and the New York Fed to identify and resolve operational issues before the tool is employed on a larger scale.  As a matter of that it is important to conduct similar exercises for other types of domestic market operations.  Specifically, we would like to perform small-value repurchase

Fisher. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Questions for Brian?  President your service.  Following the shoes very ably, and I want to thank you for you have done.  And I want to draw on your experience now to address your exhibit 3, What would be a rational amount for us to hold, just for the sake MR. FISHER.  First, again, Brian, thank you for distinguished line you followed, you filled those what number 16.  Would it be prudent in your view to have 0 percent holdings between zero and three years in the SOMA portfolio? of maintaining healthy market operations?

There are some consequences of taking our holdings to zero.  In particular, actually left us with a very odd profile of maturities extreme example is that in the middle of October we literally have a current procedure we would try to roll over into the MR. SACK. we won't have any of those securities available for our securities lending facility, and we won't be rolling over any securities into new, longer-run issues for securities lending.  The first program has already taken our holdings down meaningfully.  So to some degree, this effect is already in place, and the first program has and rollovers.  The most maturing issue of $200 that under our

Obviously, taking it to zero will take it to the extreme. type of issues-and securities lending, in particular-as secondary to the policy purposes of adjusting the portfolio in this way.  And of course, our not holding these securities means someone else will be, and those other investors may market.  So it is not clearly that detrimental to the to extending the MEP in the 6-torange where we would end up holding one-third, according to this table.  With exit, the sell side is always different than the buy side, and we are going to be holding a issuance in that maturity period.  Do you have any concerns about that; can ably negotiate our way through or sell our way through in a rising interest side, those we would be selling to? MR. FISHER.  And then the second question relates 30-year maturity regard to significant portion of the do you think we rate environment?  And how does it affect the buy

Let me say a couple of things.  First of all, the issue I was raising in the that, as our holdings go up in size as a portion of the market, at some point, we always It wasn't long ago we wrestled with whether we could increase the that may take us the entire market.  So we are in uncharted territory; it is hard to figure you can go.  But as I said in the briefing, because we haven't seen meaningful going. MR. SACK. briefing is have this concern about impairing market functioning-just associated with our holdings, not necessarily with sales. 35 percent limit on any individual security, and here we are considering policies basically to that limit for out how far problems with increasing our holdings to 30 percent, we are confident we can keep your question of whether we will be able to sell these securities, I think we will be able to sell the Treasury securities, even in a rising rate trading at a different In terms of are quite confident we environment.  Obviously, the securities will reprice, and the market will be

June 19-20, 2012

competitive level, but there is no reason we shouldn't be able to sell these securities through a process at market prices.

your exit strategy, which you may want example, the June 2011 exit principles rely on redemptions early and for for a number of years.  It is worth considering at your exit strategy, but I concerns about the actual ability to execute sales, however that falls into your Doing this operation does have consequences for to think through.

This will clearly reduce your capacity to shrink the balance sheet through that channel some point whether these actions warrant additional consideration of don't have any strategy.

MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Brian.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Brian, you show in number 16, 'SOMA Treasury Holdings as a Percent of Outstanding.'  What is the denominator there?

remind me what percentage of the total agency MBS market we exit issues or percentage holding issues with MS. DUKE.  Brian, hold, and then, in addition to that, are there any MBS that are different than for the Treasury market?

We face similar issues there.  If you look as a share of the market that we the $500 billion LSAP that was alternative A would take them to around 30 percent.  The same issue arises there that market and not knowing exactly where the line is. for MBS, we don't just look at the effect on the net attention to the flow of our relative to production, because one thing we learned in the first LSAP was that, unlike securities, it was very hard to go out and pull MBS out of the secondary market.  It a result, we are a little bit more tuned in to not relative to gross issuance.  When we calibrate capacity there, we take that into MR. SACK. transact in-fixed coupon, TBA-eligible-type agency securities-I think our current holdings are probably in the low 20 percent of outstandings, and I believe that presented as about getting to a relatively sizable part of However, when we think about capacity supply or on our share of the total outstanding.

one final question for you.  [Laughter] [Laughter] MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  And thank you, Brian, for outstanding service to the Federal Reserve System.  I do have MR. SACK.  Is it about market functioning?

claim that we have impaired the functioning of the repo market, but the increase of 15 basis points is in the ballpark of some ranges of the MEP on the long end of the curve in the other direction.  I'm my recollection of the theory of the case for there are close substitutes for reserves, especially given the two, three years maybe.  So two-, three-year securities as close the case for MEP? MR. LACKER.  I take it you wouldn't Treasury estimates of the effect of wondering, do we still know that the MEP is, on net, stimulative?  Or is this a contractionary offset we need to take into account?  Related to that, MEP was that at the very short end expectation that the price of reserves would remain very low for should this lead us to revise that sense in which we view substitutes for reserves, and, thus, the theory on which we built

A couple of things to note.  First, we are unsure the extent to which this rise among market participants. Treasury supply do have effects on repo rates.  It is probably part of the story, but it is hard to know if it is the a role.  And, of course, Treasury supply was increasing to would be I don't think that effect is large enough to offset the positive benefits of we are unsure of the size of the effects, we also permanent.  We think that, once the supply works its way through the MR. SACK. in overnight rates is associated with the MEP.  It is a common story We have done some empirical analysis suggesting that changes in transitory only factor or to what extent it is playing over this period for other reasons, not just because of our sales.  Having said that, to the extent it is putting some upward pressure on short-term interest rates-and if those were expected persist-it would be tightening financial conditions in a way that presumably counterproductive.  But taking the duration out of the market.  And while don't think that they are

June 19-20, 2012

you suggest. dealer balance sheets, we will see the upward pressure on repo come off.  And for those reasons, maybe it is not quite as concerning as a result of the repo rates at 25 basis points is not productive for get the most accommodative financial conditions.  From a policy perspective, you could it's worth trying to lower them. But it is very much an open issue.  You could say, well, whether this is maturity extension program or not, having trying to ask the question if

follow up on President Lacker's comment, if we were to Lacker is concerned about? MR. ROSENGREN.  Just to lower the interest on excess reserves, would that likely put downward pressure on those rates that President

We believe it would put downward pressure on overnight rates.  Our guess you are truly interested in you could also consider just repos. MR. SACK. is that the effect on the repo rate would be less than one for one.  If lowering the repo rate, you could consider an IOER change, but directly doing

Kocherlakota. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President service, and on a personal level, I have learned a tremendous amount from your basis.  I have two questions.  The first question is about panel 14.  Do MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  And thank you, Brian.  You have given great briefings on an ongoing you have narratives from the survey about why the respondents felt that changing the balance sheet was so much more likely than changing rate guidance?

a good, complete narrative on that, but we certainly have a is a view that moving guidance to late 2014 was already quite aggressive.  It is very hard to know how the the responses would be that the probability of a change in the rate guidance over the course of year goes up quite a bit.  As time marches on, and late 2014 gets closer, I think there is a give guidance into 2015. MR. SACK.  We don't have sense from our broader discussions with market participants.  I think there the rate forecast will unfold that far out, and there were questions about how meaningful providing a forecast beyond that into 2015 would be.  Having said that, I would note consistent with the idea the next perception of more scope to credibly second question is about the very low I am right or wrong on MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you.  And my level of the term premium.  I would guess-and you can inform me if

Obviously, we don't have a market reading on the term premium itself.  We that allows us to assess the perceived skew And, indeed, swaptions suggest that the skew has moved up I think that is get to unusually low levels and the downside of a an increase in rates.  But of course all of those risks are embedded in the yield, so the perceived risk around that yield. MR. SACK. have an options market on longer-term interest rates around longer-term interest rates. meaningfully in the direction of higher odds of an increase in interest rates. actually a natural reaction in the market as rates the distribution is limited.  There has generally been a greater market perception of at least larger risk of this is about the shape of

But what we into the Treasury's broader debt management it issuing more duration over time. MR.

Even without deposit runs in other euro-area countries, particularly Spain.

Deposits in Italian banks have been steady, but as shown to the right, CDS premiums on Italian banks are even higher than on Spanish banks, and they funding would be of little help against a deposit run.

A substantial portion of the markdown reflects our revision to the euro area, but it has also been affected by the weaker outlook for the United States, which David Lebow will discuss, and a somewhat weaker outlook for China as well.

A number of indicators of Chinese activity in April came in soft, including loan growth and industrial production, shown in the middle-left panel.  May data were a bit better, but overall the anticipated.  We marked down our forecast for Chinese growth this quarter percentage point and for one potential source of concern.  The middle panel points to an increasing unsold inventories among real estate developers.  However, it is not clear at this stage that a severe correction is in process.

Some of the other emerging market economies have also fared poorly of late, held down by both weaker exports and domestic factors.

We marked down our EME forecast in face of the weaker outlook for Europe and the United States, but we expect growth in the EMEs to gradually firm as advanced economies pushed commodity prices down.

As grown fairly well, exports to the euro area remain below their 2008 current Tealbook forecast with a counterfactual in which euro-area U.S. GDP growth in the second half of this year and in recovery.  I will now turn things over to David As shown in line 1 of the table, we expect the higher dollar and weak foreign activity to cause U.S. real export growth to slow over 2012 and 2013 before picking up in 2014, while imports, line 2, are projected to forward as the higher we expect net exports, line 3, to subtract roughly growth the rest of this shown in the bottom-left, while U.S. exports to countries outside the euro area (the red line) have average.  To examine the effect of the euro-area crisis on the U.S. economy, we compared the GDP (shown in the middle panel) and the broad nominal dollar (to the right) instead follow the paths predicted in the June 2011 Tealbook, just before the crisis intensified.

Your next exhibit describes our medium-term projection.  Although the tone of the incoming data plays some outlook in this Tealbook is the situation in Europe that David Bowman just discussed and the associated effects on financial markets.  The stronger exchange value of the dollar, worsened prospects for foreign growth, and decline in equity prices that have occurred since the time of the April FOMC meeting all derive primarily, in from developments in Europe, and all restrain the in global oil prices factors, but they offset only part of the weakness continuation year of the situation we've had in the first half of this year, with GDP With all of these changes, our projection now calls for essentially a through next

While this scenario is obviously not our an outcome this bad as being As we discussed in the Tealbook, we view the uncertainty projection as being larger than usual, and with the downside.  Of course, the most salient risk at present is the situation in Europe. David discussed some of Tealbook, we presented one particularly severe scenario as baseline forecast.  In this plunges into a severe financial crisis, and real GDP there (the lower-left panel) falls sharply. including a sizable further appreciation of the dollar, sharply wider U.S. bond spreads, a much weaker stock market, and some confidence.

Again, under the baseline path, the increase in fiscal drag is one reason that GDP (shown to the right) only Under the fiscal cliff scenario, the dashed line, GDP growth is weaker still, and the unemployment rate (shown at the lower left) moves back up to 8½ percent next year and in 2014.

The latest data on core consumer prices-including the CPI for May, which was published last week after the Tealbook and as shown by the red line in the top-right panel, the 12-month change in core PCE prices has edged lower in the past few months.  Gasoline prices through May reflected some but not 12-month change in total PCE prices (the black 1½ percent in May.

Preliminary data suggest that the revamped HARP 2.0 program has eased some constraints for borrowers with high mortgage loan-to-value ratios, likely contributing to the recent increases in refinancing.

a disorderly Greek financial disruptions across Europe, maybe Turning to exhibit 10, the risk to the U.S. financial system emanating from Europe has become more proximate since the April FOMC meeting.  As noted in the top-left panel, despite Sunday's election results, the possibility of exit from the euro remains a real possibility.  And the mounting pressures on Spain and its banks raise the prospect of broader even involving runs on banks, the imposition of capital controls, and the exit of more than one country from the euro.

Financing Terms reported In addition to hits to asset prices from such disruptions, as noted to the right, a rapid exit from the euro and redenomination could stress the European payment, clearing, and settlement systems-a vulnerability to financial stability that we have not previously highlighted.  Given the dependence of financial institutions around the world on these systems, an interruption of their normal operation could disrupt market functioning and impair credit intermediation-even in the United States. Perhaps in recognition of risks posed by Europe, two-thirds of the respondents to this month's Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer having increased the amount of resources and attention devoted to the management of concentrated exposures to central counterparties and other financial utilities.

Indeed, most you now see the risks to GDP growth as weighted toward the downside and, risks to unemployment as weighted to the upside.  In your narratives, you attributed your sense of increased uncertainty and downside risks to about the debt crisis in Europe; other explanations included the general slowdown in growth, including the possibility of a hard landing in China.

Questions for Ellen?  Governor Tarullo. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  Are there questions for our colleagues?

you.  When we release the projections with the minutes, is What is in this packet that is not in the publicly released summary? MR. TARULLO.  Thank everything in here?

MS. MEADE.  The scatter plot in exhibit 3 is not.

am sure it has occurred to all you before-but somehow I was slow, and it only occurred to me this time-that when we inflation levels at different stages of liftoff, they are not factors, right?  Because my assumption would be that if we go three more just wanted to make sure that the unemployment number associated boxes in particular is not being compared directly with those reflected in the triangles. MR. TARULLO.  Okay, good.  That relieves my concern.  I of compare GDP or unemployment or PCE a comparison of like years with this kind of economic growth, or lack thereof, structural unemployment really will be higher than it is today.  I with the That's all.

other questions about the projections?  [No questions?  Vice Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are there any response]  Okay, other

June 19-20, 2012

first time I can remember that the international piece came I think tells you that it is the number one risk. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  That was a lot of material to digest, and you very much focused on the key issues.  It's the first, which fiscal cliff.  On changed.  Is it that what before was a big downside risk some more things have happened that morphed the over the threshold, so that now it is in the central forecast?  Or did something material and today?  I'm trying to get a sense of whether the a small change in Europe that just tips you over the line or I have two general sets of questions, one on Europe and one on the Europe, I want to understand what has wasn't part of the central forecast?  Now situation happen in Europe between the April meeting shift is being driven mainly by something more major that happened in Europe.  That is my first question.

A couple of things happened.  We did get macrodata for April and And whereas the first quarter was fairly good, the April and May data clearly show them near term, is the result of data.  The other thing that has occurred-it was already occurring at the time of the now fairly clear-is that financial conditions have gotten worse.  The risk probably seems clearer.  We had the Greek elections-Greek election one and Greek election two.  We've gotten other data for Spain that show the deposit outflows that I amount of funds that it would need was a good it will be in the lending program for their banks.  So a brought that tail that we always knew was out MR. BOWMAN. May. again on the downtrend.  So part of the markdown, certainly in the incoming April FOMC, but it is of a Greek exit then talked about.  We had the news about Bankia; the deal more than people thought, and now number of factors have worsened, and I think they there a bit closer in.

I could just add to those remarks on the issue of the new developments. MR. KAMIN.  If Back when conditions worsened in European markets between the March and April Tealbooks,

June 19-20, 2012

whether this was something that actually had legs, or were we looking at a little bit in the April that a dynamic had now set in, in which the markets were going to response on the part of the And that became particularly evident as we passed two events that in 9 package for Spanish banks, and then, more Greece.  There, it was pretty obvious that the market bounce, if there short-lived.  So it became much more apparent to us that basically the we had to decide normal volatility in markets?  And so we worsened our forecast maybe Tealbook but didn't do a lot.  As financial conditions deteriorated between the April Tealbook and now, we recognized continue to get worse until there was a very concerted policy European authorities. principle could have heartened markets-the June recently, the election for was any, was incredibly dynamic had set in, and the situation was going to get worse until something made it get better.

as opposed to a risk that might or might not materialize. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So it is now sort of the central baseline something that was

Right.  But to be clear, the central baseline is one of mounting financial MR. KAMIN. stresses that eventually will become severe enough to prompt a fairly aggressive European response.  The central baseline is not the meltdown scenario that is in the Tealbook alternative, or the more advanced stresses that David referred to in his discussion.

From my perspective, it seems like you have an awfully mild impact of plunging over the especially given that you are at the zero bound with no ability to offset the fiscal cliff and the rest of the world is very weak.  You have the European you have a big fiscal contraction along with a big confidence effect because if you plunge off the fiscal cliff, it is not just fiscal cliff, but also a tremendous loss of confidence in the political process in VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Understood.  The second question I had was on the fiscal cliff. fiscal cliff, through monetary policy economy in contraction.  For the U.S. economy presumably plunging off the

June 19-20, 2012

had, I think, a mild recession in 2013 but a deeper one than what any fiscal contraction, the economy would be year 2013.  I'm curious why plunging off the fiscal cliff in your than what you had.  It seemed an awfully mild effect.  I wouldn't want its hands on that. the United States.  The CBO you have.  And CBO was assuming that, absent growing 4.4 percent in calendar view isn't more negative the Congress getting can mention one thing regarding the comparison of our estimates with you look at the effects that we built in over the course of 2013 and 2014 are actually quite similar.  However, our gradual spending response to the tax-change parts of the fiscal cliff.  The CBO a much faster spending response, so it has a bigger hit concentrated right at the more important reason for the difference between our MR. LEBOW.  I the CBO's.  If combined, compared with CBO's assumptions, they models assume a was assuming beginning of 2013 than we do.  That is the assessment and CBO's assessment.

estimates are reasonable.  Obviously, ours are our best MR. LEBOW.  Yes.  The CBO's shot, but they could be larger than we have built in.

Fair enough. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Okay.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans.

going out two to three years?  What I have in mind is that the periphery an internal devaluation along with austerity programs.  It is not hard to MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Two questions.  What is the Tealbook scenario for Europe countries are clearly not competitive, and they need some type of devaluation, which currently is being pursued as speculate that this is going to lead to political turmoil and be largely unsuccessful in most of

June 19-20, 2012

for Greece and other countries is exiting transfers. a different segment of the populace. am wondering if somewhere in between is there an intermediate set of outcomes that about this in your outlook. those countries.  At any rate, one bookended alternative the euro and see how things play out afterwards.  The other end of the bookshelf is full fiscal union where the northern European countries and core Europe agree to some sort of That seems likely to lead to political turmoil, too, among And so I are sustainable over some two-, three-, or five-year period; how does the situation play out, or is that the empty set?  You have to be thinking

Yes, we are.  On the empty set part, I guess we will see over time.  But is-assuming that stresses will get worse this year-that if Italy or Spain, or both, won't at that point if the firewall prevails.  And we assume, even if the current level would politically just simply raise the size of point, with whoever needs to be out of the market for at least a bit, our 2013 forecast is gradually declining over time, in our baseline going out to 2014.  We assume that over that timeframe end of 2014, we've got overall a union is probably in progress, and then we see not stunning economic growth in 2014 and going forward.  That's the basic scenario. MR. BOWMAN. our baseline need programs, they will get programs, and that will take them out of the market.  They need to borrow isn't enough, that in a severe enough situation they the firewall.  And at that stresses will gradually decline, though not overnight.  That's one reason why a lot worse than many others-we have these stresses only although they do decline the moves toward fiscal and financial union will gradually increase and that these governments will be able to improve their fiscal situations.  So that by the better situation in which the fiscal outlook has improved for these countries, the move toward a more sensible monetary growth but moderate get that type of question, I also try to provide MR. EVANS.  When I'm in public and I that type of hopeful response.

June 19-20, 2012

We talked about the risks to this.  They are palpable.  We are assuming Ireland and Portugal will need further programs. MR. BOWMAN. that

The only point I would add-just to make it seem like we are not just you the same PR [laughter] as the people you are talking to-is that this outlook that we written down is that a couple of years of recession, economic growth in 2014 will be 1 percent.  And that is for and France doing going into very steep recessions.  Our baseline economic growth, something than Japan, but that might be the way to think about it.  This is an outlook that we no means desirable, MR. KAMIN. giving have written down for the euro area is actually very bleak.  What we have after the euro area in aggregate, which is the combination of Germany doing okay not horrible, and the peripheral economies actually encompasses a pretty prolonged period of very lackluster that is shorter think is not politically impossible and not financially impossible, but it is by and it is not particularly sanguine.

you extend it to 2017.  I notice that your projection had a feature that my own projections myself to change.  First, let me say that I thought that Tealbook B, was you showed some additional simulations of FRB/US optimization in the above and meaningful period.  And that is true using the a very small weight on the unemployment It was also true for the nominal income targeting, but that is not related to the optimality.  In MR. EVANS.  The other question I had was related to the Tealbook's long-term outlook, where had, which I can't bring extraordinarily innovative this time because with different loss functions and weights on the dual mandate: resource slack and inflation goals. And so when I looked at the optimal control response, which is solving the spirit that it is meant to be solved-that is what I can't bring myself to do-it ends up providing more accommodative policy for a longer period of time in a way that has inflation going the 2 percent objective for some noticeable standard weights, but it was true even when you put leg.

June 19-20, 2012

ante expectation that inflation is going to go I can't bring myself to put that particular inflation path into I have inflation going up to 2 percent.  Isn't there a mean, there must be something else at work in the Tealbook.  Is the you're not doing optimal policy there? my opinion, it looks to me like this shows that any real attempt to do the optimal with regard to dual mandate objectives is going to lead to some ex above that 2 percent threshold.  But my projections.  Like the long-term outlook, tension in all of this?  I answer that the estimated outcome-based and allow the FRB/US dynamics to play out. That said, from the beginning of the long-term period out, it is quite a mechanical exercise, and MR. WILCOX.  Yes. The long-run outlook is governed by rule, and we tie ourselves to that quite mechanically So the medium-term outlook is a judgmental outlook.  At the end of the medium-term period, we hand over the projections to the model, which we tried to tailor in some ways so that its dynamics more closely resemble what we think the analytics of the staff projection are. being monetary policy is represented by the estimated outcome-based rule.  In some sense, this is just what is ground out by that process.

grounded in any sort of MR. EVANS.  Right.  So it looks like a rule that is not really optimality with respect to the objective function that the policymakers have.

MR. WILCOX.  That's right.

And something that is grounded in the objective function, even with a low would tend to have more accommodation and, ex ante, run a risk I noted earlier, I think the the press question that he has gotten, at least for the past several press Thank you. MR. EVANS. weight on the resource slack, that inflation would go above the target.  I mention this because, as Chairman does a fabulous job of fielding tremendously difficult questions in conference, and this is a conferences.  And I thought this was very helpful.

June 19-20, 2012

It has a lot that we have talked about before here about the credibility of the of the Committee.  The Committee is assumed to be able to credibly you wondered about the ability of the Committee to make that you wondered whether-even if the Committee in some sense could commit a trajectory that you could necessarily get MR. ENGLISH.  Just one other point, though, on the optimal control policy. of assumptions buried in it assumed future behavior commit to a path for the funds rate, and that path is believed by the public and taken into account by the public.  And so if commitment, or if to do that-it would be believed, then this may not be to.

that is certainly true, but I don't know how that cuts.  By 'this,' do alternatives, you wouldn't want to do that optimally?  It just strikes me as who have looked at something like this might argue that when you are when the resource slack objective is you would do more.  And if I was running into some type lines of what you're talking about, the optimal response might be to do I'm not quite sure what. MR. EVANS.  Well, you mean it is not possible to push the inflation projection above 2 percent?  Or that taking into consideration those odd.  And other people bringing the inflation projection in from below at a time doing so badly, you would expect that of impediment along the something wildly more in order to overcome that.

you can do is push back liftoff. I think President Bullard has said in the But if you don't think you can credibly commit to a funds rate path way out, that may be you can do now, and it is credible. are costs and risks associated with additional balance sheet action, you may be constraints on the ability of the Committee that are worth MR. ENGLISH.  But in the optimal control exercises all There aren't additional balance sheet actions here, as past. an argument for doing balance sheet action.  That's something But if there hesitant to do that.  So there are thinking about.

June 19-20, 2012

Lacker, you had a two-hander? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President reaction function differs from what fits the recent past.  Am I right about that?  And if so, and then it represents fully credible. MR. LACKER.  Yes.  So the optimal control policy you would think best a one-time change that is instantly

Yes, I think that's right.  It represents a behavior that isn't necessarily past behavior. MR. ENGLISH. consistent with

It just has the past data, right. MR. LACKER.

Lucas critique issues are all about.  It is about trying to of the economy, and then asking whether or not you somehow choose a say, well, that is not structural.  The just another variant of that. MR. EVANS.  That's what understand the structure policy that can achieve something different than ever has been achieved before, and then go out and sell it to people.  Just because it doesn't fit, we routinely Lucas critique would say we shouldn't give in to that.  This is

Lacker. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President you know, President Evans, this is the critique of the Lucas critique in drawing conclusions from a one-time change implemented in a model in the manner in which Lucas MR. LACKER.  As that Sims has raised-that one needs to be careful perfectly credible policy advocated.

could be simpler structural changes, though, in terms estimated close to optimal. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  There of the behavioral equations, for example.  The Taylor rule is just an empirically relationship.  And if the economy has changed, it may no longer be

you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to focus on the question of Greek are throwing around the phrase 'exit' very blithely here.  What does exit you know, there are two treaties in it wanted to, because it's a sovereign country, but that probably would not want to go that route.  It is its own currency.  I could imagine, nevertheless, it printing are a lot of issues here that suggest as clean an event.  It is not like you wake up one Monday morning, and 'Okay.  We have exited, and now we are going our separate ways.'  It is a more I want to get my head around-what you are the more logical scenario is that there will just be debt over several years, and so we gradually not pay a lot of the debt, or MR. BULLARD.  Thank exit.  I think we actually mean?  And what can be achieved through exit?  As Europe for the EU and the EMU.  They have legal obligations within the European Union. Greece could abrogate those treaties if would have a lot of implications for the nation.  It supposed to have renounced printing its own currency and having dual currencies.  So I think there that exit is not nearly you say, complicated thing than that.  That is one thing thinking on that.  And the other is whether ongoing restructuring of maybe all of the debt, for some of these countries?

MR. BULLARD.  So what does it mean?

you probably know, there is no actual legal way to leave has interpreted that as the only legal way that be in the euro area. could in theory do it legally under the existing EU treaty, the Lisbon you want to leave, and then there is a committee, and you negotiate an exit.  And if after-I believe it's two MR. BOWMAN.  All right.  As the euro area.  You can leave the EU, and the ECB you can leave the euro area because you have to be a member of the EU to It's possible that Greece Treaty.  Now, to do that, you have to say the EU makes a proposal, and hopefully

June 19-20, 2012

haven't agreed, you get to leave anyway.  It's possible they could you could simply not invoke any law, just simply leave-impose capital controls, treaties.  They wouldn't really have a years or three years-they speed that up, and it could all be done legally.  Other than that, you could invoke the Vienna Convention, or impose a bank holiday, redenominate outside of the EU way to stop that.  We don't think it would be in any way clean for Greece; it would be a horrible disaster.

a stamp the old currency and use that.  Now, we are in an electronic age.  It is could really do it over the weekend or over a week.  This is a country collect taxes-can't determine how many swimming pools people have-and it could really have a solid set of capital controls that would stop the euros from plausible either.  We don't think that it would be in any way clean.  We think and potentially quite frightening to everybody else, but countries as people witnessed what was But we are distinguishing that from a situation where it stays within the sort of defaults by pushing back the amount that it pays Greek exit.  Does that make sense? In past currency union breakups, they have been able to do it over the weekend or over week.  You just questionable whether they that can't really the thought that leaving is not very it would be a big mess for Greece particularly quite a big mess for some of the other happening in Greece. euro area but either defaults or simply over time.  That is not what we mean by you mean by Greek exit? MR. BULLARD.  What is not what

Greece stays within the euro area.  It continues to it defaults on part of its debt to the public sector or the public sector simply are effectively MR. BOWMAN.  Something where use the euro, but forgives some of it over time or just keeps pushing back the payment so that they forgiving some of the time, but that is not what we mean by exit.  Those things can be messy, too.

You mean where it stays in the euro area? MR. BOWMAN.

That would depend on what the rest of the euro area does in response while Greece is still running primary deficits, the euro area just cut off all collapse anyway, right?  Greece could be facing a very recession even under those conditions.  It is matter of debate whether at that point it euro area and letting its currency depreciate a lot or trying to stay MR.

clear about our Tealbook baseline forecast, we are not assuming in the euro area forever or even assuming that it stays in through the subtle, is that basically we do not expect within the next couple of months.  On the one hand, if it did leave MR. KAMIN.  Just to be that Greece will stay forecast period.  Our assumption, which is a little Greece to leave the euro area the euro area that quickly, we think that could be enormously disruptive both within Greece and outside for all of the reasons that we've talked about.

reasons that you and David have just talked about, we don't think it's that able to leave the euro area that quickly.  So the chain of events that would lead to a Greek exit is one where the Greek government But for the plausible that they would, indeed, want to or be most likely starts negotiating again with the European Union because the current terms of the bailout

That set of negotiations could take any number of reasons, at that point, there is Greece missing a payment to the EU because compliance with the it cannot provide any more cash to meet that run.  As things get worse, the Greek holiday, and imposes capital controls.

If negotiations break down for some period of indeterminacy, perhaps followed by it has to repay the European authorities starting with a big payment in August.  Then at some point maybe there is an actual default, and they are declared outside of program.  Then, if deposit runs have not started already, they start in earnest, and the ECB decides government freezes the banks, declares a banking number of months down the road, then it might say, 'Geez, adopting of the euro is probably our best option because we are practically by the time Greece actually will be ready for it, and it could happen without huge If a year from now encompassed within our That is the chain of events that could lead to a Greek exit, but it is not something that we think will happen overnight.  If that does happen, we think that leaves, European policymakers probably disruptions to the European and global financial system.  That is a scenario that is very broadly within the confines of our baseline, albeit at the most pessimistic end of it. Greece were not in the euro area, that outcome, indeed, could be Tealbook baseline.  On the other hand, if it somehow decided to leave tomorrow or next week, that would not be encompassed in our baseline.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  I have President Fisher, Governor Raskin, and President Kocherlakota, and I would urge us to move on after that.

To reflect, I was happy to see the report was not very uplifting.  And, to MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. international side lead the presentation, although the

We make some adjustment to the futures curve based on our participants.  If that differs from ours, for us to be some adjustment to the futures curve.

If we are more pessimistic, then we would expect prices to fall as financial market participants learned over time that they had been too MR. BOWMAN.  That's correct.  We look at the assuming that we're commodity optimistic; we also correct for our forecast of movements in the dollar.

I talk to, but it is in accordance to what I'm hearing from the Exxons and so on.  The MR. FISHER.  Again, for what it is worth, these are just pixels in a broader picture of the people that

pleased with the current price range, and of course, you have this enormous here in the United States as well. Saudis are very production surge

MR. BOWMAN.  Yes.

I am hearing all the I am also hearing increasing concern about China, and that goes to your second the charts.  And to go back to your expression, does this have legs?  If you Lee Kuan Yew, in Singapore, there is a deep concern over China right am just wonderingwe have tended to be a little bit more negative in the Tealbook, which is good because that there is a knock-on effect from Europe.  We can see a getting dramatically worse, or is it something we just need to monitor carefully?  What am worried about is that Europe is a much-discussed risk factor, but I want to make sure we are to be increasingly complicated and more comments on China?  And I know that the Chairman wants to pick up the pace you could do that quickly, thank you. MR. FISHER.  The third point goes back to the international side.  What from nonfinancial business operators is, of course, a concern about Europe because of uncertainty.  But line of exhibit 3 of travel through the peripheral countries to China, Indonesia, all the way to Japan and Korea, or you visit with people like now, much deeper than seems to be reflected in the numbers.  And I because you have been right.  We know diminution in trans-Pac cargo flows from air or sea.  How bad do you think things are in China? Are they I not taking our eye off the Chinese ball, which seems difficult.  So any here, but if ample room to China in my presentation, and the April And the real estate sector has been the source of potential risk for some time, and it is concern.  Indicators, like the one I showed on the amount of unsold inventory, are a MR. BOWMAN.  Well, as we discussed, we believe that the risk of a hard landing has increased in China.  We did want to give and May data were unquestionably weaker than we had expected and, I think, than markets expected. the source of

June 19-20, 2012

a far have been gradual and largely government.  Right now we don't see a severe ample room to increase monetary or policy stimulus if there does appear to be a sharp slowing in economic growth.  In in which a political transition is going to take place, they have a lot of So we see slowing as a risk.  We right now, and we do have some faith that there is worry, and there have been reports for a long time that real estate developers could be highly overexposed, which would then feed back to the banking system and feed into the nonperforming loans.  The Chinese authorities, to some extent, have attempted to engineer housing slowdown, so the price declines that we have seen so seem to have been desired on the part of the contraction in real estate, but we are not trying to downplay the potential risks.  On the other side, though, we believe that the Chinese authorities have fiscal particular, in a year incentives not to see a sharp slowdown in economic growth. don't think a sharp contraction is under way ample room for policy stimulus.  It is not our baseline, but we do acknowledge that the risk has increased.

MR. KAMIN.  And, in fact, if we did not think it was an important risk, we would not have put it as an alternative scenario in the Tealbook, which we have.

other suggestion I have is next time, Mike, when you make a MR. FISHER.  The only presentation just conclude with, 'Have a nice day.'  [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  On that note, Governor Raskin.

Back to the fiscal cliff.  Is the question of the debt ceiling either built into It wasn't clear to me what the Tealbook assumes I would imagine would be the confidence-deflating effects of a prolonged debt MS. RASKIN. the baseline or into the alternative simulation? about what ceiling debate.

June 19-20, 2012

of brinksmanship, and so on.  So we did build in some sentiment effect year, but we are not assuming any particular effect on consumer from the debt ceiling. MR. LEBOW.  Well, even in the baseline we do have some confidence effect built in associated with the fact that our baseline fiscal assumptions are consistent with there being some delays and some degree for that around the turn of the confidence along the line, with all of the legislative vehicles that are going to have to move MR. WILCOX.  The fiscal situation could be even worse.  We have assumed that somewhere through the Congress, that there will be an increase in the debt ceiling along with appropriations or some other vehicle that will avert default on the U.S. debt.  Even in our fiscal cliff scenario, we assume that the debt gets taken care of.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.

will forgo the pleasures of Lacker until later. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I getting involved in the discussion between President Evans and President read through chart 12 and listened to the, as usual, excellent financial stability report risks that are emerging in them.  I'm puzzled by why we don't see more of just one picture out of very many things in the upper right in exhibit 12 showing the equity options-implied cost I like to look at-and I do not see a big change at all.  If I look at VIX, I don't know what it is today, but yesterday it was as in January.  I wonder what your thoughts are on that. I with an eye to the following question.  I think you amply describe the Europe, and that we should be concerned about an imprint of those risks in U.S. asset markets.  I look at that we look at, the chart of insurance-these are exactly the kind of things since January in that basically the same

It is puzzling actually.  Given the proximity of these tail events thought we'd see a much more elevated VIX.  When we were putting MR. PALUMBO. especially, I would have

June 19-20, 2012

I could see or election.  It wasn't as if there and dire and focused on the adverse The VIX canyou made clear in your speech two weeks ago-provide good information that we try to cull is not a terrific forecaster of going to happen.  In the summer of 2008 there were plenty of days when the VIX was days when it was trading in the 18s than in the 30s.   I think it is just one where, as Brian put it, we view financial markets as in a fragile state.  When you reports that you are hearing about short-term funding markets, those stresses a little worse day by day by day, even as measures like the VIX and the are actually reversing course.  So I do think there is an uncomfortable from those latest moves.  Right this together last week, the VIX was hovering in the mid-20s.  That seemed low but not outside the realm, and then subsequently the VIX moved down to 18 against nothing that even hear-there wasn't even chatter about solace over the Greek was delusion in the reports.  They seemed to be negative scenarios, but not showing up in the VIX.  All I can say is it's not the first time. as to get color on what investors are thinking in the tails.  But the VIX what's trading in the 18s, more of those things look at the liquidity seem to be getting overall stock price index tension here, and at this point, I don't really take much solace now it's in the puzzle bucket as opposed to having relieved some tension, but we will just have to keep an eye on it.

your presentation.  Nellie, did comment? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Thank you for you have a pointed out, it seems before the LTROs or the ECB was willing to demonstrate that they were willing to take you can see there, there was both upside risk and downside risk. MS. LIANG.  I just wanted to add one point to that.  One of the issues we have raised was the current level of downside risk versus, say, last October.  And as we as if action, there was a little more uncertainty in the markets.  However, these options prices were just volatile, and, as

June 19-20, 2012

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Right.

from the VIX.  But if LTROs, that may have been the reason for some of what seems to be a little bit I might mention is the banking credit for taking out anxiety about the banks It is not the answer to everything, but it did work through a European scenario.  At got sufficient capital to withstand what looks like a MS. LIANG.  So as Michael was saying, it is hard to read all of this you just think about the overall level, once the ECB demonstrated it was willing to take some steps, like the less anxiety in the U.S. financial markets.  The other piece system.  I think the CCAR might get some themselves. least for credit losses it appears they've pretty bad recession.

you go through the entire book it is hard to pinpoint big changes. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Those are very helpful interpretations.  I had mentioned the VIX, but if

MS. LIANG.  Absolutely.

I think those are very helpful interpretations.  Thank you. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  But to continue the CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  On this general topic we have an item now, which is called an opportunity to talk about financial stability issues, either discussion or to raise issues that didn't come up in discussion.  And I have President Rosengren.

exhibit 10 CDS with a list of firms.  I know I talked a little bit about this last time, but looking and Goldman I were asked what stress scenario that I would do if I were a risk manager at a large are quite elevated at this time.  In addition, they how much, and it might be coincident with MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My question emanates from on the 5-year at the broker-dealer CDS from the largest banks, particularly Morgan Stanley Sachs, if bank, it would be a Greek exit that's not as managed as Steve highlighted, combined with a run on Morgan Stanley whose credit default swaps are likely to be downgraded.  We do not know by

June 19-20, 2012

very large I have for you are:  How would you view the likelihood of that kind of the tail do you view it?  And if it were to occur, can the primary dealer focused?  You could offer it to everybody, but if only Morgan Stanley showed type of facilities? problems in Greece and Spain.  So you can easily tell a story where you start having a very serious disruption in wholesale credit that is very focused particularly on one institution.  The questions scenario?  How far out in credit facility be up, would that be a problem for how we have been instructed to do 13(3)

LIANG. Picking up where David and Steve were in terms of our Tealbook forecast, your forecast is, the exit you are Italy getting some support from some almost hesitate to say that.  It is a more we are considering not within the Tealbook forecast. MS. and in some sense probably where the central tendency of raising is a disorderly exit, not an exit that might be several months down the road and might have some backstops and might involve Spain and programs.  This one is clearly, in our view, less likely-I disruptive one, and one group that is considering a number of alternative you had something disorderly and you started to get runs on certain are working able to handle a and smoothly, which ones cannot, and what kinds of contingencies they That work is in early, early stages.  These are tough in the past, and they obviously do not have direct access to the is a little bit stricter than it used to be pre-Dodd-Frank, and as you just We have an internal staff working scenarios so that we can think through where the stresses are-the weak points, the operational choke points, so to speak-if institutions.  To get a sense of what the disruption to the system could be, we through various scenarios to help identify which institutions may be re-denomination quickly are planning for.  The idea would be to identify actions we could take now to mitigate the bad consequences if they were unexpected. scenarios, and we haven't thought through all of the consequences.

MR. ALVAREZ.  I appreciate the opportunity to talk at the FOMC meeting.  It doesn't happen very often for lawyers.  [Laughter]

is really much stricter now, and the difficulty we have is that while has to be broad based in its eligibility, it cannot be for the purpose of aiding a single firm.  We can certainly set up a PDCF in a way that is broad based in its eligibility, but I whether or not it really is for the purpose of aiding a particular firm.  I think a political risk.  There is no requirement that more than it, but clearly the Congress would be looking at how broad based the people come to the facility.  Indeed, the PDCF when we set it up the used the facility.  How it is viewed is going to and circumstances, and whether the scenario was bad enough that it is The 13(3) authority the facility failing think folks will be looking at the participation rate and the circumstances around setting up the facility in deciding that the risk is less a legal risk and more one person actually access access is and how many first time around had periods of time when only one firm went to the facility, though over a period of about nine months virtually all the firms depend a lot on the facts going to attract more than just one firm's attention.

Just a follow-up; the other way you can address that is to price the want to use it.  Even if it primarily is focused on a run at one firm, if it is you priced it very attractively so it is broad based? MR. ROSENGREN. facility so lots of people very attractively priced, presumably lots of firms might show up, and it might offset some of the stigma, in some sense somewhat like the TAF was priced attractively enough that even people that didn't necessarily need it would take advantage of it.  If more people showed up, would that address that concern?  How does that factor into the decision of whether or not

June 19-20, 2012

way so that it is broad based in its group would be able to come-all the primary dealers, for example-and we activation-something that we experienced somewhat I think we will experience more this time around. MR. ALVAREZ.  Clearly, we will design it in a eligibility so that a think that is a broad enough group.  The point is that there will be a lot more political scrutiny about the facilities immediately upon their in 2008, but

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.

vein that Eric was in, one in setting up a facility that is really attractive from a pricing perspective when there are the facility wind down automatically to exit? addition, it's not really the facility becoming a backstop that is crowding in private investors. you describe, but there when the facility is maybe a backstop.  It is keeping private investors in you could use. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Just to follow on in the problem not a lot of strains on the market is how then does In It is essentially pushing private investors out.  You could do it the way are some downsides to that.  Another alternative, of course, is to introduce the facility a little bit earlier, before the markets are really melting down and the firms are in distress, so that at least there is a period of time the game, and only if things deteriorate do people actually turn to the facility.  So there are two different models that issue, though, of Morgan Stanley and the Moody's downgrade is very, very relevant could intersect with the deterioration and events in Europe, and the good news is Morgan Stanley has good things over the past few years; it has lot more capital and a much bigger credit rating downgrade, if it gets the full three-notch downgrade, could just its near-term liquidity resources, but also how people perceive it as The to the outlook because it broker-dealers in particular are very vulnerable because they don't really have a secure lender of last resort, and they depend on wholesale funding.  Now, the done a lot of liquidity buffer.  But the definitely undermine not

to this, but it could be If so, then the II OLA.  That is completely not clear that that would work on a cross-border basis.  You still you to wind down the firm in a more orderly a real risk from a financial stability perspective. a viable firm from a trading perspective.  We don't really know the answer that a P2 short-term rated major broker-dealer actually cannot be successful in this space, and so it may call into question the broader viability of the firm in its current form. question is, well, how does the firm shrink?  One way is Title untested, and, in my mind, it is might want to have some sort of facility that allows way.  But it is definitely wanted to turn to Europe a little bit and develop the implications a bit further.  I because of what it implies for U.S. GDP, but lead to a tremendous amount of disruption from a financial stability I think the staff is broadly in the right place in terms of how they're thinking about I would like to highlight is why I see this as bad dynamics.  The first bad dynamic is that the fiscal austerity measures that they It also erodes maintaining the program.  As a result, you don't get the fiscal outcomes you're shooting for, and political support for further fiscal austerity melts away.  The second claims are viewed as claims, which increases the incentive for the private-sector investors to I think that this is why the market took the re-capitalization program in the as a negative; they said, 'Oh, God, we're starting the subordination I also really do think this is the key issue, and not just also because it could perspective. this.  The problems go far beyond Greece, and what likely to get worse as opposed to get better.  From my perspective, the Europeans are caught in a series of very are undertaking lead to poor economic performance, which leads to slippage in terms of the budget outcomes, which in turn increases the questions about fiscal sustainability. the political support for that bad dynamic is that the private claims are increasingly being replaced by public claims, and when this happens, the way they have set it up, the remaining private subordinate to the public withdraw further. case of the Spanish banks

June 19-20, 2012

As people view their claims as becoming subordinate, the countries then quickly lose which we have sort of started seeing in the case of Spain where 10-year standard climbed to around 7 percent.  The third bad dynamic-and this is probably is receiving a bit less attention-is that as the countries lose market access, the falls on those who are left.  There has been a presumption all along that, a tremendous amount of fiscal resources.  But as the smaller and smaller and the claims on the center get bigger and bigger, there is some process.' market access, sovereign yields have the one that burden increasingly well, Germany is big and strong and has center gets question about whether the center actually is viable as well.

widely recognize is that you countries to give up their regulation of their banking systems.  Moreover, it of the euro area.  Right now they're taking on the point of view of the general electorate. How do you escape all of these bad dynamics?  What people need a broad leap to much greater political and fiscal integration, but the problem is there is no stomach for that politically at this point because it would require sovereignty in terms of their budgets and the would require the core countries, such as Germany, to be explicit to their populations about the fiscal burden that they have to take on for the rest the burden, but it's not really explicit from what stops these poor dynamics from continuing. and pan-European you you did it, you have to do it in a very particular way re-denominations.  You could have a deposit insurance scheme your deposits are insured, but in terms of what?  'Am I going to get back euros, I going to get some other currency?' In absence of relief, I don't really see Some people have talked about a pan-European deposit insurance regime bank supervision as a possible means of slowing down the dynamic, but it is not clear how bring those into play quickly.  And, even if to eliminate the risk of currency in which all of or am

on two other issues that I don't think have received sufficient core country finances are already deeply entwined with the rest of liquidity facilities, through the Emergency Liquidity Assistance give you some recent figures. May, figures, and where we are today is quite a bit bigger than this.  The refinancing operations, and €106 billion through the Liquidity Assistance programs.  For Germany, the size of these balances doesn't Bundesbank had TARGET2 claims of €699 was a problem, these claims are supposed to be parceled out across GDP, but it's not even clear that that would happen in extremis. I just want to touch briefly attention.  The first is that Europe through the ECB lending, which is called ELA, or through the EFSF.  Let me just These are dated, largely figures show €395 billion have been committed to the periphery via the EU and the EFSF. Commercial banks in the periphery have borrowed €932 billion through their national banks, €826 billion through the standard ECB Emergency match up directly with these other numbers, but is evident in TARGET2, which is the EU payments and settlement system.  As of May, the billion, and that number is going up.  Now, they don't have full responsibility for that €699 billion.  If there actually Europe based on their share of the situation worsens, these claims, of course, just continue to increase, and when deposits flee out of the periphery. facilities.  Then when the eligible collateral runs out, they turn to claims from So you ask yourselves the it end?  Now, in principle, the ECB could any euros to hand to their depositors.  You would probably have massive Second, as one of the important channels is via the banking system As this occurs, banks first take their unencumbered collateral to their national banks who participate in the ECB liquidity the ELA facilities, and these borrowings through the ELA are essentially unsecured the national bank funded by increases in TARGET2 imbalances. question:  How long can this go on, and how does bring this all to an end, at some point, by refusing to sanction further ELA lending, and then the banks wouldn't have

June 19-20, 2012

going, the ELA lending increases, and the implicit burden on the core bank runs, and the whole system would shut down.  But it's difficult for the ECB, which is one of the true pan-European institutions, to pull the plug.  If they don't pull the plug, then the process just keeps countries increases.

I try to be optimistic, but the only silver lining I see in any of this is that countries now are really deeply implicated already, and if the situation deteriorates, their increase further.  You may be past the point where they have no choice that the longer this and the bigger the core claims become.  There are two get to 'yes' on fiscal union, could decide that it is still better to cut their losses.  And, the thing that I worry about is that, good in We are not at that point, but you could imagine if you run this down the going to start to question the fiscal ability of Europe to I look at this, and the core exposures are going to but to go all in to save the project, as opposed to the alternative of throwing the peripheral countries out and trying to limit their losses.  Now, a darker view would be goes on, the more deposits flow out difficulties in that scenario.  First, if the core countries are unable to they second, market participants might believe that at some point the core itself isn't money terms of all the claims. road that, at some point, people are handle all of this.

want to end on an optimistic note.  We did have some pretty interesting events in 2008, I, but we didn't was going to be a Maiden Lane II.  And those were the last really huge bouts of that Maiden Lane II was paid off earlier this year and that Maiden Lane III were paid off over the intermeeting period.  We still have a going to lose no money on any of those special going to make a reasonable profit for the taxpayer. I 2009, and they led to Maiden Lane.  We should have called it Maiden Lane know there financial instability.  The good news is Maiden Lane and few assets left to sell, but the Federal Reserve is interventions.  We are actually

June 19-20, 2012

is that if you buy assets when illiquidity risk premiums are the ability to hold those assets until the illiquidity risk premiums have can actually performed a lot worse than we thought it would when we we illiquidity risk premium shrank dramatically.  I don't want to do this we're going to make a decent profit to the taxpayer.  And I just want to Investment Support office and the people here these loans paid off. I think one lesson in this really high and you have narrowed-even if the underlying loss performance of the assets is terrible-the situation work out.  The economy acquired those assets, but the assets actually outperformed relative to the prices at which bought them because the again.  Given all the scrutiny the Federal Reserve got about these special facilities, it's really a good story for the Federal Reserve that we managed down these facilities, that the loans were completely repaid, and thank all the people at the New York Fed and the at the Board who helped us work through this problem and get

By the way, Mr. Chairman, Vice Chairman Dudley, at a Conference of Presidents meeting money off these.'  No one believed him.  Now he want to come back very quickly to U.S. asset valuations on junk bonds because, as you healthy issuance in the early part of the year has dried up, and the comfort myself in the fact that as that if you're high quality or just an A-rated investment five-year money at an all-in cost of around 1½ percent or seven-year attractive.  Should we worry about this widening in Is it signaling something, or is it just that basically investment grade credits have been and are much more attractive to finance?  I think we're outside of I showed in your charts, the spreads have widened.

the historical norm in terms of the width of that spread, and I'm just wondering what signals you're picking up from that.

One thing about the issuance, first.  Because a lot of this gross credit much smaller.  Even in February and March when the high yield bonds were at these strong paces, a lot of that was for retiring existing debt.  The gross numbers give us a sense of investor appetite as much as for companies adding debt to grossly overstate how much debt is being added to the balance sheet. I believe that the overall positions of net corporations, across size spectra and across also below their historical norms.  And as you probably know, the default rates are actually quite moderate, especially given the state of I would think about the spreads is that there is a and that is evident in given the levels of relative to the lowest Treasury yields that we have ever seen.  I think it in a way that is lowering debt burdens for most firms that are in the some investor portfolios. MR.

We haven't gotten to a stage that has us tremendously concerned, but we ask the questions and try and come back in CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Why don't we break for coffee 20 minutes?

[Coffee break]

Lacker. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Welcome back.  We're ready for our economic go-round, and we'll start with President employment report may have gotten the also seems to point to a noticeable slowdown in first quarter peak.  Manufacturing, exports, and business investment have all lost year.  Tracking estimates of growth have been pulled down, and forecasters are marking down the year as well.  I've marked down my forecast, too.  I wrote year as a whole, and that's pretty close to the average MR. LACKER.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  The economic outlook has clearly weakened since our April meeting.  The May most attention, but an array of other indicators economic growth.  Retail sales ex autos and gas have been flat for two months.  Auto sales have come off their some of the forward momentum they were showing last current-quarter GDP projections for the remainder of the down 2.0 percent real GDP growth for this private forecaster.

adverse scenarios are good job of thinking through a lot of them and filling good one.  I don't have much to add The continued turmoil in Europe is obviously front and center as a macroeconomic concern for us.  One should never be too sanguine, and a variety of possible.  I think the staff has done a really us in.  I thought we had a very rich discussion and a very

June 19-20, 2012

is in thinking about United States, the way I like to go about it is to separate the real from the financial contagion.  They are obviously related at some level, but as an sense is that the most outcome is that the real U.S. fallout will be mostly limited to the direct trade effects, and I think those are well captured in what the Tealbook that's informative about that.  I'll just make two or three observations.  One the effect of Europe on the spending flows initial matter, just separate the two and try to think these through.  And my likely those could be modest or substantial, but quantifies, and so that gives me a little bit of heart.

is right to highlight some serious was fluctuations in inferences about what policymakers are going to do next or are going financial market volatility or that kind of contagion are potentially pretty limited for the explain the puzzle that President Kocherlakota talked about-the As for financial contagion, I think the staff vulnerabilities, particularly in the money fund complex.  I thought Vice Chairman Dudley's discussion of all the ins and outs of policy over there and the ways that might evolve excellent.  Financial contagion in Europe seems to be driven by the things he was talking about-by to be willing to do in the next country.  Now, because of that, I think the implications for that type of United States, and this may somewhat limited extent to which volatility has risen in the United States.

back to the United Sates and our District, until the past couple of weeks the tone Turning of the anecdotal reports has been somewhat at odds with the weakening macroeconomic data

Beige Book contacts painted a similar picture.  Our most recent opportunity from our District was last week's meeting of the combined Bank and our two Branches.  This meeting did have a noticeably softer tone that characterize it as a mixed set of reports with reports had to do with looming cutbacks in defense spending, and that is a is especially relevant around the District of Columbia region here.

The preliminary figures reading of negative 5.  This is the third time this index has dipped to around zero in this recovery; it was a bit above zero last month.  The services sector, experienced a step-up in activity in June, and the employment indexes in both surveys relatively positive.

I said, our most current anecdotal reports are mixed rather than uniformly consistent with an economy that has slowed and faces some headwinds, price increases, which are being employment growth even at a subdued pace should help bolster household rate we saw last year, but 4 to 5 percent that many, including the Tealbook, are grown more rapidly than the economy as a growth.  I do think a case can be made Overall, as gloomy.  I read them as but where there do remain some sources of underlying strength.  Household spending has been all the more remarkable, given the downward revision in disposable income.  Part of the hit to real disposable income in recent quarters stemmed from energy reversed.  The resulting boost to real income will support consumption in the short run.  Over the medium term, further income and spending.  Equipment and software investment probably won't grow at the 8-plus percent forecasting is not too shabby.  Exports, too, have whole over the past two years and are likely to slow, but still export growth above 3½ percent, as in the Tealbook, would contribute meaningfully to overall

The inflation outlook has certainly changed somewhat due to the unexpectedly large decline in energy and other commodity prices.

However, even this that would undoubtedly spill over to the enlightened self-interest in Europe and seems consistent with the results from election.  Nonetheless, this assumption is becoming harder to maintain.  In discussions with Europeans since our previous meeting, I have been struck by the hardening of their positions and the view that it was not whether but when Greece would not be able to satisfy the continued aid.  This is in sharp contrast to views being Despite their increasing resignation about Greece's likely failure, few Europeans seemed confident that effective firewalls

The results of these conversations suggest some amount of disconnect between how from our business contacts remain mostly positive and suggestive of an economy that is still improving, if detected no remains a mixed picture.

Europe are likely to be small for the United States, but it's the financial risks that loom large. The businesses are reading newspapers every day about the impending implosion of Europe and about our own fiscal cliff.  Can we really with that type of uncertainty looming?  Do we think that another few basis points on longer-term rates will suddenly spend and invest?  I doubt it, but these near-term downside risks also suggest some upside risks

Many respondents commented on the increased uncertainty, making it difficult for them or their has hurt some of our manufacturers who service the oil drilling industry.

In 2008 and 2009, at the end of the recession, the rate was 9.5 percent; three years later, it's 8.2 percent.  I attribute part of this aggressive action on the part of this Committee.

And the second note about my District that is of concern is that our real 3.4 percent in April and May.  We are the leading export state by a (excluding Mexico) and China-the So the situation within the 11th District is somewhat weaker than it was before, According to my District, our job growth has slowed.

I spoke with 43 CEOs outside of my District in directors.  And I just want to give you a quick summary there because it Lockhart was saying, the situation seemed in a short period of time, but there is a disconnect or some cacophony you hear from your business operators and what you see in the broader data.  I you know, to start with the rails and the ships and the way things move.  In terms of rail If you take out the coal drag, you would have in April and May growth in rail freight delivery.

A number of people around this I found it helpful in terms of the next two current thinking about policy in a forecast-based approach.

Between these two approaches, rules as a benchmark by table have made compelling arguments in favor of that approach, and the Chairman, in fact, noted many of them in his 2004 remarks.  Nonetheless, go-rounds to frame my my remarks will be based on my current modal forecast. before in these meetings, stance in response to information that suggests a need to change that modal forecast.  And as will hear from what a reason to change my views.  But for today, as you to know that appropriate policy

yet again reduced its estimate of potential GDP, I still see the output gap in the economy as amount of slack will generate inflation above 2 percent in the next two to numerically in the SEP.  The core of my explanation is twofold.  First, even though the Tealbook has being less negative than is reflected in Tealbook estimates.  Given the Committee's planned policy path, the low three years.  Second, because there is less slack, we can reduce future inflation back down to 2 percent with relatively little consequence for the unemployment rate.

The behavior of prices continues to play a key role would put downward pressure on prices and give rise to inflation percent.  Some observers have argued that one reason we are not seeing that is and other kinds of anchoring effects in price-setting.  But, of course, we found that very and the Committee rightly responded with the second LSAP.  But since additional evidence that supports my view about the output gap.  Average affect my outlook?  I FOMC statement, inflation will steadily rise would expect that core inflation will be around 2½ percent.  Given Let me start with the first part.  Why do I believe the output gap is less negative than the Tealbook?  I have been through this before: in my thinking.  A highly negative output gap represents a large excess of supply relative to demand.  Such an excess running below its long-run trend, a long-run trend that hopefully is being determined by our target of 2 because of sticky wages actually did see this downward pressure on inflation in the second half of 2010.  I persuasive at the time, that time, core inflation has risen back to 2 percent.  While this behavior in inflation is quite informative, there is hours worked per week is now above its level in the fourth quarter of 2007, and the rate of capacity utilization is near its late 2007 levels.  All of this pushes me in the direction of thinking that the output gap is less negative than in the Tealbook.  How does that project that under the policy path described in the above our target.  By 2015, I

June 19-20, 2012

than what is described in the April FOMC statement future inflation back to our publicly stated target. this outlook, a less accommodative policy would be desirable because it would reduce that reduced inflation in, say, 2013 to 2014, by 25 basis a good entrée into that literature.  The idea in this literature is that once most a limited economy is close to capacity, then reducing monetary policy a small change in unemployment.  As I have argued, I see the close to its capacity constraints.  And given that we are so close to constraints, I see reduction of accommodation that results in a 25 basis point fall in years as having little impact on unemployment. Suppose we followed a policy points.  What would happen then to unemployment, to the other side of the dual mandate?  My thinking on this is shaped by the literature on nonlinear Phillips curves-and here I spent my time reading Governor Yellen's very nice presidential address to the Western Economics Association, which was the economy is close to capacity, adding monetary accommodation can have at impact on output and so on employment.  That's what it means to be close to capacity.  The converse is that if the accommodation will result in only economy as being relatively capacity inflation over the next couple of

I currently favor a less accommodative policy than that preferred by am one of the three that favor an interest rate increase by the end of 2012.  I 2.1 percent in 2013 All told, this is why the Tealbook.  I anticipate that my version of appropriate policy will lead to inflation being and 2.2 percent in 2014, instead of the higher inflation that would result from the FOMC statement's path.  That is a forecast-based version of my approach to policy and the outlook that is in my SEP submission.

going to close by switching gears and offering some reflection of about my objection function with respect to unemployment and I have said, the projection that I submitted to the SEP includes a forecast that Mr. Chairman, I am what my SEP submission says inflation.  As

June 19-20, 2012

am the only one of monetary policy that in 2014.  It is important to emphasize that this projection of above-target As we all know and I have said several times already, my projection about 2014 inflation is based on the In formulating that I knew that the Committee had tools available-raising rates even more today, forecast of 2.2 percent. clear that I am willing to tolerate-and 'tolerate' is really the wrong word.  I headline inflation and core inflation will be above 2 percent in 2014.  I think I the 19 participants who submitted a forecast for inflation under appropriate had it above 2 percent inflation is not related to my perspective that there is relatively little slack. as assumption that the Committee is following what I view as optimal policy. optimal policy, for example-that would serve to bring inflation in 2014 down below my My SEP submission tells the rest of the Committee that I see it as inappropriate to use those tools.  Instead, my submission communicates to other participants, and rather indirectly to the public, valuable information about my loss function over inflation and unemployment.  In particular, it makes believe it is optimal to follow policies that will lead to inflation above 2 percent in order to bring unemployment down somewhat faster.  I see such an objective function as entirely in keeping with the consensus framework statement that we released in January.

remarks echo those that I made in our discussion of consensus forecasts. to a forecast horizon goals of what I think these Each of our individual SEP submissions is based on the assumption that the Committee is following what that individual views as appropriate policy.  Once we get that is outside the lags associated with monetary policy, our submissions become ways to communicate with each other and with the public about what we believe to be the we consider to be appropriate policy.  It follows that there is valuable information in our SEP submissions about our loss functions over inflation and unemployment.  I found that information

As I mentioned during the question and answer, I just can't bring myself to put high inflation I think it would be misinterpreted given the way we are I think that it would be very useful to somehow address that, and I MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would like to say that President Kocherlakota's comments about the SEPs are potentially very important.  Using those to somehow communicate amongst ourselves would be very helpful, but, in fact, I don't think we are able to do that, because we don't identify our somebody forward an appropriate monetary policy assumption that would lead to a very forecast in the SEP just because currently reporting those. very much agree with Narayana on that.

find the constellation of risks that we face today to be truly frightening.  The good job in conveying these risks-the European crisis, the fiscal cliff, and a contacts.  Given all of this, when I put together my write down anything meaningfully stronger economic growth over the next 24 months.  Frankly, my current outlook of 2 percent contains too much hope relative to the expected outcomes for Europe and the U.S. My long-standing concerns have not changed materially.  Resource slack continues to be unacceptably high, and inflation indicators point to undershooting our longer-run target.  In my opinion, the Committee's modestly optimistic April SEP outlook now seems severely challenged.  I Tealbook did a hard landing in China.  All of these scenarios came up one way or another repeatedly in my conversations with directors and other forecast this round, I couldn't in good conscience than the Tealbook projection.  Previously, I had been a bit more optimistic, assuming 2½ to 3 percent probably

June 19-20, 2012

a recession over the next four 30 years, is probably around 20 percent.  The recession odds be over 40 percent.  Accordingly, I think the risks are still skewed to the downside, monetary accommodation is essential to provide a buffer as possible against the downside risks to the outlook. fiscal policy debate.  The Tealbook says the probability of quarters, based on the forecast errors over the past historical average must understate the potential shocks we face now.  Today's could frankly and I now believe even more strongly that more as strong highlighted all of these risks that we and yet, but all were highly concerned about the outlook, and the degree of uniformity in of the worries centered on international was very thick.  Although they were unhappy Landing in China' scenario.  A prominent heavy equipment manufacturer 'dying on the vine.'  Inventories were piling up, and factory production talking directly with the Chinese officials, and they were basically to offset poor corporate performance My conversations with business contacts uniformly are facing.  Keeping in mind how modest our outlook for 2012 has been, many directors CEOs reported that U.S. economic growth was softening.  To be sure, they were not seeing large declines their worries was striking.  Not surprisingly, a lot developments, and the irony of the commentary with the U.S. softening, CEOs of corporations with a global footprint said their U.S. activity was practically a beacon of optimism compared with other global markets.  U.S. performance easily exceeded Europe, China, and emerging market economies.  Let me just cite one example that reinforces the 'Hard described China as would be seriously curtailed unless new, promised stimulus programs took effect soon.  He is large enough that he was guaranteeing him that within 90 days the stimulus policies would be taking strong effect.  Some global corporations also will likely see real knock-on implications for their U.S. operations, even apart from direct trade linkages.  For instance, in order abroad, one of my directors with a broad client base noted that many corporations were planning

I spoke with expects the Congress to elections, and the implications could be huge.  For Manufacturers' estimates that defense will intensify, further restraining hiring and mentioned that already.  And with that, the likelihood of a robust worries reports of lower prices for energy and steel. As for the domestic fiscal cliff situation, no one address the fiscal cliff before the November example, two CEOs cited National Association of spending sequestration would lead to 1 million fewer jobs.  Moreover, no one is betting on a clean resolution of the fiscal situation soon after the election.  The bottom line is this:  There are tons of downside risks to the U.S. economy, and businesses are highly attuned to them.  As each month passes without resolution, this uncertainty investment.  Others have business expansion will fade even more.  With regard to inflation, no one expressed any that inflation was going to be higher.  There is no measurable pressure from wages, and there were many role of structural factors in limiting the contacts in the employment services industry, and I am fortunate enough the Manpower and Kelly Services CEOs on my Chicago and Detroit boards.  First, they are.  For engineers were often It's a small niche, and shortages This brings me to our recurring debate over the recovery and risking higher wages and inflation.  For quite some time, I have been skeptical of arguments that place a lot of weight on reported skill shortages and high vacancy-to-hire ratesthese are used to argue that labor market slack is significantly less than indicated by the 8.2 percent unemployment rate.  So I spent additional face-to-face time this round discussing these questions with my to have told me that reports of skill shortages often sound much broader than they really example, one of them noted that general statements about a generic lack of really references to a more specific lack of petroleum engineers.

And another overstated example refers to shortages of existed even before the recession. exceedingly picky these days; they both said that because demand is low, firms matches.  Firms post vacancies for high-skill positions and then kick out huge numbers of applications on the basis of tiny deviations from skill and experience descriptions.  They will only take perfect matches.  They the moment.  These are desired hires.  They are not essential ones, they said.

I also heard that employers were trying to stockpile talent for the future, again, high-skill workers so that they will have them available when the time willing to pay for that.  Also, these employment a high-skill job, but then post that vacancy over and data.  Various experts suspected that this probably didn't affect the numbers you worry.

Apparently, they are firms often get a small number of orders for over again with different subsidiaries within their firm and with slightly different job descriptions and keywords for skills.

As economists who are strongly sympathetic to assuming markets Manpower and Kelly directors indicated, these types of reports are economic downturns with sluggish recoveries.  Whenever demand really picks up, find acceptable pools of workers to 'fakancies.'  [Laughter]  That is, fake vacancies-openings fill.  Our industry contacts seemed to agree with that assessment.  Our speculation that labor shortage reports are overstated is also consistent with the fact that for a lack of skilled labor, employers allegedly scarce function well to address imbalances, this has to make us suspicious of stories of widespread skill shortages.  As both my typical during these firms will stop being so picky, and they will magically fill their actual vacancies.

I now expect year, with only a moderate pickup in growth in 2013 and 2014.  The downward revisions are disappointing, but in a broader perspective the pace of recovery still looks to be about where was expecting it to be in January.  There have been no incoming data so negative that the medium-term recovery will be significantly Tealbook has taken the recent economic data on U.S. financial markets as reason to make larger outlook than I have made.  It has been difficult to decide how to incorporate the European financial stress and the weaker sector forecasters participating in the the Tealbook.

Finally, continued positive signs in job openings months suggest the potential for some recovery in employment and headline PCE inflation months, the median trimmed mean have been running very close to 2 percent, which is consistent with a little softer near-term core inflation data, much softer growth in GDP, and the associated weaker growth in labor costs.  There is currently expect, The latest reading of Turning to inflation, I have nudged my forecast for both core down a little since April, roughly in line with my January projections.  I now project inflation to run a bit below but still close to our longer-run target.  Over the past three CPI and the core PCE inflation running a bit below 2 percent.  The key factors behind the downward revisions to my outlook for inflation are energy prices, weaker the potential for the weakness in the economy to create more disinflation than I and lower inflation could be reinforced if inflation expectations dip over the medium term.  The Cleveland model of expected inflation, which adjusts for the inflation risk premium, continues to show inflation expectations significantly below our target rate of inflation. our model for 10-year inflation expectations is about 1.2 percent.  This represents a decline of nearly 30 basis points since March.

The Cleveland a reading off of TIPS, for example, real rate at minus 58 basis points.  In this environment, the Cleveland model Estimating inflation expectations these days in a world of extremely low nominal Treasury current model suggests that the real rate is just above zero, while puts the 10-year may be underestimating inflation expectations a little because the model treats the unprecedented decline in real interest rates as unlikely.  So it attributes more of the decline in real rates to

For example, even if unadjusted, inflation expectations rates from TIPS and from inflation swaps have dropped since late March by as much or more than the Cleveland model suggests.  My staff inflation expectations looks to be a developing risk.

April, the risks to economic activity now seem to be surrounding the outlook.  A severe recession in additional financial stress that the recession could cause would significantly slow scheduled tax and changes associated with the fiscal cliff also pose a significant risk of a dramatic economy.  For inflation, uncertainty remains higher than normal, and I see the In summary, compared with primarily to the downside, with more uncertainty Europe and the growth and raise unemployment in the United States.  Of course, all of the spending slowing of the risks as now tilted to the downside.

Our have proven tenacious, and economic growth has been persistently One way to illustrate the would expand at an average annual rate of just over 3 percent from 2010 through 2014. growth in 2011 and early 2012 has turned out to be much weaker than expected, The Tealbook forecast and our SEP forecasts exhibit a similar pattern.  For example, FOMC central tendency for GDP growth in 2012 was 3½ to 4½ percent. for 2012 now stands at just 1.9 to 2.4 percent.  Similarly, our 2013 growth in November 2010 to 2.2 to 2.8 percent Governor Tarullo has repeatedly emphasized that the U.S. economy has never really gotten out of the mud since the financial crisis, and I medium-term forecasts have consistently envisioned a strengthening recovery powered by the healing of past imbalances, improved confidence, and the impetus of a highly accommodative monetary policy.  But such virtuous circle dynamics have been more hope than reality.  Instead, the headwinds to recovery slower than either the FOMC or private forecasters anticipated. magnitude of the disappointment is to compare Blue Chip forecasts for real GDP growth made two years ago with those made more recently.  In early 2010, private forecasters anticipated that real GDP However, actual and private forecasters now anticipate only a modest acceleration in real activity over the next few years. in January 2010, the The central tendency forecast has been revised down from 3½ to 4½ percent this round.

This is a substantial departure from normal cyclical dynamics.  Indeed, I now demand is likely to remain relatively weak throughout the remainder of equilibrium real federal funds rate Both my by my view that the slower global next several anticipate that aggregate the decade.  An implication, in my view, is that the economy's

I am interpreting run here as 7 to 10 years. is now probably estimate of the longer-run nominal federal funds rate to 3 percent-you will be able to identify that I am longer example, the Blue Chip consensus forecast released in March-and that was weak data and downward revisions to economic growth-showed the bill rate settling down at only 1¼ percent late in the decade.  That is before the recession.  In addition, our yield curve model currently estimates that the expected nominal short rate at 3.07 percent, well below the staff's 4¼ percent assumed equilibrium Because survey evidence suggests that longer-term inflation expectations remain at 2 percent, that staff estimate of the far forward nominal short rate implies that ahead is about 1 percent.  Moreover, the one-year forward Of course, the intercepts in Taylor-type policy rules are supposed to approximate some time to come. My estimate of the equilibrium real rate seems consistent with financial market indicators.  For before the recent rash of real three-month Treasury down 120 basis points from the long-run projections made staff's three-factor 10 years ahead stands nominal rate. firmly anchored the expected real short rate 10 years TIPS rate 10 years ahead is currently only 0.7 percent, far below its historical norm of 2¼ percent. the equilibrium real short rate.  A failure to fully adjust for this decline would leave the prescriptions of Taylor-type rules significantly too restrictive now and for

consistent pattern of upward revisions.  One possible explanation is that slope of the Phillips curve turned out to be too high, and labor market slack Turning to inflation, I think it is interesting that the Tealbook inflation forecasts for 2011, 2012, and 2013 reveal a staff estimates of the has been exerting less downward pressure on inflation than staff had anticipated.  Of course, an alternative interpretation-and it's the interpretation that President Kocherlakota just

face of high unemployment in recent years I In this regard, I think it is worth noting mirrors that in other countries that have had large output gaps for a common finding is that once inflation falls to low levels it tends to In other words, in low inflation environments, inflation is notably less responsive to from labor market slack than when inflation is elevated.  That is, the shortarticulated-is that the stability of inflation in the constitutes evidence that much of the remaining unemployment is structural and not cyclical. would like to articulate the other side of this argument. that the U.S. experience prolonged period.  The stabilize. downward pressure run Phillips curve appears to flatten out at low inflation rates.

Bill Wascher and his Board colleagues looks at the distribution that during the high percentage of workers saw no change in firms that might ideally have cut wages instead A second study by Mary Daly and Bart Hobijn at the San Francisco Fed Current Population Survey.  These results wages.  In the absence of this barrier, nominal gains in wages and unit yet lower rate. One important reason for such nonlinearity, as President Kocherlakota noted, is downward nominal wage rigidity-that is, the reluctance or inability of many firms to cut nominal wages.  And this is a phenomenon that two recent studies suggest is currently at work in the United States.  One study by of nominal wage changes for individual jobs based on ECI data.  They document depth of the current labor market slump a relatively their nominal wage, and relatively few experienced modest wage cuts.  In other words, the wage change distribution shows a pile-up phenomenon at zero, and missing mass in the negative portion of the distribution, suggesting that many left them unchanged. found the same pattern in individual data from the suggest that even when the unemployment rate was around 10 percent, many firms were reluctant to cut nominal labor costs would have likely been even more subdued given the severity of the economic downturn, with the result that inflation would probably now be running at a

June 19-20, 2012

slack due to a shortfall of aggregate demand Importantly, downward nominal wage rigidity is completely consistent with the view that today's high unemployment reflects labor market and not an increase in structural unemployment.

economic growth and only very gradual around that outlook is due to downside risks.  Even in normal times, cliff, the possibility of a hard landing in China, not to consequences for the U.S. economy, but it is not hard to imagine that several such events I will reiterate in tomorrow's policy goremain prepared to take further actions as warranted over coming In summary, my modal outlook involves slow progress in lowering unemployment toward normal levels, even with additional monetary policy accommodation.  I also envision inflation remaining in the vicinity of 2 percent.  Unfortunately, the bulk of the uncertainty the nearly uniform negative readings on the domestic economy would be unsettling.  However, as illustrated in the Tealbook alternative scenarios, we are also facing a number of other distinct risks, including the approaching fiscal mention potential spillovers from Europe.  Each of those scenarios would have significant adverse could converge into a so-called perfect storm.  Thus, as round, we should certainly months.

I still autos, but the baseline already includes a steady increase in I've been looking for seems I believe there is pent-up demand for auto sales.  And while the bottoming in house prices that increasingly more likely, this, too, is already incorporated into the baseline.  As always, I looked

recovery scenario, but it was just too big a leap for even my optimistic nature, that it does still offer a glimpse of the strength that could show through if that even this level of growth can be expected in the face of at the faster although I will say fiscal issues here and abroad could finally and miraculously be resolved.  The growth rate that I'm left with in my forecast is disappointing for sure, but given that I am still a glass-half-full kind of gal, I think it does indicate that there's some growing sturdiness in the recovery of the household and business sectors increasingly weak assumptions about the government and external sectors.

Within the boundaries of acceptable credit quality, admit that what loan getting comes at the expense of other lenders.  These data offer little evidence of at low rates will be realized by households and businesses over quite a long rates have probably provided support for real estate prices and are responsible for the stabilization of demand. Credit standards remain quite tight for all types of credit, but it seems to be primarily due to an aversion to taking on credit risk rather than liquidity or capital Indeed, by every measure, capital levels inflows, banks have steadily reduced deposit rates and reliance on wholesale deposit and nondeposit funding, which indicates to me that banks actually have they competition for new loans is reportedly quite fierce, and most bankers growth they are higher-than-expected loan volumes as a result of our actions, but the benefits of refinancing longer-term debt time, and low long-term probably at historical lows.

I've listened to the first 14 participants points of difference are, and I have heard three, First is in the basic frame of going and how strong the going, how far do we have to go of the downside risks not only in terms of their but also in terms of the level of negative effect were the full negative risk to I want to say a few things about each of those three, and because many people have good points, I will try to incorporate a bunch of them by reference. MR. TARULLO.  Thank today in an effort to identify where our important with the differences more important in two than in the third. reference that we've got-the narrative as to where the economy is underlying momentum of the economy is or would be absent the big downside risks.  Second is the issue of the output gap, that is, regardless of how fast we're to get there?  And third is the relative seriousness current effects materialize. already made many referred to the less-than-elegant metaphor that I've been deploying for a couple of years I thought we were basically in the mud and hit occasional stretches of dry pavement going well and hitting occasional soft patches.  Early this year, I thought at a point where things would be different because a considerable amount of in working off problems on balance sheets, both households and I said in the previous meeting, I think First, with respect to the basic frame or the strength of the underlying economy, Janet has already now-that rather than basically that we might be progress had been made financial institutions, and that still may be the case.  But as that there are some reasons to doubt how strong the underlying momentum would be even in the

June 19-20, 2012

I think it probably has-bottomed and is starting to recover, GDP, which is half the level it was fairly significant percentage increases in that going to produce the kind of huge boost in the economy that we might have seen growth, but I think attribute that to households' not changing their spending went up substantially.  Looking at the data on and other nonfuel purchases seems to back that as gasoline prices go down, we won't actually get a pattern of nonfuel and just be spending less on fuel and have their saving rates revert to where they were that although maybe we're not stuck in quite been for the past couple of years, and unlike the past couple of years I think you could explain the early-year bursts based on the impact of some combination and fiscal policy measures, it still does not feel as though there's a lot of absence of these big downside risks, and I would just mention a couple of additional factors now. One, even if housing has-as residential investment is now only about 2½ percent of real pre-bubble, not pre-crisis but pre-bubble.  Even activity are not with similar percentage increases four or five years ago.  Second, with respect to personal consumption expenditures, household balance sheets are definitely in better shape, but people do need income for spending to increase on an ongoing basis.  I know that we are a bit surprised by the level of spending in the face of fairly unimpressive personal income there's at least some chance that we can habits on nonfuel items, even as fuel prices purchases of things like clothing and automobiles up.  If that's the case though, it may be that burst in consumption expenditures because people may just keep the basic spending before the gasoline price run-up.  My own view is as much mud as we have where of particular monetary underlying momentum that would get us moving very quickly.

second important point of difference, how far is it that we I would say this may be the single most important issue that is susceptible to a good That leads, of course, to our have to go? back-and-forth that relies on data and more or less technical arguments.  We saw the beginnings,

June 19-20, 2012

the beginnings, of that today with Narayana's framing of the issue, and work to help us think that through.  It seems to me that's the kind of a consensus a very important difference in people's views as to policy measures.  It comes as no surprise that am much more aligned with Charlie, John, and Janet, but that debate is important, and the I'm sure there are others-need to be addressed, and people points have force for them. maybe a little more than then Charlie and John and particularly Janet giving a different perspective, citing both existing theoretical and empirical exchange that could productively be done, whether in the context of discussing forecast or otherwise, because it represents how much could be done with additional monetary I things that Narayana identifies-and need to understand whether and how much those would just add a couple of things to what others have said.  I see a problem in trying to any experienced recently.  I agree recessions of the 1970s and 1980s because the labor market has changed, but I disagree with Jim that the past two and in which most declines in employment were by attrition, which continued recession and then thereafter.  I think we've got to construct our own model, as it going on right now without the benefit of past precedents.  The other thing I you know, U-6 is one of the indicators I've been looking at the high by historical standards and, as has been the case consistently over years, the high level by historical standards is substantially attributable to the high reasons, which again is the antithesis of a I assess what has happened and project what will happen because we don't really have precedents for the kind of recession and unemployment that we've with Jim that it's not particularly useful to go back to the severe early recessions are a better indicator.  Those were very shallow recessions in which there were not large-scale layoffs during the were, of what's would add is, as 16 of the 18 of most.

Having said that, I actually real effect is having a substantial inhibiting effect on decisionmaking, certainly at the corporate level. I talk with CEOs of them talks about two things.  One is the degree the absence of an appetite that, not overwhelmingly, but substantially to that buttress that, even though it is really to dig into the data and find actual evidence that that's the case. The third point of difference that Europe and the fiscal cliff.  I've been in Washington on and off-mostly on, unfortunately-for 30 years now, and business people almost always uncertainty no matter think right now there is real force to those kinds of concerns, and that they're having a on decisions right now.  With respect to Europe, it does seem to me as though the situation already At the major financial institution level, there is no question about that.  As the big financial firms, almost every single one of to which they have de-risked or are trying to de-risk, and the second is for risk on the part of their clients.  They attribute Europe.  I think Jeff and Bill have both given anecdotes hard question of the effects if some of the bad scenarios in Europe crisis in the 1990s such a modest effect within the United States.  First that in the mid-1990s, with that fabulous economic team in the we were growing at a substantially higher rate than we are now, our It was just a very different economic What about, though, the develop?  I'm not so sanguine that what happened with the Asia financial would be repeated today-that we would see off, one important difference is White House, [laughter] economy was strong, and our deficit was declining.

Another important difference is, as and then in Latin America and Russia, confronted problems, operationally the ability to get a program together reasonably expeditiously and thenit, more or less, on a 'take it or pain as a environment, and of was not doing quite as each of the countries, first in Asia there was and I don't think there's a way around saying this-to present leave it' basis to the affected country, which invariably took it.

yesterday, one of the biggest problems with this crisis has get ahead of the problem, and to just do enough to keep That's why the halfnecessary to deal with those.  For that reason, I think that the uncertainty and, at best, the halting and muddling through pattern are going to be with us for a best, realistic case scenario is a considerable amount of tension and uncertainty avoiding a real, full-blown crisis. As Bill and I were discussing been the failure of the Europeans to ever up with the problem means that the markets are asking for more and more. life of each measure taken in the past couple of months has been so short.  The markets are now looking to see solutions for the underlying sovereign problems, and they don't see the numbers of euros on the table about Europe while.

On the other survey of business conditions noted that one-third of their equity cover, and I With respect to the fiscal cliff, it's less clear whether it's sufficiently a substantial current drag on the economy because of the motivation of businesses to defer investments and of households to potentially defer major purchases.

of the underlying fundamental problems that I would say, on balance, they're improving; and even household central part of the story, I found the data that very related piece that I saw indicated are auto sales strengthening, but in the first quarter of 2012, they were particularly among the groups with the worst credit ratings, in the highest quarter, and you wouldn't want to over-read it, as though there's a little something going on that's potentially positive in the private In terms of the outlook, the broad narrative that strikes me is one where, on the one hand, there are signs-not overwhelmingly strong, but nevertheless signs-of the private sector making meaningful progress in moving past some got us into this mess in the first place.  Banks are stronger; credit supply conditions are not improving across the board, but balance sheets seem to be strengthening.  On this last point, because the household balance sheet drag on consumption has really been such a Michael Palumbo mentioned particularly interesting.  A that not only strengthening leveraged counties, that sort of thing.  So, it's one but it feels sector.

to think about a modal outlook, ways makes the modal outlook less relevant from a decisionmaking wants to think about the downside.  Nevertheless, I'll try to just venture a thinking of, through the rest of this yearcreated by Europe seems to me as though it's reasonably well Tealbook, and I'm in accord with the Tealbook.  As I understand it, this drag is appreciation of the dollar and the decline of the stock market. I'm pretty much on line with the Tealbook there.  Second, over the medium I would say-again, it's very important 'in the modal outlook'-I have a modestly faster growth projection than the for a couple of reasons.  One is that I understand that asset price movements role in the Tealbook forecast.  And in looking in markets and the very strong safe-haven effects, it feels as though some of that dollar risk premium rather than a random walk type of So, feeding that through, that would lead me to slightly attenuate the negative alluded to as well, about the extent to which we have this strong effect where what you might call say, firms are sitting on positive-NPV Now of course, as everybody has observed, weighing very heavily against all of this are both the fiscal headwinds that have been mentioned and the enormous uncertainty associated with the situation in Europe.  This uncertainty made it very hard and, presumably, in many perspective when one couple of observations.  First, in the near term-I'm the expected degree of drag captured by the coming importantly through the So I would say run-that is to say, 2013-14-not a large difference, but to qualify by saying Tealbook baseline and, in particular, the dollar have played a strong at events effect wants to mean-revert-that is to say, it's a expectation. effects that the dollar is having on exports, say, in 2013, 2014-not a big effect, but a slight attenuation.  Second, I want to pick up on something that Governor Tarullo just mentioned and others have uncertainty is holding back corporate investment through the specific option-value-waiting-to-invest channel-that is to projects, but they say to themselves, 'Look, let me get past the next six to nine months and see if

June 19-20, 2012

If you believe that, it forward, because, of course, they're accumulating a backlog of these deferred So if the uncertainty resolves itself in an on-average way-that is to say, neither good go to what Dan referred to as a chronic muddle scenario-I think you have to, going to be a little bit of an upward tick.  Again, that up slightly-and we're not talking about a big effect-maybe twopercentage point on GDP growth relative to the Tealbook.  Qualitatively, I pretty much the same dismal picture, only a little bit different.  I would say I'm also pretty the world is going to come to an end, and then I'll pull the trigger.' obviously has very negative implications in the shorter run, but has more-ambiguous implications going projects. nor bad, and we by the logic of this thing, think that there's leads me to push my forecast or three-tenths of a have close to the Tealbook on inflation-that is to say, subdued, likely to come in on the low side as opposed to the high side.

uncertainty-making-youmay be a little less who is sitting on a project that's Instead it's, do I have no basis for thinking about whether this is a quantitatively big effect or small resonate a bit with some of the points that other people are making, and how much kick one can get out of a policy Let me just make a final observation.  If we take literally this delay-investment hypothesis, I think it follows that when you're in an environment with extremely high uncertainty, investment is going to be less responsive to interest rates than it usually is.  This is a point that a couple of other people made or extracted from some of their business contacts, which is, it's not that things aren't bad-it's just that they responsive to interest rates than usual.  Think about a manager already positive NPV, and the question is not, do you do it or not, now or never? you wait six months and see how things resolve?  And the interest rate is not going to play a big role in that. effect.  However, it does I just suspect it would lead to some attenuation of action on the interest rate at the current time.

I spoke companies-let's say more than 4 and fewer than 43 [laughter]-that globally and serve a dozen or so diverse industrial end markets in both manufacturing broad group of sectors, including automotive, construction, food years, which is very different from when I was in you know, is that our productivity has improved, and wages in emerging markets have gone up substantially, the dollar has we're more competitive, and my contacts expect that that will continue. think is terrific.  But for now, it's clear that the growth has slowed.  The general sense of it is that businesses that were growing now growing in mid-single digits, and businesses that were growing in midas at the heart of that story, including particularly partners as well.  And these companies say, the previous meeting, including industrial MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  And let me echo Governor Stein in that it's great to be here.  It's a busy contacts in the industrial patch, which was my specialty for most of my investing to a modest-sized group of are active and services.  It's quite a processing, mining, aggregates, et cetera.  What's interesting to me is that most of these companies are coming off of one or two great the business.  What's happened, as many of Chinese wages weakened, and suddenly So it's a bright future in manufacturing, which I strong economic in double digits are single digits are flat.  My contacts see Europe the effect on China and Brazil and other trading across the board, that their hiring is on hold.  So that anecdotal picture squares very well with the run of weak data that we've seen since just before production, retail sales, consumer confidence, employment, et cetera.

am in broad agreement with the 2012 part of the Tealbook baseline.  I see Therefore, I economic growth in the range of 2 percent and little progress on unemployment.  Interestingly,

June 19-20, 2012

2013 and 2014, I projected growth that was modestly above baseline, higher inflation.  I am simply not persuaded I think it's too early to say.  My underlying view is that the headwinds will we can just avoid more In the baseline, the fiscal cliff takes certainly possible.  I think it's also possible that the Congress will choose to defer broad, and that only adds to the uncertainty.  As for inflation in the I generally see the risks as weighted to slower economic growth rather growth slowing and inflation declining all over the world.  I also note I think President Evans was noting, but I don't see yet.  And of course, inflation expectations remain stable. like Governor Stein, for with faster declines in unemployment and slightly that the slowdown will carry into 2013.  The channel may be asset prices, as Governor Stein indicated, but continue to gradually abate, and so that growth will strengthen if setbacks, either the imported kind or the self-inflicted kind. a full point out of GDP growth, as Governor Tarullo was indicating, and that and worse outcomes are the pain; that has been known to happen.  However, the underlying point is that the range of outcomes is exceptionally near and medium term, than higher inflation.  I see the reports of skilled-worker shortages, as anything in the wage numbers

I also agree that the economy faces an unusually long list of near-term I've got anything to add to the discussion of these year goes on, it may be on the fiscal cliff and the debt ceiling, which are what I spent years of my life on.  And the fiscal debate is one we need to have, but my experience that the is that there will be the year goes on, and I see that as likely to damp risk-taking in the Moreover, potential downside risks.  In fact, I think we almost have to stop calling them tail risks because cumulatively they're no longer the tail.  If risks as the the last two as a participant in the debt ceiling drama of last summer leaves me with serious concerns episode next time may be even more disruptive.  In fact, the only certainty increasing uncertainty as markets and among households, businesses, borrowers, and lenders.

good debut by the new clearly weakened, repeating a springtime a couple of years.  We've received a lot of weak intermeeting dataretail sales, including auto sales; industrial production; consumer and and investment-and notably, financial conditions are tighter.  Progress in unemployment seems likely to be slow going forward, given the more moderate GDP forecast.  There was an interesting discussion about the extent to which the medium-term growth ought to be marked down.  Many people said they had not changed and risks that may last of downside risks, of which there are many, are also fiscal uncertainties, a broader slowing in the global economy, and a lack of CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  A Governors, and I thank everyone for useful, interesting comments.  I'll take a few minutes to summarize the discussion, but in light of the hour, I'll wait until tomorrow morning to give my own views on the economy.  The near-term outlook has pattern we've seen for employment reports; business surveys; reducing growth outlook for economic their medium-term forecasts very much, but Governor Yellen and a few others cited the Tarullo stuck-in-the-mud hypothesis and noted that there are persistent headwinds well into next year.

Auto sales are good, value shoppers have been pointed spending might have been the result of households dissaving to pay for gasoline prices, and that effect may disappear.  It was also noted that confidence is quite year. Turning to the household sector, those little bit upbeat.  It was noted that consumption spending has held up despite weak income growth, and lower active, and it was noted that household balance sheets are stronger.  All that said, it was out that part of the extra higher low and was damaged by the debt ceiling crisis last growth slowed during the intermeeting period, although and statistical noise may account for some of the slowdown.  U-6, another measure of was less than thought, given the stability of years.  On the other hand, there were a number of arguments important.  Some anecdotal reports on skill shortages suggested that not recruiting with was pointed out that a long spell of unemployment is not necessarily cited to the effect that inflation and nominal wages can be approach very low values.  Obviously, this is a topic that we've In the labor market, employment weather broad underutilization, remains high, and Underearners Anonymous is quite active.  There another interesting discussion today of slack in the labor market.  It was noted, for example, that on the one hand, slack in the labor market may be inflation over the last couple of made that slack is actually they may be overstated and that, in fact, employers are very picky and are much effort.  It disqualifying for most jobs, which would also mean that the long-term unemployed represent real slack.

House prices was also noted that residential investment is very overstate the benefits of that.  However, I would note parenthetically that house prices are part of consumer wealth, which is obviously a bigger a bit more mixed.  There was some commentary.  Businesses are seeing modest gains in sales and orders, and a and the Beige Book reports were a little bit more and about effects both through general uncertainty and through demand. as well, although it was pointed that if uncertainty is resolved, a backlog of projects may, in fact, create a stronger economy coal, energy-despite Included in the weak category were contractors who are concerned about sequestration and may be laying off workers. were generally a little weaker, as were comments on IT activities. expressed that China is 'dying on the case, the global slowdown does appear to be having effects, at least on certain The characterization of business activity was relatively upbeat number of people noted that their contacts upbeat than the data were.

as well as through confidence.  And on the There was a lot of interesting discussion about Europe.  I think, broadly speaking, that most people acknowledged the potential for Europe to have very significant effects on the U.S. economy.  Those effects could happen through trade financial side, asset price volatility, declines in stock markets, money funds, and other factors

June 19-20, 2012

It was noted, however, that safe-haven flows have lowered and that indicators of stress remain well below 2008-09 levels.  The way I would remains a source of a range of views on how much effect Europe will in the medium term.  The comparison to the Asia crisis was made, are much worse outcomes possible in Europe, it seems unlikely that would transmit some of the stresses. Treasury yields characterize that discussion is that the baseline scenario, in which Europe volatility but doesn't blow up, encompasses have on the U.S. economy but, to the extent that there we could escape those effects.

But it doesn't seem as though credit supply is the problem at this Bank credit quality metrics, excluding mortgages to normal or better.  Credit standards remain tight.

and about our policy pretty agonizing one.  On the economy, I think would associate myself with what's becoming the Tarullo stuck-in-the-mud hypothesismarket; wealth destruction and deleveraging; fiscal policy; financial gotten more tight; and of course, Europe.  And a new issue is, as noted, the emerging global slowdown.  All of these factors are what it otherwise might be.  I would also draw attention to made, that this recession was not caused by tight monetary policy in those in 1981-82 and 1973-75 were.  In that respect, the easing of the tight external reasons, the recovery that we're in now-almost three years CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good morning, everybody.  For my contribution to the goround, I'd like to talk a little bit, at a 30,000-foot level, about the economy tools.  To be quite honest, I think the situation is a that I that the recovery is being held back by a number of persistent headwinds.  Those include problems in the housing conditions, which have recently a number of people have preventing the recovery from being the point, which others have the same way that policy has not been the source of propulsion that it was in some earlier recoveries.  So, for a number of structural and into it-is disappointing.

The data over the law is reasserting itself, not just in If that's correct, then The Tealbook has the unemployment rate very actively are tied to unemployment rates in a number of states, they are you look at the number of individuals receiving extended unemployment benefits, A second observation is that we've been following carefully the machinations of Okun's law relationship between intermeeting period seem consistent with the view that Okun's the payroll numbers but in UI claims and other variables as well. unemployment will improve only very slowly at best. not really improving much at all over the next two years.  There is at least one complication in the outlook, which is that extended unemployment benefits are now actually disappearing.  Because they ending, and if

folks react.  Do they Moreover, we have a is going to make the assessment of labor market gains in income that otherwise situation, with some complexities associated I think that the unemployment rate, the most basic measure of utilization, at the same pace it has over the past year. it is dropping quite noticeably.  It'll be very interesting to see how those leave the labor force?  Do they find work?  Do they become unemployed? downward trend in labor force participation that conditions more difficult and will, at the same time, slow the would occur.  So we have a difficult labor market with participation, but is not likely to improve

President Fisher has been pushing for a years, is that inflation, to a first approximation, is now a globalized phenomenon. foreseeable future.  I've CRB spot price index, which is the non-energy course you know what's happened to energy prices.  We have also seen how My third general observation, along the lines that number of Commodity prices and the dollar have been central to recent swings in inflation.  From that perspective, I think we can expect inflation to be well controlled for the taken, in the past few meetings, to mentioning the commodity price index.  That index is flat for the year and down 18 percent from its April 2011 peak, and of commodity prices do feed through to some extent, at least temporarily, into core prices.  All of that suggests moderate inflation for the short to medium term.  Of course, I'm not in any way denying that monetary policy is the primary source of U.S. inflation in the longer term.

final observation-again, I'm really repeating things that people have said-is growth are clearly to the downside.  There's been an found very instructive.  I would just add that Greek banks, in particular, are now living on the Emergency Lending Governing Council, and the Spanish banks And my that the risks to the outlook for economic enormous amount of discussion of Europe, which I I think the most likely trigger point at this time might be the banking system.  As the Vice Chairman discussed, the Authority, which is at the discretion of the ECB's

June 19-20, 2012

There's a question about how far the stronger countries will be willing to go the discussions at the G-20 will lead to steps toward a banking union, a euro-zone-wide regulatory deposit insurance and restructuring regime, but occur.

risks category, I would also point to some that I would call endogenous risks.  As is growing very slowly, the internal dynamics is a risk of slipping back into a weaker growth or recession state.  In that rose only 0.4 percent during 2011, was significantly downward in Q4, and is currently shown as growing at an annual rate of gas prices will help there, but with low income growth and participation, the virtuous dynamics are hard to achieve. In the I've talked about in years past, when the economy may be such that there regard, I note that real disposable personal income revised only about a ½ percent in Q1.  Lower low labor force general observations, which are consistent with what many people economic growth slowing, with unemployment not improving, not so simple.  The a couple of words about I'll focus on balance sheet actions.  I do think there's still some scope extending the forward guidance is probably not going I'd point to four issues that I'm sure we'll hear Taking those just very around the table said, I think that if the federal funds rate were currently 3 percent, it would be a pretty straightforward call.  With and with inflation risk declining, it would be quite a straightforward call for us to ease further at this point.  And indeed, it's quite difficult to explain to the public why, given our projections, we're not doing more.  Of course, on the other side of it, we know why it's federal funds rate is not at 3 percent.  The tools that we have are of variable efficacy, and, as we've discussed, they have various costs and risks.  Let me just say those costs and risks, and for communications, but the idea of simply to be very effective.  So on the balance sheet side,

June 19-20, 2012

go-round-capital loss risk, risks about exit, financial stability consider the first two to be extraordinarily important. Federal Reserve because of our institutional need for good shape in terms of unrealized capital gains, and this is about the size of our balance and that we will not be able to exit quickly.  Personally, I think that we do have the toolsIOER, the ability to sell assets-that will allow us to exit when we need to exit.  But we have a lot more about also in the policy risks, and market functioning risks.  I don't Capital losses are a concern for the independence, but it should not be in our objective function as we look at monetary policy. Fortunately, we appear to be in pretty not likely to be a problem, as some of the preparatory material showed.  On exit, I think the main risks are that we have confidence problems-that people worry sheet the seen some effect of the expanded balance sheet on inflation expectations, the dollar, international capital flows, and the like.

issue.  Some of the concerns raised on be those associated with any kind of low interest rate policy-riskcompanies, and pension funds.  We are remain.  One, in particular, that I'm sure will be discussed and remarkably low levels, negative levels, and one reaction might be, can we make that any lower, and (b) if we do, are we risking some kind of snapback that I've thought about that quite a bit, and I would say a few things.  One is that, of course, we don't measure term premiums very well.  There are alternative that are not quite so dramatic.  I would say also that the declines in from a lot of sources, including, of course, flight to quality and changes assets.  In fact, I believe that the decline in the term premium Financial stability is, I think, a very important financial stability would taking effects on institutions like banks, life insurance monitoring those issues, but they is worth discussing is the question of the term premium on the 10-year bond.  Brian's presentation showed it at (a) would be destabilizing? thought measures of term premiums the term premiums come in correlations between different

June 19-20, 2012

well with our own I would make is that, even if term premiums as low as they can go, that does not mean that asset purchases don't have effects on the that Brian showed began last summer.  That doesn't really line up very policies, and so I'm not sure that our policies account for much of that movement.  And there may be other basic factors at work.  The other point are about economy.  There's still the portfolio balance sheet channel that causes investors to move into other types of securities.

about balance sheet policies, which came up yesterday-President are limited to beyond a certain point our holdings will begin to dominate the market. I think that, barring some change chooses to give us-which I'm not counting on-this will be The final concern Fisher asked a few questions about it-is market functioning.  Because we Treasuries and agencies, That's not only a problem for market functioning, which is important, but, if markets are no longer serving a price discovery mechanism, the efficacy of the action may also be compromised.  Now, there may be ways around this-for example, using the discount window or other tools to expand our balance sheet in different ways.  But in the authorities that the Congress a constraint at some point in the future.

Now, where do I come out on this?  My own assessment is that calculations are very complex, and this is not at It's not at all a straightforward situation of responding to a change in the outlook by funds rate. meaningful amount of policy space left.  We do could do.  But we should keep in mind that, unless I misunderstand the situation, our Therefore, the question for today's meeting and for the With all this in mind, it is clear that the all easy. cutting the federal while our remaining policy space is not infinite-it's certainly limited, and it comes with costs and uncertainties-I think that we still do have a have the capacity to expand our balance sheet somewhat more, and there are other things that we probably policy capacity is not infinite from here.

and show that the Federal Reserve is engaged, while at the same as needed?  In particular, as we discussed today, at would be a European meltdown that would have significant consequences challenging problems that I know we'll be hearing a go around the table.  No one should doubt the difficulty of these issues, and I to find a reasonable solution that will let us meet our goals, available. near term is to some extent tactical.  Given the outlook, what can we do that will, as much as possible, maintain confidence time maintaining our policy tools in reserve least one possibility for our economy.  Certainly these are very lot about as we hope we can work together and try given the limitations on the tools that we still have ask Bill to introduce the policy round. Let me stop there.

noted yesterday, in light of the recent I have marked down my near-term forecast a bit, but there's been little change to my maturity extension programs through the end year as suggested in alternative B.  Several factors shape this assessment.  First, I do not economic activity, employment, or inflation has enough to warrant such action.  The Tealbook projects 2 percent to economic growth over the next two years, picking up to around 3 percent in 2014. above trend, as they estimate it.  Indeed, the baseline outlook is to, or marginally better, I think, than what it looked like the last time we changed policy, note that the outlook marginally improved in March and April, which going back to about the same as it was then. MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I data, medium-run forecast, which I believe should be the focus of our policies.  At this juncture, I see no compelling reason to institute another round of of the think that the modal medium-term outlook for changed significantly 2¼ percent This pace is about on or slightly similar which was in January.  I we did not react to, and we didn't reduce accommodation.  Thus, I see the fact that an outlook that we had in January, when we last made a policy decision, seems consistent with having policy risks around the medium-term forecast have edged up, but I'm for us to take action at this time, particularly of the nature The main uncertainties are coming from the European I do not see how a new the maturity extension program would do anything to protect us from those and hiring.

On the a serious plunge downward, we also may have to react to appropriate tool.  If the European crisis results in financial instability here, then we might have to provide significant amounts of liquidity to the banking system and the markets.  As Brian Sack noted yesterday, proceeding with the maturity extension program does have implications for what our balance sheet looks like in terms of its maturity structure, and may for the tools Europe might have the opposite effect.  We might find a flood of liquidity States looking for safe havens.  There depend on the nature of the shock.  If might need to consider a purchases.  Such actions the shock.

To effect, it's misleading for Third, we seem to suggest in the statement that extending Operation Twist further downward pressure on rates and thus help speed and support the estimated effect is extraordinarily small at best.  Based on a recent study, long rates might move less than would reduce the unemployment rate by 0.1 percentage point after two years and raise our inflation by a similar amount.  How would the public view our action if they knew that we thought we were only me, this is the ultimate in fine-tuning.  Given the expected size of the

June 19-20, 2012

program is being implemented to support a stronger recovery or even to I don't think it does in any true sense of the word.  It appears that we can, not because we think it will accomplish anything.  I would note that the European situation has resulted in longer-term rates falling nearly 40 basis points since our last meeting.  Do we us to suggest that such a take out insurance, which we're doing something because think that seriously undermines our credibility.  I already really expect to accomplish anything by moving rates down another 5 to 8 basis points?

what are the costs of further action at this time?  I think the costs have minimal or no credibility.  We set up false expectations, or worse, we feed the view financial markets.

The bracketed paragraph seems just to may be disconcerting to markets and upsetting to them.  The other alternative B is also, I find, troubling.  I find the bracketed to talk about satisfactory progress in labor market conditions to be vague, precise, and not very helpful because we can't define it very well. of quantitative easing are mainly via stock effects, not flows.  Yet to suggest that the continuation of the MEP is about flows, not about stocks.  I think this is potentially very working off of flows? work here are.  I also think, in terms of language, that paragraph 5 about the European situation, which has been added at the end, is potentially dangerous.  We've already in the paragraph the restate that, and it actually boilerplate language we use in language that we use not very give my reaction to alternative B .  First, I want to thank both the Board for obviously taking the memo that Presidents Williams and Kocherlakota and I was to try to restructure our language to be clear about the linkages what our actions are-that is, a kind of verbal reaction able to make that clearer to the public and improve our communications. is that it doesn't really capture the essence of what I clear.

I think we can build a little more robust way of looking at this Committee and might get people more about and writing the statement in this way.  If the Committee is we would be happy to undertake that initiative.  That's all I have, Mr. Chairman. significant risks for the outlook, then we ought to be making actions and why this action is related to providing insurance which it would do that.  Presumably, it would do that by improving the economic outlook, which should be the mechanism.  I don't think we ought to try to restructure the and in fact, I don't think that was our intention.  Rather, we give it some thought.  If the Committee is interested in exploring this way of writing statements, I think Presidents Kocherlakota meetings-after the meeting is over Committee-to suggest, and circulate that and let the Committee see how we envision this might evolve.  And that would challenge us to consider how would we want to do this in various scenarios, because we may over a period of time that might be helpful to the comfortable in thinking interested,

Mr. Chairman, I MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'm into two pieces.  I'm MEP to the end of the decision.  And then I'll talk about some have to say, I'll be deviating somewhat from my prepared remarks in light of the comments that you made about the limitations on our balance sheet tools.  I think those are very important

recommendations about how alternatives B Plosser, and I a memo describing an approach to rewriting the FOMC statement in a way that the evolution of the economy, the actions being undertaken by to accomplish-focusing on this idea of a and responsive to our concerns in this way.  Ultimately, I agree with Bill English this is a notable change in what we're doing, and I think that we want to be deliberate about And, as President Plosser has said, I don't think B  gets at what exactly I read B , I don't feel that it highlights the kinds of changes in the outlook I heard highlighted around the table yesterday.  If you go to the middle of paragraph 4, the is a key phrase:  'these risks have become somewhat greater year.'  We haven't heard everyone, and everyone has a say, of course, but that's adopting this policy action. Let me start by supposing that the Committee is going to adopt the extension of the maturity extension program as its policy action today.  I have three the Committee might craft the statement given that decision.

the things that have changed that make the Committee undertake this action.  To for us to proceed on this, if the statement with our own version of it.  Also, in I had to do things again, I would have written a little bit more about why we like our FOMC statement.  That would have helped make things clear.  That'll going forward as we circulate our KPW versions of the FOMC I was thinking about this meeting and the next one, but we'll see. a good challenge for us, as Charlie had said, to try to figure out how you write a statement reaction function that doesn't really react to every change in conditions.  After think the right step is to talk to the communications subcommittee and plan a way forward that we won't do anything.  But at least for myself, I you.  However, for today, I would over B in terms of a statement. highlighting follow on what President Plosser said, I think the right way Committee will indulge us, is to track the FOMC hindsight, if statement better than the be good for us to be doing statement for this meeting. It's when we have a that, I based on that.  Maybe the result will be think this will be helpful, and I hope it will be for the rest of recommend B ′, about to comments that Governor Raskin made yesterday about expectations. would strongly recommend that the Committee adopt paragraph 3 of alternative A, as opposed fact that it expects conditions to reason for doing the action, whereas in paragraph 3 of alternative A, the am going to talk about it practically.  I talk on an ongoing who say, 'When the Committee says it's going to keep rates low, and Now, my second recommendation-and this will build into my theme communication-relates I to paragraph 3 of alternative B.  The difference between these two paragraphs is that in paragraph 3 of alternative B, the Committee is highlighting the remain weak as a Committee is highlighting what it hopes to achieve-'in order to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate.'

So I would recommend that. it couches it in the way that it has, the takeaway is, boy, aggregate demand is going to be weak going forward, and so I should make my business paragraph 3 of alternative A, I think, is more appropriate-it emphasizes how the policy is fostering gets to a point that Bill mentioned-about the lack of clarity in on the size and characteristics of the program that is being feel very uncomfortable with undertaking a new policy action without seeing much are we planning to buy?  What does 'about three years' mean, as years'?  This really gets to the heart of transparency and clarity.  I think we as we were about the original program in September.

get comments I made at the end of my economic go-round.  As I highlighted at go-round, other than myself, all other FOMC participants project that choice of appropriate monetary policy.  There are a couple of reasons can answer for themselves, I guess.  One possibility out of tools, that this is the best we can do-to have inflation at 2 or less get on an ongoing basis in actually do better if we take into communication channels that I think do remain available to us. Let me talk a little bit, then, about the SEP and communication.  And this is going to back to some of the the end of the economic under appropriate monetary policy, headline inflation will be 2 percent or less in 2014, even though unemployment will be above 6.3 percent.  Now, these are, again, forecasts being made under each participant's why people could be doing this, and people is that people feel we're and unemployment as high as this.  That contradicts the analysis we the staff memos and in the Tealbook, that appropriate policy can account the

June 19-20, 2012

I'm going to talk more FOMC participant could instead report projections that are based on more generates higher inflation-either that this is your either that we don't have the tools to do above 2 is worse-I statement in January, I think that conversation suggests that the reading of it.  At least to me, the fact that the SEP has everyone communicating to of providing accommodation to the economy. we're providing today as well.  So I think this is not just of intellectual interest, which it of course also of enormous policy interest.  I think it is necessary to get a discussion framework statement has built into it some notions of be tolerated to get faster reductions in The other possibility is about objective functions, and that's what about.  Any accommodative policy than policy having inflation at 2 or less and unemployment at 6.3 or above.  But the cost is there, too; more-accommodative policy the modal outlook or the risk of inflation being higher than 2 percent.  By saying choice under accommodative policy, you're saying better or that the objective function is asymmetric, in the sense that having would say much worse-than being below 2.  Now, last September, Mr. Chairman, I tried to initiate a conversation within the Committee about objective functions, about loss functions. And after the release of our consensus framework is more necessary than ever.  That consensus framework statement really Committee views 2.1 percent inflation as not being all that much worse than 1.9 percent inflation, or at least that was my at 2 and under, except for myself, while unemployment is above what appears to be consistent with our mandate, suggests that participants have a much less symmetric objective function over inflation deviations.  Now, this is where it gets important-that's what we're the public about what we're willing to do in terms That's going to cut back on how much stimulus conversation about objective functions would be, but it's going on this.  If we all agree that our symmetry that small deviations in inflation should

But maybe others will be able to clarify this for me-in June to describe the details of the program in that way, in the directive, whereas in September, we actually had it in the statement itself.

Well, we can discuss it, but I think the idea is to express the CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. continuity of the program with what we have been doing.

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you.

I ask Narayana a question?

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Certainly.

you favor the alternative A B language for paragraph 3? MR. TARULLO.  Narayana, could you repeat the reason why language for paragraph 3 over the alternative

When the Committee says they're going to keep rates low are multiple ways to interpret it, but I will emphasize two ways.  One is next two and a half going to keep rates low.  Many people think of us as having lots of private going to evolve, and then their take-away from that is, Fed has this private information that things are going to be bad.'  The other way, I think is how it's intended, is that we're trying to actually provide stimulus to the MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. through late 2014, there that the Committee is saying, the economy is going to be really bad for the years, and so we're information about how the economy is 'Boy, the which

I'm sorry-what's the specific language difference? MR. TARULLO.

Whereas and it says that we're 'maintaining exceptionally low levels for the federal funds to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure the difference? MR. TARULLO.  I'm sorry.  So you mean moving what's the introductory clause of paragraph 3 into the action sentence?  Do you think that's

gap over the next year appears to years and missing from the same direction each part of our dual MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  The economy has slowed, and progress toward closing the large unemployment have stalled.  Furthermore, the drop in oil and other commodity prices and the absence of wage pressures have shifted the outlook for inflation lower.  Thus, we will be falling short on both employment and inflation for

June 19-20, 2012

the balance toward action.  The question is, should we conduct alternative A, or additional maturity extension, as in B? correct.  It helps support low long rates, as we've already agree it won't do much on its own, and there are inherent limits to how large a But it will signal that we're vigilant and we're ready and willing to do what maturity extension program envisioned in mandate.  And the risks to the outlook for economic activity are overwhelmingly to the downside.  So this situation tilts more large-scale asset purchases, as in Maturity extension is directionally seen.  Now, I move we can make. is needed.  So for today, I support continuing the alternative B.

I would actually stay with B(3).  But I do think it is action is justified in the statement addition of the modifier 'very' in front of 'gradually' and then by replacing 'gradually' think, from our a more fundamental shift in our view about both the economy and about I propose that the second sentence of augmented to summarize the rationale for the change in our outlook, which that the sentence would read, greater strains in global gradually.'  To me, this connects the data and our views about going on in Europe to our outlook, which then sets up the policy rationale. I do have one suggestion for the statement.  In responding to President Kocherlakota's recommendation, first, let me just say important to provide the rationale for our policy action in our statement.  As we all know, paragraph 1 just describes the data.  Paragraph 2 covers the outlook but does not explain clearly how or why the outlook has changed.  In essence, the policy by the with 'only slowly' in the next sentence.  I find this unnecessarily subtle.  I discussion, that we have the developments in Europe and financial strains. paragraph 2 be would obviously set up the change in policy.  So my suggestion is 'With somewhat less recent momentum in domestic demand and financial markets, the Committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up very what's

June 19-20, 2012

MS. YELLEN.  Could you read that again?

less recent greater strains in global financial markets, the Committee MR. WILLIAMS.  Of course.  The sentence would read, 'With somewhat momentum in domestic demand and expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up very gradually.'

If you did that, would you cut the sentence that starts CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. 'Furthermore'?

I would keep the as the risk.  It seems, at least in my view, that what people here are and changes in global financial conditions.  In addition, I would layer I was just trying to capture that in my B.  Thank you. MR. WILLIAMS.  I thought about that.  It repeats that phrase, but 'Furthermore' sentence talking about and what the Tealbook said is a big part of the change in the outlook, is actually developments in Europe on top of that that the data have been somewhat weaker. suggestion for

I do not believe that the current calls for any falling, driven by the decline in oil prices, and we're likely to get lower readings on core inflation in the short term as a result of pass-through of dip in inflation will be temporary.  As from energy prices that results in transitory movements in core inflation. expectations have been well behaved, so at this point, the behavior of inflation, in my view, doesn't warrant further

And I think we all share that sense of excruciating dislocation and loss at what labor markets could have done had they lived up to our expectations a couple of substantial difference in the path of the unemployment rate without also raising inflation by more than would be desirable and in a way that would ultimately raise the costs of achieving our inflation objective over the longer term.  As market outcomes will affect inflation as well. We need to take both effects into account, and we laid out how we do so in our consensus statement in January.

The flip side of that is You mentioned a couple Maintaining confidence-with all due respect, I on views about fundamentals or about the likely or abroad.  President Plosser pointed out some adverse effects that this policy on confidence in us and on our credibility.  And President Kocherlakota pointed out ways in which this policy action could damp expectations about future the Fed

really do.  So I think the appropriate stance now would be to wait and watch to erode, or that there's a shortfall in inflation to be persistent.  If further easing is warranted, an extension of the action that attempts to work through lowering not ask Mary Miller to do it?  Should we want would need to either increase aggregate reserve balances that it encourages people to believe that we believe that we have far more effect on the real economy than we for evidence that inflation expectations are likely below target that's likely maturity extension program would not be my preferred tool.  I think that the theory behind the interest rate effects of the MEP is tenuous and the empirical evidence of such effects is unconvincing.  And I question whether any policy longer-term risk-free rates can be expected to have much effect in the current environment. Moreover, this policy raises the question of, why to provide further stimulus, I think we the interest rate on reserves. or change banks' incentives to hold reserves by changing

So I believe that, were we to go Now, I've listened to the arguments around this table enormous respect because of open acknowledgment that they're so much better trained than I am.  I've heard arguments that further monetary accommodation would raise inflationary expectations-magnify the fear, perhaps, that the Fed expanding their balance sheet, and consequently the money supply, so dramatically that inflation would inevitably follow.  And the result, I've been led to believe, would be scare money out of the businesses' pockets into job creation and would lead individuals to conclude they'd better spend their money today rather than have it depreciated by inflation tomorrow, and thus pump up consumption and final demand.  But acknowledging my limited economic learning.  I would argue piling on the already enormous uncertainty and policy.  To me, as Committee.

It's completely logical for without there being any leaks whatsoever. I think that's really dangerous to make statements like that. that on the Desk or other Wall Street Journal can look at the same set of evidence that we look at and reach the same conclusion that we're going to reach; there's nothing surprising about that.  I'm not saying that leaks never occur, but Wall Street Journal concludes something similar to what we conclude.  They're looking at the same set of we're looking them to reach the same conclusion that we're reaching So

I'm sure others feel the same way, Vice Chairman Dudley.  I'm just when we talk about market expectations, we should consider what affects expectations.  But I goes on.  And I see Governor all upset.

And we allowed everybody to take mortgage refinancing, and they had more income and could spend.  But the 1990s anymore.  They're not here available to help bail out the mark at that time, which wasn't in its best interest economically.  Eventually, it failed, money, and he was able to accelerate that.  We'd better hope that that ahead of us.  Over the next two or more through expanding their world was able to help.  Through capital flows into the U.S., we had low Treasury had a more vibrant American consumer.  Financial conditions advantage of American consumer doesn't live here rest of the world.  The arithmetic of imbalances kills in this case.  On top of that, I think we really need to pray that there's not a second-generation George Soros somewhere who somehow devises a punishing short strategy against Germany.  George Soros was able to break the back of the Bank of England when it tried to maintain a monetary policy to benchmark against the deutsche and Soros made a lot of financial product doesn't exist and cause something to happen quicker than anybody is hoping.

also think that we're fighting last century's war-that it's just normal bread-and-butter for conservative central bankers.  We have chosen to fixate on our 2 percent inflation when the risks to us are enormous.  I can't write down exactly the parallels to there-where there's a I think that all of President comments about our ineffectiveness, with all of the funds on the sidelines and our they're extraordinarily challenging ones. I times objective at a time the gold standard in the 1930s, but it looks to me as though they must be tremendous debt overhang, and the restrictive policies that banks around the world were following in the 1930s led them toward more-restrictive policies. Fisher's current policies in place, were expressed in Friedman and Schwartz's chapter on the Great Contraction.  These are not new observations, but

June 19-20, 2012

enough so that we could be facing, at some point, 3 percent inflation that try to eradicate the risk of 2½ percent inflation, which to defend a lower inflation objective than our stated 2 percent objective, researchers are probably going to find evidence that we're acting as if our symmetric around something that's below 2 percent, not 2 percent.  At a time like today, I actually quite restrictive.  Milton Friedman expressed that about Japan that low short-term interest rates are generally a sign that a recession occurs, we're not going to I favor strongly proactive monetary policy to push us as far away from these risks possible.  I think that, looking at the staff projections in the Tealbook, It certainly has risks, but risks everywhere.  The optimal control simulations also display that.  Of course, it's make the argument and convince people that we would have the commitment to do are a programs that we could embark upon and simply state what we're just a poor man's The standard errors of our inflation forecasts are large-unconditionally, they're always large.  And they're large through no additional fault of what we're doing.  That's just the statistics, and it can never be ruled out.  But we're seeking policies is well within those types of bands.  I frankly think that outcome can only be confidently delivered if we're trying and I worry that future goal is think these policies are and in other cases quite well.  He said money has been too tight.  When our medium-run inflation forecast continues to be below our inflation objective throughout our forecast horizon with unacceptable resource slack, I think Friedman's admonition is just dead right in that regard.  If be able to escape the zero lower bound over the time horizon that any of us expect to be on this Committee. and horrific outcomes as nominal-level income targeting would clearly have a positive effect. we're facing difficult to that, although I frankly don't think it's as challenging as a lot of people would say.  There variety of asset purchase intending to do.  I think that that could implement that.  My suggestions about economic thresholds related to 7 percent unemployment and 3 percent inflation-it's

But I with going going to go right, and we ought to choose how that version of nominal-level income targeting. have much avail-but it's still an option.  Can these policies fail? think that we should affirmatively choose what type of failure we're willing to live forward, because something is probably not should play out.

If anything, I think easing today might be worsening the risks to the U.S.  The ECB is at least temporarily on the decisions from reluctant governments in Europe.  Our easing, all else equal, puts upward pressure on the euro, makes a recession in the EU worse, and increases effect, but it seems to me to be ill timed for the U.S. to a move at this juncture.

My position hasn't changed on this.  I think slack is a very poor policy, and it can lead to exceptionally poor decisions.  I have three the theory side or conceptual side, the second is the measurement side, associated with Michael have a blind spot when we use that theory.  The output gap in that I these comments for basis for making monetary areas of concern.  One is and the third is the relationship to inflation.  On the theory side, just conceptually, we have a leading theory in monetary economics, the New Keynesian theory Woodford and his colleagues.  We should use it, and we do use it.  It does inform our judgments around the table, but we theory is the distance between the flexible price level of output and the sticky price level of

June 19-20, 2012

whether the sticky price level of output will be different from that flexible price level of the output gap is radically different from what we use around this output, and the flexible price level of output moves around in response to shocks.  If the economy is hit by a large shock, output will fall even in the flexible price economy, and the only question is of output.  That concept table, and so on the conceptual side, I do not think we have this right, and we should get it right.

The most difficult part of measurement is when there are permanent changes in trend. occurring in the U.S. economy as we speak, and that U.S. potential output growth is lower.  The staff have slack that they estimate in the economy. Orphanides did exceptional work studying the 1970s and argued, I think pretty improper measurement of the output gap led to exceptionally poor decisions on monetary policy both in the U.S. and abroad.  It led to global inflation that took decades to repair.  The lesson from the four recessions in the United States in 13 years.

and measurement arguments-there's I'm willing to accept existing estimates of the output gap to get an estimate of inflation, those relationships are also quite tenuous opinion, of helping us predict inflation.

Price-level targeting is optimal policy in a lot you look at the price-level path in the U.S. consistent with a 2 percent rate of increase in prices.  And in fact if you your starting point sometime in the mid-1990s and you look at where the price level is away from If you look at the United States Great Depression, that was certainly not true.  And if you look at Japan, it is also in Japan has actually declined over time.  In those got appropriate policy at this point.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just have one more nominal income targeting, I of the models that we look at.  However, I think if since the 1990s, it's very take as today, it's about on target or even a little bit above target.  So I'm not too concerned that we've missed on the price-level aspect and that we've allowed the price level to move far the appropriate price-level path.  Even though the Committee was not price-level targeting during that period, we've ended up on the right price-level path. during the certainly not true-the price level circumstances, I think the price level moved far away from what might have been considered the optimal price-level path.  But that has not occurred, and that gives me some confidence that we've

With the benefit decision in April not to move forward the liftoff prudent one.  So our patience was justified.  I would prefer to take action on the basis of more solid information, because it is quite possible that to developments, then I could see the basis for supporting even stronger alternative action today is that I think it's worth low interest rates for years now, and most of us expect that these low rates are likely to prevail for a more years.  We have a very large balance sheet and one with a much longer duration can, and we have As Brian Sack reminded us yesterday, we considerable downside risks to the outlook for growth, particularly from Europe against the risk that growth could result, as I mentioned yesterday, in an unwelcome disinflation.  I 10-year inflation expectations have been declining, and there is a As this The second reason I have for holding off any reflecting on the fact that we have been in an environment of exceptionally a number of couple of than we are accustomed to holding.  We have done the best analysis we decided that the risks to the economy from our actions are likely to be small.  Partly as a result of this belief, the benefits of our actions appear to clearly outweigh the cost.  However, I think that we should be mindful about how little we actually know about these costs-such as the disruption in market functioning that, Mr. Chairman, you mentioned earlier-and we should be mindful that we could be underestimating these costs. are operating in uncharted waters.  Clearly, the risks to the outlook have increased since our last meeting.  I see and our own fiscal cliff.  So I can see some benefits of buying insurance weaker economic mentioned yesterday that the risk that inflation could fall below our inflation objective over the medium term.

Again, this is a close call for me today, but I will join you, Chairman, and the majority of the Committee and support alternative B today.  Thank you.

If this assessment new actions.  An extension of the MEP is a very promote our objectives.  On risk-management grounds, action now.  President Evans has made that comments on this score.  However, I can support an extension of the MEP today, forgoing stronger actions judgment that might entail an overreaction to the spate of weak data continuation of the MEP as a temporizing move, a way to signal to markets that we're awake,

June 19-20, 2012

recent developments, that we do not see the economy as strong enough actions may be necessary to promote economic growth and address that we're concerned by yet to withdraw the medication regime that's been in place, and that we're watching and waiting to evaluate what further downside risks.  Today's action keeps the door open to doing more.  It's natural to extend a program that's in place and would otherwise end now, and doing so has limited downside risk.

consider it essential, though, for the FOMC to be forward leaning, to assure markets and paragraph 4 of B accomplishes that without committing the Committee to QE3. I fear, action proves necessary in the days ahead, I'm open to a further LSAP, including a forward guidance.  I also think we should give devise something new, conceivably an innovative discount window Bank of England.  If we do decide I'm attracted to the revised forward that follows the suggestion of President maintaining a highly accommodative monetary would wait to introduce that language until such time as we decide to change the we would lack the context-I think it would be constructive suggestion. I the public that we will act if it's necessary to prevent the economy from stalling out, and I think the language in If, as program that's open ended, or an extension of our priority to attempting to program to stimulate lending along the lines announced by the at a future meeting to move out the date, I'd like to say that guidance language proposed in alternative A Kocherlakota and Governor Raskin.

I forward guidance, on the grounds that today confusing.  But it's a very

June 19-20, 2012

acknowledging this in your opening remarks.  I wondered why alternative B a stock amount.  It was conclusion that it was the election and the fiscal cliff, was an odd time to choose for ending the MEP, and figured out why we weren't announcing a total.  The whole program amounts only to a $267 billion-and I considered 'measly,' 'dinky,' 'small.'  By December, we're going doing what we can as early as we can so that we can get the effects face of shocks, but as we run out of options in risks, I think we need to count our remaining moves and in terms of market 'flash bang' options, we could need them if the creates conditions that require a confidence-building move calibration of the costs and benefits.  And I illustrates just how limited our remaining arsenal actually is.  So I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for expressed the MEP extension as a flow with an end date rather than as my understanding, as President Plosser said, that we'd come to the stock rather than the flow that drove the market reaction.  And I also thought that the end of the year, given the then I measly to be emptying the lint out of our pockets to find short-term securities to sell.  We've talked often about the advisability of sooner and create a more resilient recovery in the the face of some pretty scary downside make sure that we use them when they'll have the greatest impact.  Realistically, we have at best two $500 billion weapons left before the tradeoffs start getting really dicey functioning, and while those aren't exactly European situation or the fiscal cliff from the Fed.  At this point, I admit that my policy preferences are driven more by the desire to maintain confidence than by my forecast or a fine suppose that my stance doesn't fit well with anyone's view of better communication.

few changes that are not required as possible, and so I would keep B rather than A until we were changing something else in there.  I would not use 5.  I do In terms of what we do with the statement, I'm going to continue to follow the Tarullo rule, which is to make as 3 from

I think, though, that we've got, as Betsy to medium-term problem, which is planning for I listen around the table today, it feels to me as though there's a clear path in many people's minds if something really adverse happens in Europecontinue along in the mud, to resurrect my metaphor, us; with the fiscal cliff looming over us; with growth; but without the catalyzing event of a that almost forces action by us and maybe on a coordinated basis with that the answer a number of people would give would be to do a number of people around the table who would like options as associated with larger or continuing purchases.  We side MR. TARULLO.  Thank of people have already commented, the effectiveness of it in real terms is probably somewhat limited.  There's obviously some psychological benefit associated with it, particularly in light of the forecasts that we're just indicated and as others have said, a shortwhat else we may do.

But it's substantially less clear to me what people think reasonable options are in the event that we for some time to come, with Europe looming over clearly subpar, perhaps even subtrend, economic major shock in Europe other central banks.  I know nothing, but obviously there are well.  And I'd like to echo what Sandy said a moment ago about the need to better understand the costs to market functioning that would be allude to those costs, and Brian occasionally tries to give us some, maybe somewhat intuitive, sense of when those costs will begin to be experienced.  But trying to understand the costs

We're now at least four years into crisis, recession, and clearer way out now and the kind of recovery that the a while kept bumping off another couple of quarters but still saw on the horizon, effective than it was reasons and with a different set of dynamics than I do think, in the spirit of sensible-even lower-probabilitygot to at least begin thinking about that possibility and what it given the other circumstances we confront. I think Charlie Evans was trying not to be alarmist while still stating a fact that probably poor recovery, and instead of seeing a Tealbook for we're facing perhaps as serious a crisis as we experienced in financial markets in late 2008, even though the epicenter now would be across the Atlantic.  This at least raises the prospect that we really are slipping into something substantially more chronic from which it's harder to emerge. And just sitting and waiting for things to repair themselves may be no more in the 1930s, although for a different set of persisted then.  I don't think Charlie tried to suggest that that was the case now; I'm certainly not trying to suggest it.  But contingency planning, we've means for monetary policy

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Stein.

I'm essentially in making disappointingly slow progress on coming below our further accommodation.  On top of that, there are the potentially severe downside risks framed it, Mr. Chairman, as you did, which is, I would be unambiguously in favor of easing. MR. STEIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B. agreement with the staff's forecast, which has us output and on unemployment and which sees inflation as subdued, likely 2 percent target.  So it seems to me that both sides of our mandate point pretty clearly toward a need for associated with the current situation in Europe.  I started by asking myself, if we were away from the zero lower bound, what would we do?  And I clearly say, I think it's not a close call.  I

I think the further stimulative benefits of doing so at this time, to be quite small and because I feel that there are a variety of potential I would echo what President Pianalto saidat least I, in my own mind, have not fully come to grips have already been enumerated, and I won't go over them again.  I did I thought was possibly relevant and which looms larger when environment that we're in.  That is to say, the 10-year Treasury was, as Brian described yesterday, term premiums-expected at least recent-history lows and are something like 150 At the same time, I, too, find the analysis to be less straightforward when we have to provide that further accommodation by quantitative means-that is to say, by buying more longterm bonds.  This is both because while positive, are likely costs and simply raw uncertainties-and here associated with the bond purchases that with.  A number of these want to flag one particular cost that we're in the interest rate of this morning, I think, about 1.62 and, as returns on these Treasuries-are near

Spreads were abnormally wide, and in you could say that we were moving prices closer to where they would be in an Just to push the logic a little bit further, you could imagine a in which we kept buying MBS to the point where somehow the spread on Treasuries.  Presumably this would have some stimulative effect, basis points below their norms over the last 15 or so years.  Here's a very gut-level way to say it: It just feels strange to me to want to be buying price is abnormally high the word, we than closer.  And note that this is the opposite of what we did in QE1, when the Fed was effectively acting as some sense, idealized, frictionless world. hypothetical situation MBS was negative relative to but one might at the same time worry that there are some allocative distortions beneath that stimulative effect.

I can be more precise and I think the nature of the costs might be in this particular case.  One story that been repeated around this table over the last couple of days for why we have such strongly as a safe haven want to be able getting a flow of benefits from holding long-term Treasuries-that way that you accept a reduced return on currency, you return on long-term Treasuries.  So if this interpretation is right-if some of the Treasuries, if you reduce the supply of this valuable money-like Now, this is all, admittedly, very loose.  And let me see if characterize what has negative term premiums in long-term Treasuries is that right now, they're serving for investors who want, in some sense, absolute surety on their investment.  They to park it in a place where they really don't have to worry about it.  You might say, in some sense, that these investors are is, in a way, it's money-like.

Nonetheless, I believe that the chances a substantial output gap now. MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'm have struggled with the nagging thought that there may be a plausible alternative, which is to hold off for now, wait and see how the economy and the situation in Europe evolve, and perhaps keep our remaining powder dry in case there's a many of the concerns raised around the table.  Briefly, to start back somebody who does see dangers of are that there's efficacy of further balance sheet actions to close you straight to the issues that the continue to struggle with, particularly the the limits of asset purchases.  I note that there is an article on FT a bar to the MEP.  I mentioned Alphaville; I understand that.  But just to echo extent it's possible to be more precise about what they are, I would love to for using further quantitative easing if we have to, I weigh the arguments significant financial market stress and the very real threat that it could get a lot agree with what However, I harbor real doubts about the that.  So the argument is, why not try?  And that leads Chairman raised succinctly at the beginning, which I thought that we're approaching Alphaville this morning talking about illiquidity and that being this to Brian beforehand, and they're far ahead of what President Pianalto and Governor Tarullo said, I'd personally like to understand those limits much better.  To the do that.  But perhaps that's an argument beyond the MEP, as more of a defensive weapon going forward.  As against extending the MEP, in the end, I don't find them carrying the day, mostly because of the presence of worse.  This is a particularly bad time to withdraw accommodation.  And I Governor Stein said-it's important that the Fed send the signal that we do have additional

It doesn't cost us much to extend the program whether this action will have much of an effect on longermore-accommodative which I mean lower risk premiums, increased liquidity, and reduced risk the real economy.  So, on that find myself in support of alternative B.  Finally, I join the chorus of those urging the nonFinally, it's hard for me to say term rates or produce the forecasted reduction in unemployment or the slight increase in inflation.

Obviously, that depends on the In terms of monetary policy actions, as opposed to special liquidity facilities, if escalate, I'd be most inclined toward another large-scale asset purchase program.  I work on two margins:  first, the level of long-term interest rates; and second, the between agency MBS yields and Treasury rates.  However, the potential size of an MBS new agency MBS production, and if we go you wanted to do something powerful-say, going beyond $500 billion over the next 12 monthsI would also strongly consider altering our forward guidance and working to can imagine that a I think that seeing what could be a long-term discount window lending program is something that we need to what problem are we with such a program, how operationally feasible it is, and how quickly it that during the crisis, there were a lot of proposals to do also have to be very careful that we don't step engaging in fiscal action.

make one final point about communication.  We have these meetings, and what some of us would like to do individually.  It's very important, when people when they disagree with the policy choices, that they do not totally trash choices that the Committee has made, because in totally trashing the policy choices of that policy.  For I think, President Fisher, using phrases like 'road to perdition' just goes too far.

Again, I don't make any strong except gives us a great deal of flexibility to go forward and to make choices based on how the economy and the outlook evolve.  I would push back just a little on the idea that this is an action that has essentially no consequences.  The standard calculation suggests that this is roughly a federal funds rate cut of between 25 and 50 basis points.  Does that sound right, Bill?

I have it, the introductory phrase would be, 'With somewhat less recent momentum in greater strains in global financial markets, the Committee expects CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The other suggestion was the one President Williams had on the language in paragraph 2.  Perhaps we could just see if there's broad interest in this or not.
