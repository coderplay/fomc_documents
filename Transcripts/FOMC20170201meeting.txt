MR. TARULLO.  Second.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection.  Okay.  Our sixth agenda item is on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, also known as the consensus We made important changes last year.  But, this year, only one small, routine change the annual updating of the reference to the median of FOMC participants' the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.  In this case, it's an update from to 4.8 percent.

The minutes will be would be released, first, this year coming I should note that the first day of the semiannual monetary policy be February 14, which is released on February 22.  So the updated consensus statement in the Monetary Policy Report and then would also be included in the minutes.

item 7, which is about revisions to the external in early December, took comments, and then circulated a final Let's see.  That takes us to communications policies.  As you know, the subcommittee on communications provided a memo on this topic to the Committee proposal on January 18.

most of us would agree that an earlier start to the blackout is compelling in order first circulation to participants of draft policy alternatives.  Starting blackout the appearance that the Federal Reserve staff might be divulging confidential FOMC helpful. I think to align it with the just before draft policy alternatives are distributed should help prevent FOMC participants or information.  I believe the other proposed policy changes-almost all of which deal with blackout issues-are also to approve them, will be effective immediately. the revised schedule would be in effect builds in a transition period of a bit more than a month. Now, the new policies, if you vote However, because the first date of the earlier blackout under Saturday, March 4, the proposal

during the extended As was noted in the January 18 memo, the subcommittee and I strongly recommend that, if it's reasonably possible, participants cancel any appearances to speak

other than monetary policy.  But the recommended that the Committee authorize the Chair to make determinations cannot be canceled and for which the topic these circumstances, the participant or to refrain from accessing in any way draft monetary policy or other Class I or Class II FOMC information prepared for the relevant Committee blackout period or choose to speak about a topic subcommittee whether to approve any preexisting commitments that cannot be changed.  And for any approved appearances in staff member would be required alternatives meeting in the weeks prior to the preexisting speaking engagement.

that these changes to the communications policies, if we adopt the minutes of this meeting are released on February 22. the staff will need to move ahead shortly after the meeting to implement the new members who will need to be involved in implementation do not Accordingly, I'm recommending that the Committee agree that that would normally be Class III FOMC information until their instead be labeled Internal FR until their publication on February 22.  That way, the staff or publications can be informed of the new policies and implement them before they're published. Finally, I should note them, will not become public until Principals and requirements, but some staff actually have FOMC clearance. the new communications policies release who are involved with appearances immediately start to there for a second.

Well, seeing no further comments, like the appropriate, as we did in the case of the first start with a straw poll of all Committee participants to gauge the call for a narrower vote by the I'd like to start with a straw poll and ask you to please raise your hand if you are Let me take a breather policies from participants? consensus statement, our guidelines on external communications have a significance that carries beyond a single year.

[Show of hands] Okay.  What I see is unanimous support for these members of the Committee.  All in Okay.  The ayes have item 8, which is the 'Proposed Addition of Fan Charts to the Economic Projections.'  As you know, the Committee has been discussing for some addition of fan charts to the SEP that would depict uncertainty in the In early November, the subcommittee circulated a revised proposal to the members consulted with each The subcommittee then provided an update to the Committee in early addressed comments raised in the November conversations.  My understanding is that they would not object to moving forward.  My personal view fan charts are a useful and straightforward way to convey to the public the uncertainty surrounding the SEP numbers. Okay.  That takes us to Summary of time the possible projections.

But the fact that I think opportunity to have some discussion about ways that it might should step

YELLEN.  Okay.  Well, we will consider taking that up in due course and minutes of this meeting will note that participants agreed to include fan charts of implementation, a staff paper to the public shortly after the publication of the minutes of the We will provide you with that paper in advance of its publication, and I also Public Affairs Office will release charts so the public can see what they will look like.  Those would use data December 2016 SEP.  And my understanding is that we don't need a vote on this, go ahead and do it. CHAIR consult with the subcommittee on communications about that.

In general, we aim to conduct small-value exercises for operations categorized twice per year.  Thank you, and I'm

I'm getting a lot from both bankers and nonbankers about the policy, and the memo that you my question.  Do you have a sense of whether the market participants that are thinking about our change in policy tied to a level of the funds rateSo they think in terms of, 'Okay, they're going to change or to a certain level,' and then that thinking in terms of, 'It's really in six months or the beginning of next year at funds rate would be at that time.'  Because I think what we're trying to MS. MESTER.  Can I ask another question on the reinvestment policy? of questions distributed triggered answered the questions and then the timing comes after that? their policy when the funds rate goes up by a certain amount informs when it's going to happen?

So I would be curious about what it forward, and some of that must have just been passing of But of those who brought the date forward, 20 of the 26 changed the actual funds rate that connected to.  So there was some change going on during the intermeeting period of the funds rate that they were connecting the timing to. MS. LOGAN.  I think you could think of it both ways.  Of the 31 respondents that made a change to the timing, 26 brought time. it's actual federal

DUDLEY.  If you look at the answers over time, though, it looks VICE CHAIRMAN like we're tied to a level.

MS. LOGAN.  A lot of people are expecting us to do it once-

It's been between about 1 and 1½ percent for over 12 months.  And this after the rate increase and the change of language in the postmeeting the 'flash' survey after the December 2015 meeting, they thought 12 months federal funds rate could likely have been in that the market path flattened and the SEP changed, you could see some of them.  The dealers are more likely to have it be state on the buy side, but there is a general movement in that what 'well under way' means. MR.

There is uncertainty about

I think the other thing that little bit more complicated this past intermeeting period is because we to reevaluate:  'Well, maybe lower federal funds rate than we thought before.'  So our discussion of pulled some people forwardVICE CHAIRMAN happened that made it a talked about the reinvestment policy in the minutes, people started it's going to happen at a it may have level of the rate MS.

Yes.  I think these questions may be triggered by the same thought that I'm starting to think about as well as we start to engage in this.  We are going to the federal funds rate, then, essentially, you're priming to expect two changes at the same meeting, which I think is a lot to digest.  And so in some clearly MS.

I'll called 'Material for Briefing on the from December, but I've been oversight governor, all of you sit around and memorize the Tealbook in every respect, albeit a little more briefly than Our forecast this time is essentially unrevised admonished in the past by Governor Fischer, who serves as my not to assume that so I will review the basic contour of the forecast,

usual, and then proceed to touch on developments with regard to sentiment and possible revisions to the Affordable Care Act.

'Forecast Summary' exhibit, the two weeks ago-is essentially December forecast.  Although some elements of private demand to have run a little stronger than we anticipated in December, much of the of components-consumer energy services and real GDP, which was released after the January estimate of inventory investment was stronger its estimate of net exports was weaker, but especially in view of outlook in light of them. As you can see from the top two panels of your GDP projection-even taking account of the information that has become available since we sent you the January Tealbook nearly unrevised from the appear unexpected strength was in a couple motor vehicle sales-where we expect to see some near-term payback.  In the BEA's advance estimate of fourth-quarter Tealbook was closed, the top-line figure-shown by the blue dot in panel 1-was very close to our forecast.  The BEA than we expected and the preliminary and largely offsetting aspect of the surprises, we have not modified our or to our other position-depicted by the black solid line in panel 3-is also close to our December assessment.  Our point estimate is that output is medium termpercent above With no important changes to our supply-side assumptions conditioning assumptions, our judgmental view of the economy's current and prospective cyclical therefore slightly above the level of potential at present, and we continue to expect that aggregate demand will modestly outpace aggregate supply over the albeit to a diminishing degree-leaving the level of real GDP 1¾ potential at the end of 2019.

the labor market, December's employment report was very close in the job market continued to tighten revisions to our projected the unemployment rate-shown in little revised since the previous Tealbook.  At the end of 2019, the just above 4 percent, nearly 1 percentage point With regard to to our expectation and suggests that conditions gradually through the end of last year.  With only minimal output gap path, our medium-term forecast of panel 4-is also unemployment rate is expected to be below our estimate of the natural rate.

closer look at labor market developments by race or case for the aggregate unemployment rate-shown by the black rates for these various groups are now close to the just prior to the 2007-09 recession.  The differentials in jobless rates as narrow today as they became at their at the peak of the preceding business cycle, but they are not narrower. 6 plots participation rates for persons between the ages of 25 and 54.  These three Panels 5 and 6 provide a ethnicity.  As is the line in panel 5-the unemployment levels seen across these groups are approximately narrowest Panel series are more volatile than the aggregate, but the graph suggests that all groups could be experiencing a modest upturn in participation rates.

summarize the inflation outlook, which is core PCE inflation, The top two panels on the next page essentially unchanged from December.  In these panels I have again used blue dots to show the BEA's advance estimates of fourth-quarter total and

In addition, release included monthly PCE price data through report, total PCE prices rose 1.6 percent over the increased 1.7 percent over this are not shown on your exhibit. in total PCE prices to reach 2 percent ebbing to 1.8 percent around the middle of the year.

most interesting development over the intermeeting period has been in the November election.  On the household side, the Michigan index of black line in panel 9-has moved higher, on net, since and remains at a high level despite the small decline reported this least some of these changes in sentiment to have been related to the election.  In addition to the timing of the the election hypothesis is the tabulation of party affiliation, which 10.

Other indicators of 12-have also Perhaps the the sharp improvement in some measures of household and business sentiment wake of the consumer sentiment-the October.

Consumers are we expect that the Survey Research connection between political affiliation and sentiment through April of this year. the business side, the NFIB's gauge of small business confidence-panel a further business sentiment-such as the ISM indexes shown in panel improved, though not by as much.

election-related changes in sentiment don't to leave much of an imprint on consumer spending.  Admittedly, this is a bit of thin reed, as Mian and coauthors depend primarily on just two elections when the get some statistical out of those two events is by using county-level data.  Furthermore, the the Michigan measure of sentiment in the past few months appears far In our current projection, we have not built in much of a reaction to these improvements in household and business sentiment.  A recent academic paper by Mian, Sufi, and Khoshkhou suggests that appear a White House changed hands-2000 and 2008.  The way they significance jump in

different from what happened in the previous episodes, suggesting that we're in somewhat uncharted territory.

couple of caveats are in order, however.  First, it could be that the rise in the improvements in some of the relevant series in the New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations.  Second, for models that condition on measures of business sentiment have some time.  Hence, while we did boost our nearresponse to the improvement we've seen in these refrained from going very far in that direction.  Of course, we will be the recent extended further, or if we start to in the spending data.  Thus far, though, we that would lead us to second-guess jump in motor vehicle preliminary reading that we have on the election-the one for December-surprised us to the A Michigan measure is sending a misleading signal.  For example, there haven't been especially large post-election Federal Reserve Bank of business spending, our been overpredicting E&amp;I growth for term E&amp;I projection somewhat in surveys, we reevaluating both of these decisions in coming months, especially if improvements in sentiment are sustained or even see some persistent upside surprises haven't seen much in the actual spending data these decisions, with the lone exception being December's sales.  Indeed, outside of motor vehicles, the one monthly spending after downside.

to fiscal policy, as you know, the only policy change that placeholder for a more although we don't intend for that particular formulation to be taken the same one that we plugged into the December Finally, with regard we've built into the baseline forecast thus far is a expansionary fiscal policy.  For now, we're showing that expansion as a cut in personal taxes, very seriously.  This placeholder is forecast.

repeal of the Affordable Care Act.  At this point, it remains might be replaced with and on what frame.  One plausible outcome would be enactment of the ACA repeal bill that and vetoed last year.  That bill included immediate repeal of the ACAdelayed repeal of the Medicaid expansion and private insurance market subsidies. the 2016 repeal bill would to the household sector about Another item that appears to be high on the priority list of the incoming Administration and the Congress-but not incorporated into our baseline projection-is the extremely uncertain what, if anything, the ACA time was passed related taxes and regulations such as the employer and individual mandates, as well as a Drawing on CBO analysis, my colleagues estimate that have lowered taxes about $70 billion and cut transfers $120 billion, and so it would have reduced the budget deficit by roughly $50 billion.

of that bill would cause a small drag on aggregate level of real GDP about 0.2 percent after a couple of in small effects on participation and the workweek, but dip.  The 2016 bill would have little effect, we estimate, on inflation. Accordingly, enactment demand-enough to reduce the years.  It might additionally have a small positive effect on aggregate supply to the extent that the ACA subsidies had discouraged work, as the CBO analysis has suggested.  Indeed, we built aggregate movements in participation and the workweek since 2014 show no discernable

level that prevailed before the ACA.  The individual market the requirement to provide insurance to but no longer had either a mandate or subsidies to individuals to buy insurance. According to analysis by the CBO, however, enactment of the repeal bill with nothing in the way of replacement would lead to a sharp increase in the number of uninsured to above the might unravel because the repeal bill kept those with preexisting conditions entice healthier appears to be some limit that kind of an erosion in would be structured-for example, how much Steve will continue our presentation. Although the situation is obviously still very fluid, there now pressure to couple a repeal bill with provisions to coverage.  But how the replacement responsibility might be devolved to the states-is still very much up in the air.  So, for now, as far as the ACA is concerned, we haven't just done something-we've stood there.  And we think that's probably the better approach until we gain some clarification.

Thank you, David.  I'll be referring to the material titled for the foreign economies, shown in panel 1, is so little changed from that it could be described in 140 characters or less.  But because you were will proceed MR. KAMIN. 3 'Material for Briefing on the International Outlook.'

foreign real GDP growth in the rapid third-quarter pace, and we see it percent-roughly its potential rate-for the rest of the forecast outlook for the AFEs-the green line-is dragged down a bit by the U.K. economy.  EME economic growth picks up, as China's As in the previous forecast, we estimate that fourth quarter moderated from its unusually remaining near 2½ period.  The effects of Brexit on the gradual slowing is more than offset by recovery in South America.

After appreciating some 20 percent since the middle of 2014, we have the more over the next three years.  This rise increases in the federal funds rate that are much further loosening of foreign monetary policy, and more upward pressure on the dollar from that quarter.  Putting together, higher foreign growth and a flattening trajectory for the dollar net exports on U.S. real GDP growth, as shown in The outlook for the dollar, shown in panel 2, is also almost unchanged from December. broad real dollar rising only about 4 percent mainly reflects the response of markets to faster than they currently expect.  Assuming that economic growth abroad holds up as projected, we don't anticipate therefore we don't see this all translate into a diminishing drag of panel 3.

As indicated in panels 5 and 6, Mexico is highly dependent on the U.S. economy.  Exports to the United States exceed example, could lower Mexican exports by something like 8 percent of GDP.  Even taking of imported inputs, the hit to the Mexican economy would be substantial.

deeper on one earlier:  the border adjustment of corporate taxes. last year, the House Republican leadership proposed a sweeping reform of received considerable attention in recent is controversial, and its prospects are uncertain.  Nevertheless, its current prominence, I thought it would be useful to review the proposed those aspects of the proposal that In the remainder of my briefing, I would like to drill down a little of the policy options I mentioned In June of the U.S. corporate tax system, which has months.

As in border adjustment provisions would receive a rebate tax rate applied to their foreign sales. The key elements of the proposed reform are shown in panel Were reform would essentially convert value-added tax.  All sales revenues would be taxed at a rate of 20 percent.  Purchases of domestically produced inputs could be deducted from VAT systems in other countries, two so-called apply:  Corporations would not be able to deduct the cost of imported inputs from their taxable revenues, and firms exporting abroad would, in essence, equal to the

Finally, with wage deductability, exporters receive in foreign the equivalent of a substantial tariff on cash producers will be able deduct wages from will be substantial tax advantages that should improve their competiveness markets.  All told, the tax proposal provides imports and a subsidy on exports.

the border adjustment measures, the House Republican proposal contains eliminates the deductibility of interest expenses, and of all capital expenses.  For this briefing, will set aside those essentially domestic provisions and focus on the articles by the border adjustment tax will not affect activity, or interest rates-it will merely rationalize the tax boost revenues.  Their rationale is that the dollar will strengthen by just rise in import tariffs and export subsidies implied by the prove no costlier, and exports no more profitable, to be based on an unrealistic determination in which the dollar automatically adjusts to trade balance constant.  In the real world, we would indeed expect the border of taxes to push the dollar upward but not necessarily by the exact amount we would adjustment tax to generate significant changes in trade, Besides two other general provisions:  It it allows for the immediate deductibility however, I consequences of the border adjustment measures.  You may have read prominent fiscal economists arguing that U.S. trade, economic system and enough to offset the effective new tax system so that imports will than they were before.  This argument, however, appears model of exchange rate keep the adjustment required to offset that tax adjustment.  And at least partly for that reason, also expect the border economic activity, and interest rates.

flesh out this issue, we traced through the effects of the border adjustment tax We assume the border adjustment tax is imposed to evaluate the effect of lowering the current 35 percent level to 20 percent.  We are also setting panel 9-fall, exports real GDP and inflation increase, and the federal funds rate-panel 14-must be border adjustment tax.  Most of the initial of that tax eventually are unwound, but the process takes there are significant consequences for the To in our general equilibrium model. in isolation-that is, we are not attempting corporate tax from its aside the additional provisions for capital expenses and interest payments.  As shown by the solid blue lines in panels 9 through 15, imports-that's rise, adjusted up accordingly.  In consequence, the dollar appreciates, as shown in panel 15, but by less than the extent of the macroeconomic effects several years.  And in the meantime, economy and monetary policy.

may still be imposed on from selected countries.  To provide some basis for lines in these panels show the effects of a comparable hike in GDP and interest rates is Even if a border adjustment tax is not enacted, tariff hikes selected products or on imports comparison, the red import tariffs alone.  With no subsidies going to exports in this experiment, exports fall in response to the higher dollar, and the uplift to real smaller.  Note that neither of these simulations assume retaliatory action by our trading partners, which would weigh heavily on economic activity and trade. Andreas will now continue our presentation.

Line 3 shows funds' holdings of repurchase with banks and other private entities, much of which, of course, is These rose modestly.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  The floor is open for questions for any of our presenters. CHAIR President Kaplan.

I just want to make you assuming that U.S. exporters will be able to lower their prices to be more competitive overseas? MR. KAPLAN.  Steve, can I go back to this border tax in box 10? sure I understand it.  The reason, in the border-tax case, why exports go up-are implicitly the export subsidy that is corporate tax system lowers their cost and, thus, allows them toMR. KAMIN.  Yes, that is indeed the assumption, because basically implied by the

Yes, exactly.  So they can pass it on, and they can sell more. MR. KAMIN.

MR. KAMIN.  It's partially offset.

MR. KAPLAN.  But not completely.

MR. KAMIN.  But it's not completely offset.

MR. KAPLAN.  And then the reason in the tariff case that exports decline is- tariff.  But the tariff, by basically raising real GDP and inflation, and improving MR. KAMIN.  Is because in the tariff case, there is no export subsidy.  There is only the imposition of the the trade balance leads to a rise in the dollar.

Okay, thank you.

MR. KAPLAN.  I see.

MR. KAMIN.  That rise in the dollar depresses exports.

MR. KAPLAN.  Got it.

MR. BULLARD.  But it doesn't

First, as shown in panel 15, the dollar does immediately respond. increase enough.

If it did increase fully to offset the border adjustment tax, and if to be built into our system-it takes time for trade is some time involved in producers changing prices, and so on.  If those rigidities full amount, then you would get no change in the MR. KAMIN.  Exactly. there weren't some other rigidities that happen to adjust, there were not present, and if the dollar went the macroeconomic variables.  And that was the argument that was made by various economists in blogs and newspaper articles and whatnot.

the world that would prevent the theoretical adjustment from occurring. MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  So these are pictures of the rigidities that you think are prevalent in let's put it this way.  The model incorporates rigidities and adjustment that would take place in a perfect general equilibrium, flex-price solution. MR. KAMIN.  Yes.  Well, other factors that we think would prevent the foresight,

that- MR. POTTER.  But it has some factors in it as well

-oil is priced in dollars, things like that. MR. POTTER.

MR. KAMIN.  What's that?

There are some factors like that.  In our model, as I have discussed with some of those factors aren't built in.  But let me pick up on Simon's point.  In in which the dollar immediately jumps the full amount of the border adjustment macro variables, that change in the dollar by itself introduces MR. KAMIN. our modelers, rarified models tax so there are no changes in any

January 31-February 1, 2017

effects and very substantial balance sheet effects that indeed might be economic activity. very substantial wealth expected to affect some fairly advanced modeling of what's basically a steady state with an unchanged macroeconomy.  In our case, that through other rigidities, but it is also true that changes in the dollar alone can the way that Now, those particular financial effects are not actually built into our general equilibrium model anyway.  I suppose they could be.  That would require the kind that we are developing, and that would be another reason why you wouldn't get the instant jump to we generate generate financial effects that would, again, prevent adjustment immediately in some fiscal economists have suggested.

a border tax here.  So if they react in a certain symmetric way or MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  And just to be clear, now, you've got no reaction of foreign economies to the imposition of something, could that offset what's shown in these pictures?

In our model, foreign economies do respond with monetary policy types of policy reaction functions that we have. MR. KAMIN.  Right. tools using the same

MR. BULLARD.  But not through tariffs and-

Exactly.  But they do not retaliate via tariffs or taxes.  If they did, that the short-run benefits of these measures to the United It is worth getting a little bit more specific.  Let's put it this way, if we impose a tariff for us.  And that takes our on real GDP, and immediately makes it MR. KAMIN. could, indeed, significantly diminish States. and they impose a retaliatory tariff, that is very clearly a negative tariff hike, which has some short-run positive effects negative.

done this, but I think things get a little bit more complicated if you think We haven't about whether, in response to our border adjustment tax, they actually retaliate with their border

January 31-February 1, 2017

tax.  The reason I say it's a little bit more complicated is because the border taxes actually involve subsidies as well as tariffs.  And so a subsidy war actually the implication of global fiscal expansion, whichadjustment adjustment could have

them. MR. KAMIN.  Some do, but they could enhance it's on a different topic. MR. BULLARD.  I have another question, but

we complete questions on this topic. CHAIR YELLEN.  How about

Okay. MR. BULLARD.

Vice Chairman Dudley, you had a two-hander on this. Yes.  One thing I just wanted to add.  This is all about think about tourism.  You move the dollar up by 15 percent, the attractiveness of foreign tourism goes up-so there that are going to adjust, not just in the goods market or in the markets.  There is also a services sector. CHAIR YELLEN.  And I know, VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. goods.  What about services?  I attractiveness of U.S. tourism goes down, the is a whole bunch of other things financial is a real this would even be legal under the WTO.  How does that actually work? border adjustment tax, and then some countries said, 'We want to take to the WTO,' then don't you have to wait something like three years? The question I want to ask you about on this is, my understanding is that there question about whether If you implemented the this

I've heard for how long the litigation would take is five MR. KAMIN.  Well, the number years.

DUDLEY.  Five years?  So essentially it would be a time. VICE CHAIRMAN fait accompli for a long

January 31-February 1, 2017

should say that it's an open question In principle, wage deductions are not allowed as part of systems under the WTO. MR. KAMIN.  I think it could indeed be, yes.  I whether this violates WTO rules at all. VAT

taxes.'  We're not lawyers in an open issue.  But the point is, even if the WTO decided it and other countries sued us, I think it would take quite a while to award MR. KAMIN.  Exactly.  If the United States said, 'Well, we're implementing a VAT because that's an excellent practice, and we're also cutting payroll our division, but anyway, I think it's was not permissible them.

Okay. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

President Lacker. CHAIR YELLEN.  Were there other questions on this?

confused about something involving the exchange with rarified case in which the equilibrium reaction of the dollar is 20 percent it you've got a handle on what it would take to do impediments, some costs, and those to me sounded like costly time, which would have led me to dollar line to get to 20 percent over time.  I must be missing some other rigidity that permanently impedes the achievement of that result. MR. LACKER.  I was a little President Bullard.  This and completely offsets real effects-I take that.  And you talked about some adjustments, the kinds of things whose effect would fade over expect your blue in the way you think about things understand that some in how we make the sausage, so I will proceed. MR. KAMIN.  Sure.  I was hoping to avoid getting into this, but I people are interested

the economics of that. MR. LACKER.  I'm interested in

January 31-February 1, 2017

Our model is a perfect-foresight model.  And so what that means is in the absence of any of these rigidities, if we basically implemented the border adjustment fully permanent hike in tariffs and increase in subsidies that would stay that way forever, the full amount of the border adjustment tax.  And the unrealistic outcome that I was maligning earlier.  We think that in foreign currency don't really have a clearly view as to what an equilibrium many years down the road will be, and we don't view perfect foresight. MR. KAMIN.  Yes. that tax as a indeed, in that model, the dollar would jump you would actually have the real world, market participants who trade established that as a very strong attractor of the currency.  And we view the real world as not being subject to a way that is responsive to that concern.  The border reduction over time in both the border tax and the export subsidy, which is not substantive over the first few years.  It just lowers it by a few percentage points, but it is enough to unwind the perfect-foresight gravity that otherwise pulls the currency to We implemented the simulation in tax and subsidy do not stay absolutely constant and permanent forever.  Instead, there is a very gradual particularly basically that longer-run level.

MR. LACKER.  And why did you do that?

the perfect foresight assumption and a tax gave you a highly unrealistic outcome, and the best way to the genuine uncertainty that in the real world agents would have about where the initial policy. MR. KAMIN.  Because the combination of permanent border adjustment proxy for currency would go and to what extent trade balance considerations would push the currency would just be to introduce this very, very gradual degradation of the

January 31-February 1, 2017

DUDLEY. Are there any models that actually try to build in the VICE CHAIRMAN financial side to figure out what happens to the relative value of foreign assets and domestic assets and solve it?

at MR. KAMIN.  Well, we are developing those, but they are certainly not in the stage which they could be applied to this particular example.

But that's what you would want, ideally. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

MR. KAMIN.  Yes.

You both backed away from perfect foresight and you didn't introduce it You made it a slowlyMR. LACKER. as a permanent change.

MR. KAMIN.  Well, no, we kept the perfect foresight but made the shock a little less permanent.

MR. LACKER.  Oh, I see.  So you did that in order to simulate less-than-perfect foresight?

in order to simulate a situation in the real world in which MR. KAMIN.  Yes.  Well, agents don't have a clear sense of exactly where the exchange rate would be going over time.

WILCOX.  It's probably also worth mentioning that, Bill, we do expect some very to line up in opposition to the enactment ofMR. powerful constituencies

DUDLEY.  The retail sector, in particular, is quite geared up. VICE CHAIRMAN

example, an issue with the tax would be in a position of having zero tax liability. MR. WILCOX.  Yes.  And they are not the only ones.  For would be that exporters

DUDLEY.  Well, they would have negative taxVICE CHAIRMAN

January 31-February 1, 2017

liability under the version of the bill that was refundable, so the Treasury wouldn't be writing exporters, but they would be in a position of paying no taxes forevermore. MR. WILCOX.  Well, negative tax introduced by Brady and Ryan.  It would not be checks to a lot of taxes, they'd get the straight amount. MR. KAMIN.  And if they were combined with other companies that had then it would be like

One of my colleagues had the interesting observation rise to an incentive for Wal-Mart to merge with Boeing.  [Laughter] MR. WILCOX.  Yes.  That's right. that this would give

MR. TARULLO.  There's your synergy.

YELLEN.  Okay.  I've got President Rosengren and then President Kashkari CHAIR afterward.

My question is for Andreas.  It's in exhibit 1, 'Spread of Rate at Origination to Treasury Yield.'  I'm just wondering whether that is the rates for commercial real estate, they moved, they tend to move like a 1 percent decline in that measure.  But I that's because Treasury yields went up, not because there was a big movement in real estate prices.  And, in fact, much of this movement seems to be driven by the most useful way to determine valuation in the commercial real estate market. MR. ROSENGREN. Capitalization most relevant comparison, because when I think about cap are very slow moving.  And when I think of how Treasury yields have very quickly.  If you look at December, it looks think commercial Treasury yields rather than commercial real estate valuations.  So I just wonder whether you think this is being easy to grasp, easy to present, and in terms of what actually happened to the level of the cap I was interested to see that it actually ticked down in December.  For whatever reason, rents increases we saw then. MR. LEHNERT.  This has the notable value of also telling the right story.  So, first, rate, weren't keeping pace with the price

January 31-February 1, 2017

depth at commercial real estate but, let's say, in a richer fashion.  And the upshot of all of that is that It really does feel that in a lot of markets and for certain are paying over the odds in terms of their history.  It's not as extreme as it with maybe the late '90s in terms of valuation pressure. A bunch of our colleagues here have looked in more valuations and are actually trying to incorporate fundamentals such as vacancy rates, rent growth, and interest rates valuation pressures are notable in CRE. property types, people got in 2005 and 2006, but it's on par

It looks pretty It's putting about a 15 percent probability on a less than 3 percent unemployment and almost no probability on a more than 6 percent unemployment rate.

We're using confidence bands around this, which are 70 percent confidence intervals. If you look at this band, I'm wondering how comfortable we shows 70 percent symmetric. rate what we should do as the unemployment rate goes down.

We do sure that the model's confidence intervals don't in their characteristics too awfully far from the others.  I was going to call on either Dave or that the FRB/US model's confidence intervals are a the actual judgmental track record has been. MR. BULLARD.  And so could we MR. WILCOX.  Well, to paraphrase the line from the is, Kemosabe.  [Laughter]  We provide you with these confidence intervals that are shown in the Tealbook, but for purposes of putting together the kinds of exhibits own preference here cross-check them against one another to make stray Jeremy Rudd.  In general, my impression is little narrower than question that you're getting at is actually not the FRB/US or by the Tealbook errors, because what you're getting at is an conditional on being at 4 percent unemployment. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  I think the addressed by either issue called 'state contingent' confidence intervals.  So David's asymmetry would apply.  What you see in the Tealbook would apply if the unemployment rate was 7 percent.  They've got a sample skewness there, but it's not

way either, partly because the way it's run is that it economy is any different the unemployment rate is at 5 percent or 6 percent or 4 percent.  But there is a literature In FRB/US, that's not computed that doesn't think that the errors or the shocks or that the mechanism of the whether

FRB/US model, it's all shocks.  But in the Tealbook the actual errors that were made over history. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  In the errors, it's everything that could go wrong-it's and you run into somebody like that.  In my mind, I always as, well, I've either got a model that I like or don't like.  That's parameter two from now things happen, like trying to explain championship game because the running back got taken out of the game.  I MR. EVANS.  Because I'm sure we've all been out in public and they say, 'Oh, you are terrible at forecasting,' right?  Things think of this uncertainty.  And then, of course, a year or why Alabama lost the

this major move in equity about 8 or 9 percent, so I was really eager to get my financial stability memo, gets debated extent to which this represents a warranted revision of the fundamentals the extent of your equity moves have outstripped the move in fundamentals. MR. LACKER.  Thank you.  Since the election, there's been values, and it's because that's where I was figuring I could count on an assessment of this thing that in the press, which is the underlying dividend growth or not.  And I was a little disappointed by discussion of that question.  I was happy there was an interesting box in the Tealbook about dividend growth projections.  That seemed informative.  But I was yearning to hear you tell us [laughter] whether

Could you help me with this, Now, there was something in there about historical percentiles, and that got me well, maybe when you say valuation pressures, I should just take that as a statistical term about historical things even though things change in the future.  And maybe the warranted even though it's out Andreas?

Some reduction is being reflected in the market-who knows how it's probably a good bet that some of it is. MR. KAPLAN.  I hate to maybe hasn't been talked about enough.  The mean estimates of the value, right or wrong, of a corporate tax reduction, even to 25 percent, are about $126 and take that of that increase from a corporate tax much, but

MR. KAPLAN.  Of course.  But it just gives you a sense of-for people running models, which people on the buy-side do-that's the best estimate I've heard that people have congealed around.

it makes it seem plausible. MR. LACKER.  So

MR. KAPLAN.  Yes.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman.

DUDLEY.  Yes, thank you.  First of all, I want to thank Steve for border adjustment tax issue.  This is a really consequential piece of legislation, and if actually enacted, it would have really big implications for how we think about the world in the world to look at this, but this is a really big deal if it were to actually pass. VICE CHAIRMAN tackling the it were on this Committee.  So I hope that you keep digging into this even though we don't have the greatest models there was a comment about the Michigan survey in terms We were quite interested in that, so we took a look at the implications New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations.  We don't capture Instead we looked at if you're a Republican county, if you're a Democratic Second, I just want to say that of the political affiliation. for our own survey, the political affiliation.

It went down in the Democratic an effect because counties aren't a person, but it very much University of Michigan.

discussion, you passed over the If you did get rid of the deductibility of interest, how are we thinking Because I remember the Tax Reform Act of '86, which changed the depreciation substantially and had huge consequences for real estate.  What do we think would in a big way, and are there things we should be And, finally, I had a question for Andreas.  In the border deductibility of interest. about that? rules quite happen if we got rid of the deductibility of interest and we started to think about that?  Are there instances in which relative prices would change nervous about?

that goes through to actually eliminate the mortgage It does seem that house prices would fall as a result. MR. LEHNERT.  Yes-I mean, if interest deduction.  Of course, also, the mortgage interest deduction becomes less valuable as you cut personal income tax rates.

DUDLEY.  I was thinking more on the corporate side. VICE CHAIRMAN

the size of the change in house prices. MR. LEHNERT.  Yes, but house prices are, from a stability perspective, quite a big deal. And I should also advertise my colleague David Rappoport's recent working paper on this topic, which gives some estimates of services industry, you of those areas in which there is a private desire to maintain leverage.  But, is a social cost-and, of course, there is also the deadweight cost engineering is the most On the corporate side, the deductibility of interest is one of those wedges between the public and private cost of debt.  In principle, especially for the financial ought to eliminate one again, a foregone tax revenue of a higher-leveraged system.  Now, I don't think at this point that the tax

January 31-February 1, 2017

important determinant of financial firms' credit structure.  I think regulations and so forth are the driver there.

that's the sort of thing that It does seem that the most are the ones that have or anticipate having the biggest feel like the credit cycle on the corporate side seems to have Then looking at the nonfinancial sector, it does seem like might take a little bit of gas off the fire of corporate borrowing. corporations that are borrowing the growth in their cash flows.  So it seems like a betting on expansion rather than, again, financial engineering.  And, again, it does slowed notably in the past few quarters.

DUDLEY.  It seems like removing the deductibility of interest more stable, right, because you'd have less incentive to take on the system.  But there'd be some big adjustment costs as you move to the new VICE CHAIRMAN would actually make the system a lot of leverage in equilibrium.

DUDLEY.  Thank you. VICE CHAIRMAN

MR. LEHNERT.  Yes, exactly.

YELLEN.  Any further questions?  We now have an opportunity to comment on stability, and a few people have indicated a desire to do so.  Let's turn to that next, CHAIR financial starting with President Rosengren.

Home Loan Banks are increasingly funding illiquid real estate assets as well.  Money market funds now hold over 50 percent of the debt issued by Home Loan Banks, up from 30 percent in 2014, and the Federal Home Loan Banks with the weakest reported capital ratios have been some of the most aggressive issuers of MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The QS report did a nice job of highlighting that Federal with short-term borrowing from government money market funds, and Andreas covered that a bit in his presentation Federal some of

We here have considerable in the large part of the financial system that we supervise, but we do not regulators in many other countries have to set loan-to-value or debton mortgages, or both.  Because major financial crises frequently financing, this is an important problem.

after the start of the great financial crisis, international negotiations over element of the regulatory system, the risk weighting of bank-held assets, remains under the differences in risk weights assigned to the same asset by different there should be a substantial role for a standard set of risk in calculating risk-weighted assets.

So what's going on?  And should we worry about sharp reversal? observations.

I think the markets are doing well in spite of greater uncertainty, because I think risk of a near-term U.S. recession has dropped.  And because of the consistent with this notion that Simon talked First, there's a perception that the perception that the prospect of political gridlock in Washington has diminished, the sharp narrowing that we saw in high-yield OAS spreads is about, that recession risks have diminished in the near term.

international outlook does appear to have improved somewhat, even in the growth rate in the last quarter.  We've had a recovery in prices.  The dollar has appreciated, which we think is important because it removes of the deflationary pressure on Europe and Japan.  And I have been surprised that Brexit sterling.  So a lot of the things that we were worried about haven't to be supportive for greater optimism. I also think that the though there was a downshift commodity some has not had really bad consequences, at least yet, for U.K. economic performance beyond the weakness that we see in materialized, and so that seems

Economic data since the December have come in close is for growth of around 2 percent, job creation gradually slowing-but still above trend labor force growth-and inflation moving up ever closer to 2 percent.

Housing prices are rising steadily and five years averaging 0.5 percent, now estimated at nearly 1 percent, an increase that is small and but nonetheless welcome.  Taken together, these factors should provide ample Consumer and business surveys remain upbeat. equity prices have also continued to move up.  After productivity for 2016 is preliminary support for the economy, the labor market, and inflation moving along the path I described.

The Committee has been quite patient, and that the risks are now two sided, and the pace of tightening will need to react risk of falling 'behind the curve.' The baseline forecast extended period.

Such an approach need not go too far in the opposite direction and emphasize only the

one factor that will be important to watch:  labor force participation, which bit more room for with measured participation bouncing around between 62½ and other secular factors my assumption is that some of the bouncing around is really a function of participation has been about flat. I'll mention has shown welcome and unexpected strength, suggesting along the way a growth.  We've now had three years and 63 percent and remaining, overall, about flat despite demographic pushing down trend participation.  Since the labor market has been steadily improving through this period, measurement, and the reality is that should we take from this?  Over the three-year the flat participation rate means that we've picked up about a full percentage point a matter of arithmetic, much of remaining in the labor force rather than the reentry of weight of opinion today seems to be that labor force participation is its long-time downward trend.  And I want to push back on that just a at all because I'm sure that it's wrong, but rather because I think there remains a good flat for a while longer or even move back up again. In any case, the question is, what signal period, against the declining trend, and, as many have pointed out, as that has been due to more people discouraged workers.  The likely to soon resume little-not chance that participation will remain

This is plausible and would suggest a more room for growth.  In addition, participation has moved up 50 basis points or so above late in the past couple of cycles, so it is not at all clear that we're about to The bottom line is, since high frequency movements in participation may well be noisy, I wouldn't react too much to short-term changes in either and sustained change. The canonical paper by Stephanie Aaronson and various others here the Cleveland Federal Reserve participation after a significant lag, rate bit our estimate of trend hit a wall on participation. and unemployment direction until we see a clear it.  We can't stop aging, but, at least in principle, the decline in participation by primecan address the problem.

More recently, Alan Krueger and others those at the labor force, most of the policies that would target declining the Congress and the Administration, not in force and possibly headline around until we see a clear change in signal.  Thank you, Madam Chair. A final point.  Some of the downward trend in labor force participation is inevitable, but not all of age males need not be taken as a given, like death and taxes.  Depending on the underlyng causes, various policies report have suggested that poor health plays a role.  While a tight labor market could help margin remain connected to the participation by prime-age males are in the hands of our hands.  But, again, I would avoid overreacting as labor unemployment move

And I think Governor Powell was alluding to the to surprise to the downside, or it doesn't get passed at all, could be some retrenchment from the upsurge in business and household sentiment as Now, I have to say that if you go on the basis of history-that is to say, the 1981 and 2001 episodes-it's quite possible that deficit concerns will end up taking a for around.  Even if it is something likely be in 2018 and beyond, although obviously there anticipatory possibility that if the package were there reflected in increased asset values that we've seen since the election.

Looking only at the U.S. economy, I but I continue to think it's too early to incorporate some assumption of these risks being realized into baseline expectations.

In light about the economy and risks, this argument does seem to me less policy would face particular challenges responding to such a Great Recession, when interest rates are still low of what I said earlier compelling than it was even six months ago.

we should be cautious as part of a self-conscious to increase the resilience of the economy to a significant shock by continuing to provide of our current limited capacity for increased accommodation.

Of course, in the resiliency through some brakes.  As the staff paper discussed in a previous meeting showed, history doesn't provide particularly strong guidance in trying to do so, except insofar lucky.  I somewhat differently.

There are two reasons I say that.  One observation in her remarks that she had wide bands around her expectations, just because there is so much uncertainty.  But another reason for that is, with the been asked by several people about in 2011.  Not having remembered in some cases what those things were, I read the transcripts, and so I ended up reading more of our intended to.

And, as I looked at what everybody was saying, at the time much perfectly reasonable and a decent extrapolation from what One of the big discussions for several meetings in 2011 was whether structural factors were going to place a years ago.  This is the conversation we were having when unemployment was, what, about 8 percent, I think, at the of what was said would have seemed we were seeing, but in retrospect it all looks kind of misguided.

that just reinforces the wisdom of kind of taking it step by step, not some set of past correlations, but reasons many of you have said, I think we the things that right now look somewhat uncertain.

VICE CHAIRMAN see those investment bottom suggesting that we can be lulled by the trajectory that we're on sort of permanence associated with creates a pattern everybody else in that I see the economic outlook as little changed since our meeting.

the large improvement in household and business sentiment post-election, I really quite significant, and I think there's a lot of uncertainty about how to interpret a harbinger of a pickup in the growth pace, or not?

turns out that the process of store closings unfolds quite slowly, for the major department store chains.  He said that it takes typically a year or so, on closing the store. the store is open, it's fully staffed, it's not like it tapers down to the closing operating.  So all of these store closing announcements are to actually play out.

I think it's really time to get our

In light of this, I believe we should be taking steps to remove accommodation months ahead.  And while I believe it's appropriate to stand pat for today, I also believe if the economy progresses as I expect, it will be appropriate to remove some amount of I believe we're making good progress on reaching our dual-mandate objectives.

I believe not moving in March may restrict our options for orchestrating the gradual and patient removal of accommodation.  So if

It isn't clear to me that we are have a strong view, but I want to see more data that we've used up labor market OMB is right-maybe there are another million workers who want to reenter just like to see more data before reaching a conclusion.

January 31-February 1, 2017

I have several comments.  First, we shouldn't get fooled if our first-quarter GDP growth of a residual seasonality that's shown up in the past several years.  For the past the Tealbook has revised down its real-time first-quarter forecasts between the history repeats itself and our first-quarter forecasts shift economy is stalling or as a reason for regard, forecasts fall between now and March.  As I pointed out yesterday, such a decline is a predictable aspect three years, January and March meetings.  So if downward a bit, we should not take that as a signal that the policy delay.

comments of President Mester.  Lack of is not a reason to delay normalization in March.  It's likely to be some time we have clarity about the size, timing, and composition of fiscal stimulus.  But, as funds rate path in 2018 and 2019 rather than this year.  So I think we can and the progress we have made on our objectives and not have to look regarding what fiscal and other policies will be in order to make another policy move. Second, here I'm going to echo some of the fiscal policy clarity before demonstrated by the Tealbook alternative scenarios, a larger or smaller stimulus would mainly affect the appropriate focus on the actual data for clarity

I'm echoing President Kaplan's remarks verbatim-I'm not used to argument in favor of a March rate increase is to preserve our policy the appropriate policy rate path turns out to require, say, just two or three year, starting out early gives us the flexibility to do that.  And if the data achieve a more gradual path by not having in the year.  However, if the data suggest greater overshooting of full inflation associated with more positive developments in the economy, or increases-then we'll be glad that we remained March.  Thank you. Finally, here I think going this late-another optionality.  So even if funds rate increases this surprise on the downside later on, well, we'll just more rate hikes later employment, higher maybe fiscal stimulus-and, say, we need four on the path of gradually raising rates in

In light of normalization of the whether, as a consequence, it will be appropriate that will bring about a cessation of reinvestments on the size of the balance sheet from month to month, and the likely appropriate of the balance sheet in the post-crisis 'new normal' will all be valuable in helping public well in advance of any decision and minimizing the risks of excessive occurring when the decision occurs.

DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as from the December meeting.  A move at this inconsistent with our 'gradual path' fully appropriate.  However, I think we do have to consider current market expectations are consistent with the likelihood of a March move and expectations in the direction we desire.  I concluded-and I think view as well-that, as written, alt-B is very neutral and is unlikely to shift VICE CHAIRMAN written.  The outlook hasn't changed materially meeting would be a huge surprise, and it would also be messaging.  So alt-B seems to be whether the whether alternative B will shift this is Thomas's expectations upward.

a March move into the financial markets than we currently have-there's only about a 20 or 25 percent a March move.  Raising that probability also seems consistent with the sentiments about people's own views of the likelihood of moving in March. I also conclude that we probably want a somewhat higher probability of priced probability of I heard around the table low to me, in light of the fact that the economy to full employment, and fact that financial conditions-even though individual components have been moving around few months ago.
