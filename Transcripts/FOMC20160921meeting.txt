effort to develop proposed revisions to the Authorization for Foreign Currency Foreign Currency Directive, and other related documents.  You all received the proposal from the staff in mid-August, and last week we sent a short additional Foreign Currency Subcommittee.  This project has required a lot of careful from both the New York Federal Reserve and the Board.  That work was Subcommittee, and I'd like to thank the staff for to me to be an excellent proposal.  In my view, it meets the important objectives of That takes us to the second agenda item, which concerns proposed revisions of the documents governing foreign currency operations.  As you know, the staff has been engaged in a long-term Operations, the memos on memo from the analysis involving staff carried out under the general oversight of the what seems the project.

And I very thorough and excellent review of these things. MR. LACKER.  As many of you know, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond has a long tradition of raising concerns they're sterilized, they're meaningless.  If they're not sterilized, they imply a change in monetary policy stance, which would imply some compromise of our the Treasury. Federal Reserve has dissented on anything having to do with foreign exchange authorizations.  I mention this, first, to avoid disappointing those who might have been expecting me to mention this any time a foreign exchange strike me commend the staff on a rate peg, we had to sterilize them, so they were kind of meaningless.  If we didn't rate down.  Nowadays, it's not obvious that they should be to give that more thought and maybe give some thought to the role played by ourforeign More broadly, though, foreign exchange operations increasingly seem to be an anachronistic tool.

First, we would reduce the Federal Reserve's minimum net from the minimum Tier 1 capital for the new NRC threshold. Third, capital thresholds. The FRBNY relies on primary dealers not only for the operations, but also to ensure robust coverage of Treasury auctions of new securities. We propose modestly expand the pool of regulated banks and broker-dealers eligible primary dealers in an summarized in regulatory capital, or NRC, threshold for broker-dealers to $50 million current $150 million level.  Second, we would increase the threshold to $1 billion to better align and scale it we would establish a 0.25 percent Treasury market share threshold to accompany the new minimum reducing the minimum NRC threshold to $50 million is likely to effect on the number of primary dealers in the near term, as impact analysis was based on an examination of the NRC in excess of as of year-end 2014, and are not already primary dealers.  Of those 168, act as market makers in Treasury securities.  And 13 of these of the current $150 million threshold, leaving to apply at the new $50 million I would note that have a fairly modest shown in panel 3.  Our 168 broker-dealers that are registered with the SEC, had $50 million only 25 appeared to 25 firms already had NRC in excess only 12 additional dealers that would become eligible NRC threshold.

As shown in panel 4, Treasury market share has in the used as a gauge of primary dealer capabilities. 2015, the Desk conducted two yearlong pilot programs with small firms, first as participants purchase operations.

Indeed, as you will see from the path line, our judgmental assessment is that the rebound has been a little time of the July meeting, even taking on board last retail sales release.

Thus far, the call not right one.  In 2017 and 2018, a variety of very small factors have caused us cumulative 0.1 percentage point per year out of our projection.

In relative terms, conditions on improving more rapidly of late for African terms, labor market Americans and Hispanics. I will now turn to reviewing the comparative African Americans, Hispanics or Latinos, and whites over the past couple of decades. A high-level summary is that overall labor improve over the past several years, and that broadly shared across at least some dimensions have been Americans and Hispanics than for whites.  However, in absolute conditions remain notably worse for African

The following three panels illustrate conditions.  As shown by the black dashed line in panel 9, the national unemployment rate has other lines, this is true for of limit the influence of the marked differences in age structure racial and ethnic groups.  The EPOPs for all groups have trended up over the years, with the EPOP for blacks or African Americans making especially the Great Recession recovery experienced by other groups. As shown in panel 10, the broader U-6 measure has also generally continued to trend downward, though progress on this measure appears to have been more uneven in recent months for blacks and Hispanics.  Panel 11 shows employment-topopulation ratios for these same groups, focusing here on persons between the ages 25 and 54 in order to across past several notable gains after having suffered especially severely during and having lagged the

Starting with the most this point, the unemployment rates for blacks and Hispanics example, 8.7 percent, on average, for Hispanics, and rates are higher for blacks and Hispanics than they are for whites. Thus, the labor improved considerably during the past few years.  That said, in many respects obvious fact to illustrate remain much higher than that for whites.  For blacks over the 12 months ending in August, 5.9 percent for 4.4 percent for whites.  Moreover, panel 12 on your next page shows that, at every age, unemployment for Hispanics at every level of educational attainment are higher than they are sobering take on the Similarly, panel 13 shows that, with only one exception, unemployment rates blacks and for whites of the same educational attainment.

One prominent author has suggested that much of the blacks and Hispanics can be attributed to the disproportionate and Hispanics in the highly cyclical manufacturing and it might reflect different age structures or and ethnic groups. An obvious question is blacks and Hispanics high-beta experience of employment of blacks construction industries.  Another prominent author has attributed the phenomenon to discrimination.  A third possibility is that levels of educational attainment across racial as an stratified the scatter plots by level of educational attainment.

The remaining panels perform the same exercise counterintuitive result here is that is no attenuation of the high-beta experience as education goes up:  Even for a college degree, if the unemployment rate of their white counterparts data point furthest to the northeast in this panel-that is, the In that year, the unemployment rate for whites with a peaked at 3.9 percent, while the rate for their black counterparts hit page show the results for blacks.

Recent of ECB and Bank of Japan policies have often focused on whether and policymakers in both have been surprised by the extent to which long yields have fallen and, as their effects on bank profits.

The sovereign debt holdings are still its holdings of any bond and any issuer, its purchases are allocated across than its deposit each other and become more binding when bond a large share of its 25 percent), but many German bonds yield less than the deposit rate not eligible.  We expect the ECB to announce, most likely in December, to relax some of those constraints, and it has In addition to low rates, all ongoing asset purchase discussions how to expand these purchases.  Regarding 'whether,' institutions I noted earlier, are concerned about both institutions are facing issues and constraints as their asset ECB's constraints are largely self-imposed, as its only a small share of outstanding euro-area sovereign debt.  In particular, the ECB limits countries by its capital key, and it buys only bonds that yield more rate.  These constraints interact with yields decline.  For instance, German bonds have to make up purchases (about and thus are an extension of its purchases to the end of 2017 from its current commitment of March 2017.

As shown in panel 3, it currently holds more than one-third of outstanding JGBs.  Moreover, Japanese life insurance companies and pension funds have longterm yen-denominated liabilities and thus are elevated prices.  Of course, large fiscal deficits are also JGBs, and the Abe government has announced renewed fiscal stimulus.  We expect the BOJ to maintain not to increase that pace.

Compared with the shown in the bottom panel, 12 of you revised down the expect to prevail at the end of this year; the median of your is now 25 basis points lower.  All but a couple of you revised down your the next two years, and, since June, many of you also lowered appropriate pace of rate hikes in 2017.  The median federal 75 basis point increase expected in June, and by another several years will need to be gradual in light of a short-term that is currently low and will only rise slowly-a factors.  In addition, some of you cited risk-management considerations,due the proximity of the effective lower bound, as a reason for taking a cautious Exhibit 3 provides an overview of your assessments of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate.

Thereafter, the 1.9 percent June projections, which are federal funds rate you projections funds rate forecast over your assessment of the funds rate projection moves up 50 basis points from the end of 2016 to the end of 2017, compared with a 75 basis points in 2018.  Many of you expressed a view that increases in the federal funds rate over the next neutral real interest rate phenomenon that a number of you attributed to persistently low productivity growth and other to approach to normalization.

As in that the appropriate level of the funds rate at the end judgments of its longer-run level.  Most of this difference to narrow considerably by the end of 2019. With respect projections compared with 3 percent in June.  In making the downward revisions, participants noted a number of factors, including the persistence of unfavorable global demographic dynamics; stemming from, for example, a weak outlook for economic June, almost all of you anticipate of 2018 will remain below your individual you expect median federal funds rate that a for the end of this year,conditional on your of core inflation, the unemployment rate gap, and the longerfunds rate, has shifted down since June, reflecting downward revisions to revisions rule prescriptions for 2017 and 2018 the downward revisions to the longer-run federal funds rate.

The lower Taylor primarily reflect you continue to project are well below the prescriptions using your individual economic outlooks as variables in the policy rule, and only two of you project the federal funds rate equal to that suggested by the rule.

YELLEN.  Questions for any of the presenters are welcome.  Governor Brainard. CHAIR

for David Wilcox.  I thought the groups was interesting.  It seems very important as we try to figure out where we are with regard MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  This is discussion and the decomposition on unemployment experiences by different racial extremely to remaining slack and where that remaining slack may be, although it's a little unclear as to why there are these very differential experiences.

it, I thought the decomposition by education was very striking, both in terms terms of the levels.  And, as you were talking, it seems a little harder a pattern with sectoral differences as opposed to potentially like discrimination.  But I wondered whether you had any further on what this is telling you so far or what additional analysis you might think about to get further insights into that. As I look at of the variability and in superficially to associate that kind of alternative explanations thoughts doing to try a really important question to be investigated.  As I said in I don't regard this work as having laid to rest the question.  I'm a skeptical that differential exposure to cyclical industries-in particular, manufacturing and the high-beta experience of blacks and Hispanics.  My view on is informed importantly by the results, perhaps most especially those in the lower-right panel with a bachelor's degree or more, this to whites.  I haven't looked at the industry exposure of African MR. WILCOX.  I think it's the course of the briefing itself, little construction-can account for that in exhibit 16, which show that even for African Americans multiplier of 1.8 pertains relative

September 20-21, 2016

a bachelor's or more to construction and to manufacturing that.  Industry exposure itself may account for some a complete explanation. Americans and whites with a bachelor's degree or more, but I'm a little skeptical that the exposure of African Americans with could be significant enough to account for of this behavior.  I am skeptical that it provides the age structure of these racial and ethnic groups.  For investigation is something akin to what I've done that would and account for this sort of situation. a lot of work to be done not only here inside the Federal Reserve, but by There are marked differences in example, relatively speaking, the Hispanic population has far fewer elderly than the white population.  So another avenue for investigate the potential role of differential age structure But I think there's outside researchers as well.

View:  A Return to Conundrum,' was really interesting.  I want to reiterate something I think I've the years-how much I appreciate the alternative view boxes.  I know that supporting the particular views here, but I think they are really valuable, at least for forces us to think through things in a very MR. WILLIAMS.  I thought that the box in Tealbook A, 'Alternative the Greenspan said many times over you're not us-2,500 miles away we sit and discuss these, and it constructive way.  So, again, I view this as a very positive exercise.

the alternative scenario that was related Return to the Greenspan Conundrum.'  One intriguing scenario was that the unemployment rate comes down to 3Â¼ percent in know that throughout my lifetime we've never had a 3Â¼ percent unemployment However, that one exercise did get me looking at to that, which was, again, named 'A result of that alternative late 2019.

YELLEN.  No, I don't think so.  It got down to about 3.5, I think, in 1999? Yes. 3.9. MR. WILLIAMS.  Okay.  Now, I don't think we've had an unemployment rate that low. CHAIR MR. WILLIAMS.

It has not gone to 3.

MR. WILLIAMS.  It didn't go to 3Â¼ percent in the '60s.

MR. WILCOX.  No.

rate has not gone down to 3Â¼ percent in simulation was FRB/US model-if you thought through that scenario of a really strong economy, in to 3 percent?  Or do you think that something else Are we pushing this model outside of the historical norms far enough maybe labor force participation would pick up, maybe wages would pick up, or something? scenarios of an essentially linear model when you're taking it well a historical norm that was estimated? MR. WILLIAMS.  Okay.  So the unemployment my lifetime.  I'll stick with that.  [Laughter]  The question I have is-I think this done in the which monetary policy, for whatever reason, is not taming output growth, do you really think the unemployment rate would go down to close would give in the model? that How do you think about outside have a ready, fully formed answer for response, which is that I suspect that a feature of a lot of these the all-else-being-equal assumption would fail for sure.  Now, where the rivets was absolutely outlandish, I wouldn't have shown the results MR. WILCOX.  Really tough question.  I don't you.  I'll answer with a partial alternative scenarios in which we're stressing one aspect of the economy would entail other aspects.  So would pop off, I think, is what you're asking, and I don't know the answer to that.  If I had thought 3.2 percent unemployment

I do think it begins to push the boundaries of what we're likely design, this is a pretty extreme scenario.  I thought it was outcome a ready answer for how things might evolve differently from the way that the them.

The question I go to is, if we look at episodes in which unemployment economy hard, did we actually see something get off the linear relationships?  Do wages accelerate more quickly, ago, looking at how relationships work when at the ends of the distribution. MR. WILLIAMS. went very low or in which we were pushing the different happening?  Do we or does something else happen differently in those extreme scenarios?  I'm thinking about the stuff that I remember Mike Kiley doing years you're

MR. WILCOX.  As it happens, I think Mike is here.

MR. WILLIAMS.  He's going to deny my referencing his work.

MR. WILCOX.  Mike, do you have anything to add to this?

can add is that if you look at the it in front of me-that President Williams is referring to, you can confidence intervals of the unemployment rates are very low.  And the folks that FRB/US model are quite worried about exactly the point that President Williams is historical experience doesn't have these things.  What are the relevant But I just don't think we historical episodes.  The one that is in our lifetime, the one in the late 1990s, was MR. KILEY.  I think, David, the only thing that I picture-although I don't have see that the work on the raising, that nonlinearities?  Are they on participation?  Would they be in wages? have accompanied by very favorable other developments regarding productivity, et cetera.  So wage

MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you.

DUDLEY. One comment on a point that President Williams raised. today would be very different than a rate of 3.2 percent in the late '60s demographics of the population are quite different.  So while I basically take your you'd have to adjust for the changes in the demographic structure of the economy. VICE CHAIRMAN A rate of 3.2 percent because the point, I think that discrimination is a factor because we have a lot of evidence on things like longa role. I want to come back to the issue of the black and Hispanic unemployment.  I think there's no question term unemployment that hurts people in terms of their ability to be hired.  So while we don't know the proportion, I think discrimination definitely plays

that view is the matched rÃ©sumÃ© when identical rÃ©sumÃ©s are sent to employers but one of the names has two.  So my mind, is another piece of corroborating evidence. MR. WILCOX.  I'm inclined to agree, and this evidence pushes me further in that direction.  Another body of research that corroborates submitting, showing that a stereotypical ethnic association, and callback rates differ dramatically between the that, in

DUDLEY.  I just wanted to make it clear that it's not up in the air. evidence. VICE CHAIRMAN There's actually is evidence.  President Evans. CHAIR YELLEN.  Right.  There

I agree with President Williams that extrapolations like this do what could go wrong, and I think there are other things that could could be that the matching technology for employment so that, in fact, labor market outcomes are more efficient and you get lower MR. EVANS.  Well, make you wonder about happen, right?  In a simulation like this, it is better

If way, and that's why I mentioned the with a complete answer on all dimensions, I thought I'd come to the Committee with MR. WILCOX.

It's the of what the market expects, which is the OIS rate path.  And the surprise because the markets, as represented by the OIS rates, the federal funds rate than is embedded in the staff forecast. MR. KAMIN.  I would just say, because the entire outlook for the U.S. and global economy is about the comparison of that and one measure it's that gap that represents expect a much shallower uplift in kind of assumption, because Taylor (1999) is getting further and further away from market MR. BULLARD.  Would you say that this is becoming increasingly tenuous, to make this expectations?

that we that staff assumption about the path of the federal funds rate is so that our dollar forecast is forecast and the conditioning assumption about raises the question about what is the right conditioning assumption funds rate, and we have reviewed that, and I'll let one of my colleagues more on that.

Now, in the Tealbook we have an alternative assumption of a 10 percent rise over that is, dwarfs the it's particularly stark when exchange rates because you would expect foreign exchange markets to already have bank policies, and therefore you wouldn't be MR. BULLARD.  Well, the reason I bring this up is because you look at encompassed assumptions about various central able to predict very well-and, in fact, you can't predict very well-what's going to happen to

question, only looking at the Tealbook.  The Tealbook unemployment rate for 2019 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My question is spawned by President Williams's of 4.2 percent, and long-run of 5-would there be historical experience to say what happens when you go from 4.2 to 5, just even in that range?

and then back up to the natural rate are pretty rare, and as I think Michael Kiley was that point, with a rising unemployment rate, some and we might end up with something other than a smooth MR. WILCOX.  There's not a lot.  The excursions of the unemployment rate below the natural rate referring to, one has to wonder whether at nonlinear dynamics might take over landing.

September 20-21, 2016

the postwar period, in my view, is less dispositive on that point than first appear because many of the recessions in the postwar period were actually in order to wring inflation out of the system.  This to the designation by Christina Romer and David Romer of the so-called mind of the Committee had switched from one mode, growth, to another mode, which was fighting inflation.  So I less evident than it might seem on the surface that it's impossible to accomplish a there isn't a long I think the record of it might deliberatively induced by the Federal Reserve is what gave rise 'Romer dates' when they divined that the which was promoting economic think it's smooth landing of the kind that's portrayed at the baseline projection, but historical record to show that it can be done.

It's good enough.  And quality of their work is, simply, 'How well did you marshal the it well by appealing to history, foreign central If I may, just ever so briefly, I'd like to come back to President Williams's comment about the alternative Committee since that franchise was introduced, context.  It's the only place in the Tealbook in which I give individual staff members a byline, so they're individually invested and identified in the production of that.  The goal here is to ask staff members to I'm asking them is that I will never ask them if they believe that their scenario scenario, because if I did that, I would be putting them their judgment is better than mine.

something, again, for people who may not be it's impossible to get a soft landing when you have the unemployment rate way its natural rate.  You didn't actually say what the fact was, and the fact is, it's never the thing that you were talking about think that does get to President George's question.  We have rate went up more than that wasn't associated with a recession.  Now, the reasons for that, which you about why that is the case, is definitely a live subject.  But it is a fact but a fact that this hasn't occurred in the past.  So it is an that low, it is very hard, and think-to find an example of that being I don't know if that was a legal two-hander [laughter]. MR. WILLIAMS.  Yes.  I want to clarify following exactly what David said earlier.  You said something about how you may have assumed that below happened.  So I just wanted everyone to be clear.  That's that you weren't convinced by, but I not seen an example in the postwar history in which the unemployment Â½ percentage point brought up in the debate striking-not even a 'stylized' area in which I worry that, when you have an unemployment rate historically hard-you have to go way back in history, I successful.

This is an important issue.  I'm going to guess that in models you've President Williams-I don't tabulate these things myself-if you simulate them, a lot of examples in which the unemployment rate has gone up in those without it being what somebody might call a recession.  Andin view of the small recessions that we've had and some lack of luck during some of these-as we were that, well, 1990 and came about.  And, you MR. EVANS. written down, you probably have simulations number of talking about in Chicago just last week, one of my colleagues pointed out '91 could have been a soft landing, but then Iraq's invasion of Kuwait

September 20-21, 2016

number of observations.  There are that.  If it was as much of a slam dunk as your comment kind of suggests just don't think they are.  So it's because, frankly, I think it is a big deal.  If, in fact, undershooting the is something that is going to lead to a recession, and if we think the Phillips curve mechanism is going to be important to get inflation up to our target, well, probably never going to get it up to target, because we're going to say, 'If I do this, recession, and that would be worse.'  And then that's going to ratify that 2 percent as this is a really important issue for more discussion. know, things happen during fragile times.  So there's a small some shocks that do offhand, then your models ought to be reflecting this, and I worth a lot of discussion natural rate of unemployment that then, we're I'll have a a ceiling.  So I think

YELLEN.  I absolutely agree with you. CHAIR

I agree, President Evans-and President Williams, too.  I think that one area in which it is going to be difficult to make solid I certainly feel that I can't speak with great conviction that our nice, tidy that take over in a more fragile economy when demand more slowly.  One is struck, for example, by the profile of unemployment over the increases in the unemployment rate, and you don't see rate.  And in a simple, tidy linear model like the discrepancy in behavior. MR. WILCOX. needs to acknowledge that this is an progress in research. linear models describe well the dynamics is growing business cycle.  You see steep equivalently steep declines in the unemployment FRB/US model, there probably shouldn't be that that there have been two attempts at a soft landing in the II era.  And, as President Evans just mentioned, I think there is an easily event with regard to one of them-namely, the 1990 invasion of Kuwait by IraqI just Now, that said, my impression is post-World War identifiable that provided a plausible shock of sharp magnitude that disrupted economic processes. don't think you can look to the historical record and get a dispositive answer on that question.

have a huge amount of confidence in the ability of our models to discriminate, the kind of model you go to in looking for that answer-that will pretty much give you If you go to a linear model like the FRB/US model and you rely on that model as the feasible that there's no particular problem here. that incorporates nonlinear dynamics, that will be the answer that you get.

This pickup will largely reflect continued strength in consumption and some rebuilding of inventories.  Growth in real final sales been fairly solid over the past year, and I expect abstracting from transitory fluctuations induced by inventory changes, domestic growth remains quite healthy, with growth of our trading partners.

core PCE inflation for the second half of this year is slightly than the Tealbook's.  By the end of 2017, I expect core inflation to be only slightly below in the Michigan survey.  However, as with other measures of inflation quartile has been relatively stable, with most of the decline coming from My expectation regarding higher our 2 percent inflation target.

This forecast of an overshoot of full employment is not an also expect the implies a Â½ percentage point overshoot of full employment.  My estimate of the only a 0.2 percentage point overshoot of full the unemployment rate to be in the long Even with a 4.5 percent outlier, as both the Tealbook and the Blue Chip consensus forecast unemployment rate to be 4Â½ percent by the end of 2017.  Using the Tealbook's estimate of the natural rate, this natural rate is a bit lower, so 4Â½ percent implies employment.  Thus, within 15 months, all three forecasts expect the unemployment rate to fall below where the consensus of the Committee expects run.

the end of 2019.  Hence, my forecast envisions economic growth in tightening in 2017.  The Tealbook also expects to fall to 4.2 percent.  While this is my modal forecast, I believe risks are we will exceed this already large employment.  If foreign trade partners grow more quickly or moderate demand labor force, the unemployment rate could easily decline Like the Tealbook, I expect the unemployment rate to continue drifting down through 2018, reaching 4.2 percent at excess of potential, even with 100 basis points of the unemployment rate balanced around that outlook.  There is a significant risk that overshoot of full does not draw workers back into the even further.

why I see balanced risks associated with the Tealbook forecast of the an additional increase in labor force staff examined state-level participation rates to see if unemployment rate is quite low.  They do not One reason unemployment rate is because I believe an assumption of participation is far from certain.  My participation has risen significantly in states whose

rate full employment, we will be attempting a feat Historically, every attempt to raise the unemployment rate resulted in a recession that much larger rise in unemployment than a few tenths.  Overshooting tends to happen was part of the discussion that we were just having, as mentioned earlier Evans.  I think this is actually very fundamental to the be possible to have a soft landing, is it we do a significant overshoot? If we find ourselves in the position in which we need to increase the unemployment Â½ percentage point or more in order to return to that is yet to be accomplished. Â½ percentage point or more from below full employment has produces a in both directions.  This by President Williams and President discussions that we are having today.  While it may probable, particularly if there are advantages to using accommodative monetary policy to probe for stronger market, we must balance these potential benefits against the a significant overshoot of full employment that could ultimately do even more harm to the slowdown, the ensuing will likely fall disproportionately on low-skilled workers and minorities.  I will discuss of that concern tomorrow.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

The unemployment rate had declined 0.6 percentage point to 5 percent, close to low In assessing December. since jobs per most estimates of the natural rate.  Real GDP had grown at about 2 percent, supported by strong PCE growth.  And 12-month core PCE inflation had stabilized at 1.3 percent despite headline inflation and a strengthening dollar.

In contrast, as Elizabeth Klee's presentation, December.  Then, the so we probably would have been making our third increase of the year at the funds rate target above 1 percent.

rise to a question:  What explains the significant shift in our policy stance over little or no change in the outlook for employment or inflation?  Well, I is employment and a lower steady-state real interest rate and arguably would imply a lower value for the latest productivity numbers?  This is analogous to how much we the trend employment growth is 30,000 after seeing the May methods of answer is, essentially, some, but not enough to rationalize where the funds rate is today. This gives that time frame despite mentioned that productivity growth has been lower than expected.  Monetary policy is unlikely to have much effect on productivity, though, and besides, our mandate inflation, not productivity or output.  But, of course, lower steady-state productivity growth does imply intercept term in a Taylor-type policy reaction rule.  So, by how much should we revise our estimate of r * in response to the should think trend employment has fallen after seeing the May employment report.  Obviously, you wouldn't think that employment report; one uses a moving average of recent data.

The recent data on equipment investment continue to tepid, manufacturing output remains flat, and real exports are a little more than 1 percent the four quarters year, looks to be contracting in the middle of this year.

However, other parts of the economy appreciation of the dollar since be quite below their level a year ago.  Corporate profits fell close to 5 percent over ending in the second quarter, and the housing sector, which provided important support to GDP growth last economic growth to move up from its weak pace weakness in inflation has been mixed.  While core inflation has increased from a year from our target, which is symmetric, and some measures of expectations remain quite low.  The recent data seem consistent with the staff's this year.  But Progress on ago, we're still some distance inflation projection that core PCE inflation would slow noticeably over the second half of on a 12-month basis, core PCE inflation is estimated to be 1.6 percent in August, which is an improvement over a year ago.

If the staff projection for September is months out of the past eight years.  I want to highlight this fact because it does seem the stabilization of the dollar and oil prices, there is tightening, there are ample reasons to worry that the forces alone will not be sufficient to move core back to our target.  First, survey-based expectations and very weak readings on inflation compensation may indicate that Despite the recent increases in oil and stabilization of the dollar, 10-year inflation compensation is less than 1.5 percent, its historic low.  At the same time, as everyone, I think, has noted, median 5-to-10-year expectations in the Michigan survey matched its historical low of 2.5 percent in both resource utilization and inflation and signs of downward pressure on inflation requires ensuring the U.S. economy maintains Nonetheless, core inflation has not yet convincingly broken out of the 1.4 to 1.6 percent range it has relative correct, core PCE inflation on a 12-month change basis will have been below 2 percent for all but four important for our discussion of policy.  With reason to expect inflation to rise.  However, even putting aside the renewed dollar appreciation that would likely accompany further unwinding of these recent research suggests the Phillips curve is quite flat.  Second, as I noted earlier, we may still be some distance from full employment.  And, lastly, the persistently low level of inflation inflation expectations have moved down in recent quarters. prices close to inflation August and the preliminary September reading. In view of the apparent weak relationship between levels of expectations, reaching our inflation target sufficient positive momentum, especiallyin the broader international environment.

hires in August was not appropriate.  One hears concern that the U-3 unemployment rate has barely fallen over the course of the past over the same period, the participation rate has stopped falling.  I believe we the we May, when the U-3 unemployment rate declined to 4.7 percent while the participation in participation may reflect the effects of the modest pickup rate of increase of the employment cost index about 2 percent last year to around 2.5 percent this year. that the trend rate of new hires is declining, but that as the labor market tightens. First, the labor market.  Employment has been continuing to grow at a good pace, averaging 180,000 per month so far this year.  Calculations suggest that depending on the rate of labor force participation, it will take somewhere between 75,000 and 150,000 net new hires a month to keep the U-3 unemployment rate from rising.  Accordingly, the gloomy tone of the headlines about the 151,000 estimate of net new the 12 months, but should prefer the current labor market situation, in which people are being attracted back into labor force while the unemployment rate remains constant, to a situation such as the one faced in rate declined significantly.  The rise in wage growth we are now seeing, with the having risen from an annual rate of Attention has also been drawn to the fact should not be a surprise

September 20-21, 2016

the past year, we have been concerned about the effects of a variety of devaluation, market turbulence in first six months of this year, the May pothole, Brexit, and more.  But employment has each temporary slowdown.  This has been, and continues to be, a least in terms of employment. Over the course of negative shocks on the U.S. economy, including the Chinese the resumed robust growth after powerful recovery, at me turn now to the second part, inflation.  We have not heard many complaints about of inflation from the general public.  The 2 percent inflation target was set originally of positive inflation and the increased efficiency of the labor market that a moderate rate of inflation makes possible.  I do not recall the costs associated with a greater probability of being at the zero lower bound or the were taken into account at that time, which I rate of PCE inflation has been increasing since the the optimal rate of inflation, we should be happy to be as close as the target we have chosen, particularly when the Phillips curve appears to be so flat. that the Phillips curve lives, if not with the same vigor as in the past. Let the low rate as a tradeoff between the many costs reallocation in that effective lower bound with a lower rate of inflation think was the early and mid-'90s.  The core middle of last year-slowly, to be sure-and is now close to our 2 percent target. In view of the imprecision of our estimates of we are to The CPI rate of core inflation has been above 2 percent and the rate of wage increase has been increasing, an indication But, on balance, I believe we are close to meeting our inflation target.

One is the argument that we set 2 percent as our target, that is the number we have to hit if we are to remain weight, though I do not believe we need to hit precisely that some divergence should be permitted both above and below 2 percent. the confidence interval around the economic cost of diverging from the Let me discuss a few other aspects of the inflation target. because credible.  I give this argument some 2 percent, but rather Taking into account

Well, the optimal rate of inflation is an area of active research and debate.  But, actually, is a serious matter not to be entered into lightly.  First, there are welfare which kick in at a relatively low rate of inflation, especially in the form rate, credibility-reducing part of history.  If such a mechanism for dealing the target rate-for instance, the mechanism used by Canada in which the target can, in principle, be reset every five years. A final point on inflation.  The jury is still out on whether there has been a downward revision in the level of  *, something that's r because the future is long and 'permanent' r * is large, which is more relevant.  However, as everyone knows, if  * remains low for a r monetary policy could be constrained by the ELB more frequently than in the past.  Should we, therefore, of course, changing the target rate costs to higher inflation, of indexation.  Further, there is the credibility cost of changing the target inflation something that done once becomes a permanent step were nonetheless taken, it would be essential to include a formal with future changes in inflation

core PCE inflation is indeed approaching its target real wages are rising at a more rapid rate than earlier in the post-Great Recession deciding to change the monetary framework to solved within a year or two without changing the inflation So, on inflation, all this is to say that level, that period, and that we need to think very hard before solve a problem that is likely to be target.

On this point, I growth a very useful reminder that monthly employment gains are much lower than what we've been used to in the meeting, looking across a lot of estimates, including those the Chicago Federal Reserve, my own view is that something like the likely benchmark as we go forward.  Of course, we've been averaging about an extraordinary pace that can't be sustained Perhaps the most crucial issue regarding the forecast is not so numbers found the box in Tealbook A about the neutral pace of payroll steady-state past.

My own staff has more granular demographic adjustment.  They went to the underlying microdata of fundamental labor force transitions on the movements between 'employment,' and 'out of the labor force,' and they used a common factor model to try to demographic factors that affect these transitions and then compute a new, arguably rate.  The analysis based the past decade or so, changes in the demographic composition labor force have lowered the natural rate, as President Evans and others have said, but by consistent with a view that the 4.75 and 5 percent, but I don't think demographics can push natural rate of unemployment.

For firms issuing high-yield debt, debt also at its highest level since 2003.

At the December 2015 meeting at which the the interest rate, I wrote down three rate increases for 2016, and I guess I see since then that have changed my view of the appropriate large devaluation of the RMB was followed by a series of weak incoming GDP growth in the first half of the year came in at 1Â¼ percent, well below sharply in the first half.  Although this weakness is leave, for me, a declining residue of uncertainty.  Second, and of more rates have declined significantly right across the curve, many others, I have come to the view that rates need to be lower than I had thought to increasingly unrealistic in the global context that we are now in.  For me, that argues for a in the direction of travel. MR. Committee raised two main unexpected developments path so far this year.  First, the period of financial market turmoil in January and February linked to the possibility of a data.  Real expectations.  Payroll growth also declined now passing, it does significance for the period ahead, interest and, like support activity.  The kinds of rate increases that have been in the SEP for the past few years seem more gradual path of increases but not a change even though GDP in the first half disappointed, past year, as David Wilcox covered, was about a decline in indicator.  They have behaved over the past four quarters. To talk about each of those a little bit, about half of that slowdown over the inventory accumulation-an inventory correction-which really says little about the underlying strength of demand.  Private domestic final purchases are a better about as expected, growing at 3 percent last quarter and 2Â¼ percent

The Tealbook and seemingly all private forecasters expect stronger GDP growth in the second half.  And, for what I regard as good reasons:  The inventory correction should end.  The

September 20-21, 2016

from lower oil prices that should end now that rig counts appear to effects of the big increase in the exchange value of the dollar conditions have eased materially since December.  And, finally, spending should remain strong, with rising real incomes, continued job market sheets.  Overall, I expect strong growth in the 2016 GDP close to 2 percent for the year as a whole. drag on business investment have stabilized.  The contractionary should be waning.  Financial consumer strength, and much improved household balance second half that will lift markets, payroll growth this year has averaged 180,000, down 50,000 from last time of the June meeting, was only about 120,000, months real-time indicator of the strength of GDP than is reported GDP.  With the increase and participation appear now to be very close to economy is pretty close to full employment.  Indeed, wages, the very low levels of productivity growth and past few years mean that unit labor costs are now rising faster than prices.  In Board's survey on job availability now shows, for the first time since more respondents think jobs are plentiful than find them hard to get, and that has at or below the natural rate. In labor year's pace, but the underlying pattern is significant.  The average for March, April, and May, which is what the Committee saw at the which was a sharp deceleration since 2015.  Fortunately, the average for the past three through August is back up to 230,000, which is reassuring.  I would add that labor markets are also a better in labor force participation, both unemployment their longer-term trends, suggesting that the despite modest rates of increases for inflation over the addition, the Conference 2008, that generally only happened when unemployment is

to recent years, the improvement in labor markets has shown up this year in Tealbook, and holding the unemployment rate would now be 4.3 percent.  I suspect that this would have In contrast the form of an apparent upside surprise in our admittedly volatile measure of labor force participation.  If participation had declined as predicted in the December all else equal,

September 20-21, 2016

different meeting if that had been the case.  In any case, above-forecast labor force that the economy has more room to expand, or at least that supply-side are probably more than usually uncertain, and I think we would be wise to take that into job growth continues at anything like these rates, fall well below current estimates of the natural rate, or labor force trend, or both.  Any of these outcomes would return to 2 percent inflation and would be welcome for me.  Another possibility is that the natural rate. also possible, of course, that wage and price pressures will appear to an unexpected a more aggressive response from policy and potentially put the risk.  There are no risk-free paths, and this latter I find a good argument for which the been a very participation suggests limits account in thinking about policy.  If unemployment may participation may continue to improve relative to support a inflation does not pick up and that we continue to revise down our estimate of Finally, it's degree, and that would require recovery at time has not yet come, in my thinking.

Between that SEP and FOMC participant expectations regarding the total number rate increases for this year and next year decline from eight to three.

On to Having tried to reconstitute them Sunday evening and yesterday, had been fleeting, and for that reason, I'm grateful that Presidents Evans, what I actually think is the most important thing to talk about in this way, I'm going to try to make some remarks about that. MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  During the day on Saturday and on Sunday morning, I composed a set of remarks for the economic go-round that be remembered as one of the Sunday afternoon, my computer crashed, and those remarks, unfortunately, were lost posterity.  [Laughter] somehow the brilliance Rosengren, and Williams meeting:  the relative risks of overshoot against failing to stimulate more.

And even though I come out differently from, say, where is, I think he has raised an important set of issues both here and in his to see what the for the period ahead. the like.  Whatever one's view, and I think people know where I stand on this relative to others on the Committee, we are surely in a sides have President Rosengren public speeches, which it behooves all of us to engage in and just try to balance right path is risk of overshooting-and as I think the and Williams and David Wilcox showed, it's that, as President Williams pointed out, it's hard to find an example landing where unemployment went up several tenths of a percentage point recession.  But, on the other side, it is also hard to find one of those circumstances in FOMC did not arguably keep its foot on the brake way too long.  One has to recognize well above target for some period of time.  So I at history and try to learn from it, I suspect that going to provide an answer here, even though it will, in a sort of Biblical fashion, little bit of support on both sides. The first thing I'd say on that-and this is the discussion among Presidents Evans, Rosengren, actually hard to find historical examples of pretty much anything that we want to demonstrate here.  One of the problems is when there was a soft without a which the that, in these cases, inflation had actually gotten think while it's reasonable for all of us to look history isn't provide a

the risks associated with a modest to moderate overshoot are, I the ones that Eric lays out, and others have echoed, and are the ones that we should be questions are, first:  How likely is that to happen?  Because, obviously, What are the risks on the other side?  That is, if one takes in order to avoid those risks, what kinds of risks are you So, the question of what think, are worried about.  And the that's important.  And then, second: the approach of beginning to raise rates courting on the other side?

September 20-21, 2016

said about history, while I agree that there is the risk to respond in a very robust way and thereby induces a recession, to me that in an environment in which inflation has been running below target as long as that the risks are nontrivial but modest to moderate. reinforced for me by looking at the flip side of this, which is:  What are the risks of rate going down below As you can tell from what I already of an overshoot that requires us it seems it has, in which there is a global arguably disinflationary-and certainly not inflationaryenvironment, and in which we are talking not about massive overshoots but a few tenths of a percentage point overshoot, my instinct is And that's nonlinearity in the labor market-specifically, with the unemployment what is perceived to be a natural rate?

the concern, I think there aren't really a lot of historical examples to support that a nonlinear relationship between falling unemployment, inflation, presumably, at least in part because of the fact that curve had already flattened by then.  So if you want to see price inflation being think you have to go back to lived through that period, but I do inflation directly at that time-my understanding is that the the natural rate may have been off by a substantial amount, like 1 or maybe was really quite a the one in which we find ourselves today. If this is kind of concern.  If you want to see arguably below the natural rate, and a nonlinear increase in wages, you can go back to the 1990s, but that did not translate into price the Phillips associated in a nonlinear fashion with a dip below the natural rate, I the 1960s.  And if you're going back to the 1960s-again, I not recall what was happening with estimates of 2 percentage points, not several tenths of a percentage point.  So, again, it different context from add to that the uncertainty that Governor Brainard and President Evans have regarding the exact value of the natural rate of unemployment is.  If we're worrying if it's actually lower than the staff estimate of 5 percent, And then, I referred to about overshooting it by too much and

September 20-21, 2016

we are talking about are obviously smaller still.  And I do to think there's a pretty good chance that the rate of unemployment at which even wage there really is in the labor market than some believed.  That is the significance of the fact that the rate has remained stable during this period.  It is that we've been creating jobs at with new entrants into the labor force-and yet not been falling during that period. then the kinds of overshooting that continue pressures will be significantly built up is lower than the 5 percent estimated by the staff.  What we have seen over the past year or so has been an encouraging phenomenon that more slack unemployment a healthy clip-above the number needed to deal unemployment has and unemployment beginning to decline very quickly.  But to me as though it is more likely that we are testing the bounds of how much slack there will be something more of a gradual process, because the amounts really have many people expected even a year or two ago. Now, maybe that could all reverse very quickly, and you would simultaneously have no people coming into the labor market it seems is, and this exceeded, I think, what

relevant comments on this from current activities:  EPOP has been this year than last year, again suggesting that it has been drawing slack back to be present, we acceleration of wages at the high end of the distribution of wage growth, is the phenomenon that has been observed during past recoveries when unemployment Just a couple of mildly increasing faster into the labor market.  And recently, compensation increases have actually flattened out a bit. With some exceptions, like construction, for which supply constraints do seem haven't seen an unusual and that dropped below what later proved to be the natural rate.

me, the situation we're in now is a pretty good one of continued job creation is taking up slack in the economy, a process that has helped bring the share of the long-term All in all, to that unemployed back to its pre-crisis level.  It is now helping minority and other groups whose

September 20-21, 2016

run significantly higher than the average for the labor force as a unemployment rates traditionally whole.

my own assessment, gloss, and obviously, to some degree, disagreement with as to how much of a risk there is there.  And I'd just much on the other side, there are risks, too.  There is, it seems to me, a secular-stagnation hypothesis.  Maybe not secular cognitive transmogrification of headwinds into prevailing winds, which of people have gone through, is something that needs to be taken quite seriously. suggests, again, that if we're in an environment in which there is a risk that inflation is not on what I've characterized as the 'show me' side of things, of looking for tangible that inflation is rising toward and will remain around its target level. So that's the very salient issue that Eric raised more briefly point out that, growing case for some variant on the stagnation itself, but the I think a lot That going to go up and indeed is susceptible to recessions pushing it down further again, one actually wants to err evidence issues, which Presidents Evans, Rosengren, to continue now, right one to have maybe in October as people think, looking ahead, about and forcing each of us to confront the quite legitimate instincts are taking.  Thank you, Madam Chair. I don't expect to persuade people who have the other view, but I really do think that that's the discussion.  The discussion of the set of and Williams started in their questioning of David Wilcox and which I'm trying is I think probably the where this balance of risks really does lie position that those who have the opposite

DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I want to endorse what is really the germane wrestling with.  And I think that one reason why I'm less worried about the are growing only very modestly VICE CHAIRMAN Governor Tarullo just said.  I think this issue about where the risk lies subject that we're overshooting risk, which I think is legitimate, is because we

the a whole the unemployment rate allowed to also was a fundamental error in policymakers' bit higher, the case that the change in the inflation rate would continue to go up every full-employment rate.  So I think there was a as inflation expectations worse year after year.  I think coming back in October and maybe actually historical evidence is certainly an interesting thing to take a look at.  I earlier Obviously, nobody wants to repeat the 1960s.  But I would emphasize that, to get inflation that we got in the 1970s, we had to work really, really hard for a decade of series of policy mistakes over and over again.  Not only was decline below the natural rate, but I think there thinking that if the unemployment rate got too low, the inflation rate would go a little but it wouldn't be year that you kept the unemployment rate below its model failure in terms of how the inflation process actually worked, so got unanchored, what happened was, as you stayed below that full employment unemployment rate, inflation got reviewing some of this would encourage the staff to bring all this back to us and maybe actually talk about some of these various episodes and whether the current situation is different or similar to those circumstances.

said many times, have not changed much the year, and for 2017 and 2018 we're penciling in growth around 2 percent but have considerable uncertainty about that.  With respect to the quarters-I'm of two minds.  On the Now, in terms of the outlook, my views, as I've since the previous FOMC meeting.  On the growth side, we expect real GDP growth to average about 2Â¾ percent during the second half of GDP very near-term outlook-in other words, the next couple of one hand, I do take comfort from the fact that financial conditions are accommodative, the fiscal

September 20-21, 2016

real GDP is getting a short-term boost as the drag due to the decline in itself.  But, on the other hand, we do have to recognize that some report had from that, the rest of the report was very we saw in average impulse is positive, and inventory investment reverses of the recent data have been quite weak.  For example, although the last employment 151,000 in payrolls and people took a lot of comfort soft-aggregate hours worked declined, and some of the earlier rise that hourly earnings on a year-over-year basis reversed.

were quite soft in August, suggesting that maybe some of the in consumer spending has faded, and the past two ISM reports for want to look at a smooth three-month moving average. of the declines in both of those were quite large, so I'm not willing to discount it In addition, retail sales recent momentum manufacturing and services for August registered large drops.  As President Kaplan has noted, this may just be noise, and maybe we But the size completely.

to the labor market, my assessment is that there is still some slack.  I think about the monthly payroll gains needed to keep the long run, which is suggested at 85,000 to 115,000 in the to use in assessing when is to remove monetary policy accommodation.  As we've seen over the past months, payrolls can grow considerably more rapidly than that without necessarily pushing I can, in fact, imagine payroll gains persisting at 151,000 a month or more for some time that generating much downward movement in the unemployment rate.  If that occurred With respect we need to be clear when we talk unemployment rate steady in the Tealbook.  That is a long-run concept and may not be a good metric the appropriate time eight down the unemployment rate.  If an improving labor market pulls discouraged workers back into the labor force, I think that's a welcome development, and we don't necessarily want to forestall that. without and other data suggested no evidence of a rise in inflationary pressures, the right conclusion

September 20-21, 2016

just depend on what is happening in the labor market.  It would depend on here, though, is that we shouldn't suggest that our actions are going to monthly payroll change relative to the long-term pace a metric, I think, in terms might be to conceivably keep monetary policy on hold for some time to come.  Obviously, the decision wouldn't many factors.  My point mainly be dictated by the pace of consistent with a stable unemployment rate.  That is just too simplistic of our monetary policy decision rule.

concerned about on the economic growth side is whether low interest are losing their punch in terms of supporting the economy.  There are at least two issues time, as the activity that has been by lower interest rates-for example, motor vehicle sales-is no longer there to see that in the motor vehicle sector, as and in August actually declined.  The second is the prospect rate.  If rates stay very low, households, pension funds, and endowments will likely have to save achieve their wealth objectives.  On the household side, we see some evidence of this in the household saving rate is a bit elevated today relative to what one would expect, basis of the level of household net worth relative to income.  Now, one could take this was restored, the household savings rate would could be rate as interest rates.  As I've said at other meetings, we is going to react to this long period of low interest rates is just an open Another issue I am rates here.  First, the attenuation of monetary policy stimulus over pulled forward when the future inevitably arises.  We may be starting sales have flattened out this year that a persistent period of low interest rates may eventually lead to a rise in the saving real more to the fact that just on the as a positive sign.  If the typical relationship drop, and consumption would grow faster than income as the saving rate declined.

If the saving rate were to rise, consumption would grow more slowly than activity. question at income, and that, in turn, would exert a restraining effect on economic respect to institutions such as pensions and endowments, I'd like to relate a for overseeing the management of a major endowment fund recently.  Currently, this university takes 5 percent of its each year into its general budget.  But 5 percent seems too high to be sustainable in financial market environment, so the endowment managers are faced with some They can take more risks to generate a 5 percent real rate of return, they can the draw on the endowment to a smaller percentage and reduce university spending to let the endowment diminish in size in real terms by maintaining the it. all going to play out in terms of timing, but this does seem to be another translate into less spending.  The same dynamic is at play in terms defined-benefit plans and state and local pension plans.  For both corporate and state they are assuming varies considerably a pretty broad range.  But the median is around 7Â½ percent long term. declining longer-term rates have have supported the terms.

So sluggish economic growth.  In fact, you could argue that's what we've been experiencing.

the year, now it expectation is being realized.  Combined with somewhat less wage pressure in the recent reading, the persistence of low energy prices, and subdued inflation expectations, much risk that inflation is going to get away from us on the upside any is still low and below our target, the likelihood that there is still market, and some concerns I have about the growth outlook all reinforce little urgency to tightening monetary policy right now.  I think a patient for the time being, but more on that tomorrow. On the inflation side, my outlook also hasn't changed much.  Whereas before we had an expectation that core PCE inflation would moderate during the second half of appears that most there doesn't seem to be time soon.  The fact that inflation some slack in the labor my view that there is approach is warranted on the updraft in the short-term LIBOR and in the foreign much of the discussion at over the weekend.  The general consensus was Money market fund reforms that require prime institutional money market factor.  Much Finally, a few thoughts exchange swap basis for both the euro and yen.

This suggests to me that money market fund reform may average maturities.  The consequence of that will push up yields on these funds compared with Treasury funds, and that will actually cause to flow back into the prime funds. money has already shifted out of such money market market mutual fund's prime institutional funds, average most, if not all, of the adjustment in short-term rates due to already have taken place.

The main monetary policy, in my mind, is how changes in the expected short-term rate path If the three-month LIBOR rises because the term structure of rates otherwise doesn't change, then I think the effect should be little.  So if everything is and the only thing that has moved is three-month LIBOR, I don't really think that has much weight think there are several good reasons not to tighten monetary policy rise in the three-month LIBOR or money market fund reform The Tealbook looks at represents corporate borrowing costs.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  And my thanks to everyone for an interesting discussion risks that we face at this juncture.  I'd just like to wrap up the that I consider relevant to our policy discussion CHAIR of the outlook and particularly the go-round with brief comments on two issues

September 20-21, 2016

for resource And, second, are there signs of emerging inflation pressures? tomorrow.  First, what does the current pace of labor market improvement imply utilization?

issue, I'm echoing what the Vice Chairman and Governor Tarullo and others market conditions have improved appreciably economy has added about 2Â½ million jobs, employment-to-population ratio to rise 0.3 percentage point despite demographic that are pulling down the underlying trend.  Furthermore, job growth remained solid gains averaging about 180,000 per month over of the apparent pickup in real GDP growth in the second half of expect, as the Tealbook does, that job gains will remain solid rest of the year and into early next year.  Even if payroll gains in coming months running ahead of what is sustainable in On the first have indicated:  The data clearly show that labor over the past year.  Since August of last year, the enabling the effects through the late spring and summer, with payroll the past four months. In light this year, it seems reasonable to through the were to moderate somewhat from their recent average pace-say, to the 150,000 increase recorded in August-employment growth would still be the longer run.  A number of you have emphasized this point.

to stabilize the unemployment rate, most likely to in the 85,000 to 115,000 per month range,in view of the downward trend in labor gains, but would be problematic in year suggest that the economy may The staff's estimates, reported in the Tealbook,  suggest that job gains will eventually have to moderate substantially over time somewhere force participation and likely divergence between payroll and household employment conceivably as low as 65,000 per month.  That long-run growth constraint does not necessarily imply, though, that continued job gains in the 150,000 to 200,000 range the near term, because data we have received over the past have more room to grow than previously thought.

One reasonable response to this unexpected employment estimated to be consistent with a using the standard sort of revision effectively constitutes a favorable supply shock, and it that the economy can sustainability operate with a higher long-run employment-toConsider the labor force declining as virtually unchanged, despite development would be to revise up the path of given unemployment rate.  For anyone who gauges inflationary pressures unemployment gap, this implies population ratio.

that labor market modest pace recently.  Involuntary part-time employment and changed since last fall.  And even in the those indicators that continue to trend up-such as JOLTS readings on openings and job availability and whether jobs are hard to fill-the pace of have slowed this year. Other labor indicators also seem to be consistent with the proposition slack has been shrinking at only a the broad U-6 measure of labor utilization are both little case of quits and survey assessments of improvement appears to

I anticipate that utilization will continue to tighten at a if we want to ensure longer-run price stability.  Nonetheless, we labor market would help speed the return to 2 percent inflation. the unemployment rate is still a couple of tenths above my estimate of its longer-run 1 percentage point above its average In light of these developments, gradual pace as we move into next year, especially as I see some potential for a healthy labor market to attract yet more people back into the labor force.  Of course, employment growth does have to moderate at some point should be wary of slowing employment growth too rapidly, especially as some slack still remains, and a moderately tight After all, value, and involuntary part-time employment is more than pre-crisis level.

September 20-21, 2016

turn to my second question:  Are there signs of emerging inflation pressures? more concerned that we could be falling 'behind the curve,' but, many signs of that yet.  The September Beige Book reported remarkably few rising cost pressures or planned price increases.  From what I heard around the table, this Let me now If there were, I would be frankly, I can't see signs of was also not a significant theme in your conversations with your various business contacts.

Oil prices the dollar are little changed from where they stood last fall. have moved up some this year, but only to a moderate level. of inflation compensation and survey-based measures of longer-run expectations have changed little in recent months and remain at or below their longerI and the staff to expect that core PCE inflation will come in at just over waning effects of past year ago.   And my  forecast for 2015 has As regards hard data, nominal wage and the foreign exchange value of Non-energy commodity prices Market-based measures inflation run averages.  Most directly, the monthly price data have come in about as expected.  Accordingly, I continue 1Â½ percent this year.  That's up Â¼ percentage point from 2015 due to the dollar appreciation.  That was my SEP forecast a remained essentially unchanged since then.

Of course, if one looked at welfare than movements underlying inflation would be cause for concern.  But the Committee was true when it decided to define our inflation objective using the PCE measure.  Alternatively,

Finally, it is worth stressing that some other price measures, trimmed mean PCE price index, also in underlying inflation over the past two or three years.  Let me stop one might be alarmed by the growing wedge between these signals We conducted some regression opposite.  When core CPI inflation rises relative to core PCE inflation, it's core CPI inflation that tends including GDP prices excluding food and energy and the suggest little net change there.  I think we still have time before we head to dinner to let Thomas give us his policy briefing.

to the handout MR. LAUBACH. 7   Thank you, Madam Chair.  I will be referring labeled 'Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.'

the amount of monetary federal funds issue through the lens of your SEP-implied neutral real One issue you have been discussing in recent meetings is policy accommodation provided by current and expected settings for the rate.  Exhibit 1 examines that rates.

SEP, your forecasts for 2017 and 2018 for changed very little over the past year, with the longer-run level and the appropriate path of the federal funds rate shifted down notably.  That shift reflects to both the longer-run equilibrium level of the federal funds rate and the to rise to achieve the Committee's the the funds rate over run, most of you expected that it would be appropriate to move the policy a pace that would put it close to its longer-run level by the end of 2018.  In moved lower.  And many of you now anticipate that end of 2019, still be below its longer-run level. As Beth noted in her briefing on the your two key goal variables have unemployment rate at the end of 2018 at or slightly below its inflation moving toward the Committee's objective.  However, as shown in the topleft panel, your assessments of associated with those projections has revisions pace at which the federal funds rate is projected economic objectives.  Since the September 2015 SEP, the median estimate of longer-run federal funds rate has been marked down, as Beth noted, from 3.5 percent to 2.9 percent.  A year ago, in considering the appropriate path of the medium rate up at subsequent SEPs, that path has the appropriate level of the funds rate consistent with your economic projections will, at the presented a couple of times The remaining panels return to an analysis that I before.  This analysis requires your longer-run projections, so I have results for only

Session September 21

YELLEN.  Good morning, everybody.  Let's get started.  I'd like to call on Steve CHAIR Kamin to discuss the Bank of Japan actions.

Chair.  Obviously, my colleagues and I were just as when we woke up to the news this morning.  Who would have guessed of these years, Brad and Angelina would have finally split up?  [Laughter] MR. KAMIN.  Thank you, Madam shocked as you all were that, after all

One of them is how to get inflation and inflation expectations is how to do that without further and those of pension financial intermediaries. By comparison, the Bank of Japan's announcement following its monetary policy meeting yesterday was more in line with expectations.  Just to back up and reiterate what Paul Wood described yesterday, the Bank of Japan has basically been struggling with two main monetary control problems of late. back up to its 2 percent target.  And the second problem flattening the yield curve and putting downward pressure on bank profits funds, insurance companies, and other so-called comprehensive that, which was announced last night, was basically two The first of these is a so-called inflation-overshooting until the a stable manner.  Now, that has at least is that the Bank of Japan it would achieve its The second aspect of that is that it committed not just to hit its target, but also exceed it.  And the third was a slight clarification, being very explicit, that the QE program achieved that slight overshoot.  It had had a soft commitment before to In response to those concerns, the Bank of Japan launched the assessment project.  The outcome of main elements of the program. commitment, in which the Bank of Japan commits itself to expand the monetary base observed rate of increase in the CPI exceeds 2 percent in two, or maybe two and a half, distinctive elements.

But this made it a little bit more concrete.  That continuing the program until it got to its target. was the first aspect of its announcement.

aspect was a so-called yield curve control aspect.  Basically, that involved a control both the short-term and the long-term aspects of the yield curve in order shallowing of the yield curve that would put excessive pressure on financial industry the Bank of Japan committed to keep the 10-year yield at zero.  It had announced a number of technical measures that might be interest rate and even making low fixedloans up to 10 years' maturity. The second commitment to to prevent a profits.  In particular, previously been below zero.  Then it used to achieve that, including buying JGBs at a fixed rate that was the basic framework that the Bank of Japan announced.  It didn't future, but the framework is forecast that the Bank of Japan would continue to make heavy might, in certain situations-greater weaknessfurther into negative territory.  But neither of those actions was In the event, really announce any concrete new actions immediately or for the broadly consistent with our earlier QE purchases over the next several years and lower the near-term policy rate taken today.

Commercial bank the goal of the program, but actually has subsequently strengthened.  Right now, it's stronger than it was before the announcement for reasons that are a little bit changed, too. The announcement was, broadly speaking, in the JGB yield moved a little bit-for the 10-year, negative.  The basic index of stock stocks rose a lot more, around 7 percent.  The yen initially weakened, which was presumably part of actually slightly unclear.  Global markets have pretty much taken everything in stride.  Foreign stock prices are up a bit.

People would just be buying at the 10-year Am I missing something? MR. ROSENGREN.  But doesn't that constrain their ability to actually go more negative?  Presumably, if you're 10-year you'd assume there'd be maturity.

Well, let's put it this way.  I think the goal is to anchor the long end so too much, giving them the freedom, in some sense, to lower the short into negative territory.

MR. POTTER.  If it is credible-you'd be taking the capital gains off it.

Are there any further questions?  [No response]  Okay. CHAIR YELLEN.

to start off our policy go-round, and I want to emphasize that today's basis of the data in hand, one person may reasonably that the economic outlook and associated risks argue for an increase in the target range looking at the same information reasonably decides that holding off is the clear cut.  This ambiguity is reflected in alternatives B and C, which present yet arrive at about what action we should take. If I might, I'd like decision is not an easy one.  On the conclude today, while another better strategy.  In contrast to many of our previous meetings, the appropriate policy decision today is not essentially the same characterization of the incoming data and the economic outlook different conclusions with the SEP, that most of inclined to support an increase in the federal funds rate before year-end if the economy We may not all agree on today's decision, but I think, in line us will be

But why not move now,as probably At our July meeting, after all, I said that raising the target range in September would if we saw reasonably strong payroll gains in July and August, which we the Jackson Hole the case for tightening had strengthened. My recommendation for likely move the economic consequences of tightening today instead of waiting until December are minimal? likely be appropriate have, and the overall outlook remained favorable, which it has.  And, at symposium, I said that

First, incoming data suggest to have a bit more running room than I'd anticipated, and I see little danger that is falling 'behind the curve.'  As I said yesterday, some slack still remains in Utilization appears to be increasing at a relatively slow pace.  There are few conditions, we can afford to proceed patiently, and doing so will promote additional market improvements and so speed the return to 2 percent inflation.

Over the past year, the labor market to have had more room to improve without creating inflation pressures than I'd expected. alternative B, 'for the time being, for further evidence of continued progress toward [our] objectives.' Furthermore, a moderately tight labor market might also pull more people back into the labor force off prematurely.  Indeed, as I noted yesterday, we have seen solid employment growth over the past year without significant declines seems This is an important reason why I'm inclined, in the words of to wait our objectives the year was anticipate or if we were to begin seeing signs of accelerating the course of to be weaker than if downside risks to the outlook were to emerge, then we would probably regret this financial markets, wild month-to-month swings in the data, and Brexitin the road are common and the concerns related to the effective lower in an environment in which we find Second, I consider waiting until we've seen somewhat more progress on advisable on risk-management grounds.

But if economic conditions were instead to turn out expected or having decided to move today.

But that's not the situation that undermining the credibility we've gained with the public over that we need to set policy in a manner consistent with the communications we continue to make. This isn't to information had changed our outlook, then we would need to change what we are communicating to the public about our anticipated policy rate we're in.  The outlook is little changed, and the consensus anticipation among participants is a gradual upward path of interest rates is appropriate.

At the moment, reluctant to weigh the evidence that we talked about yesterday on overshooting at face the time periods that we've experienced.  I do recall, as research director, We are facing hard and consequential choices points at the moment, but there's so much more.  And I look forward to more conversation about the important issues-about the I'm valueon the basis of with my former boss providing commentary and advice very much like I've heard this morning,

September 20-21, 2016

'One way to make sure we can sustain the recovery is by increasing interest rates at this how we keep the momentum going without overshooting.' about moment, because that's the overshooting evidence to date was in an environment that's very what we're facing today.  In the 1970s, in the '80s, and in the '90s, inflation was above what the Committee's objective was-in the 1970s, it was double digits-and office, percent, substantially higher than where we are and what we've committed to.  The we were not going to be moving down in a secular fashion, but we were what progress we'd made. But I believe all of different from always well the Committee was hoping just to get it down.  In the 1980s, when Chairman Volcker left it was 4 to 5 advice was always 'Let's get it down.'  So when we found ourselves overshooting, the risk was so much worse because going to lose

a very different situation, in which inflation is below our inflation respond?  It is true that, in the past, Taylor rules have captured the behaved.  But we're lower than our inflation objective, so the Lucas critique really the policy environment that the Taylor rule was is the environment that we face now?  I don't know that the answer is 'yes.'  I don't Now, today, we're in objective.  How will policy Committee's intention to raise rates to keep the economy sustainable.  Maybe that's the way the Committee bears minding at this point.  Do we know that premised on know what the right answer is to any of these questions.  I look forward to more discussion.

following comment-and I've used this 'humility,' it's almost always used in the context going to talk about what I think is the more humble channel of thing.  It's a first-mover advantage, I've always felt. I have to say, I can't refrain from making the myself.  When we use the term 'humble' or that, because I get to say it first, I'm or thought-that type

I had gone first, I could say, 'Well, it's important to be I think, about the claim that at 4.9 percent unemployment, 'We're at full employment, The Federal Reserve Act says we should seek conditions to support lot of courage, conviction, and strength of how you analyze rate naturally might be 5 percent.'  Many have that is.  My own assessment in the current environment, with inflation below our target, we can to see how much more room there is to grow.  Madam Chair, I agree with your turn back to my more prepared MR. EVANS.  And I suppose if humble,' and we can't do better.' maximum employment.  It takes a things to say, 'I think that the unemployment view, and I'm not saying it's wrong.  I don't know what the right answer is, it's lower, and I think that continue comment very much in that regard.  Now, having said that, I'll remarks, with apologies.

alternative B-no change in our policy setting today.  Although I worry that the fragile and there are many risks to the outlook, I believe market and the consumer should be adequate to support my moderately above-trend economic growth.  If core PCE inflation was I would see a readjustment of monetary policy toward its 'toward its long-run neutral because,in view of the headwinds and impediments that remain, the short-run funds rate likely is still below our longer-run assessment, and that's like what I support current expansion may be somewhat solid fundamentals for the labor baseline projections of clearly on its way to 2 percent, then long-run neutral setting as an appropriate and easy decision.  I say setting' equilibrium federal President Williams indicated yesterday.

building wage and price pressures is strong evidence for this hypothesis, in light of our long period of low interest rates.  Furthermore, inflation has been below for quite some time. The lack of especially 2 percent for many years, as Governor Brainard mentioned yesterday.  Indeed, the inflation endpoint attractor used in the Board model has been stuck near 1Â¾ percent

September 20-21, 2016

markets, in which participants are clearly much above-target thinking that forecasts that have sustainable 2 percent PCE inflation any time much more than hopes, and so we need to be very careful about adjusting policy and normalization should take. This is consistent with what we see in financial more concerned about ensuring against low-inflation outcomes than they are about inflation.  I'm left soon aren't communication surrounding the appropriate path that my public commentary, I routinely state that the FOMC has a symmetric 2 percent comment is often greeted by blank stares.  I can't recall anyone saying to rhetoric, I understand why they think like that.  This worries me we end this economic cycle with inflation still below 2 percent, I can't imagine why believe us or our future colleagues when we say our symmetric target is 2 percent. a huge problem when policy is next confronted with disinflationary forces, a zeroinflation expectations in order to lower rates enough and help right the economy.  Our complacency today and our willingness to try to get to 2 percent without any overshooting will create substantial I worry that we and our future colleagues will regret In objective.  Frankly, this me that, yes, the FOMC has clearly demonstrated a commitment to a symmetric objective.  Many see 2 percent as a hard ceiling on where we would allow inflation to go.  Again,in light of our inflation performance and public greatly.  If anyone will This will be lower-bound challenge, and the need to establish higher real to thread the needle challenges for Committees in the future. this lack of a strong and full commitment.

an elaborate theory could increase inflation and inflation highly theoretical analysis without adequate currently trumps monetary policy for inflation, my assessment shares one similar characteristic.  In the current At the Jackson Hole symposium, Chris Sims regaled us with indicating that only fiscally irresponsible policies expectations.  Although I'm unpersuaded by Sims's empirical investigation that the role of fiscal policy generating higher

1Â¾ percent up to 2 percent requires strong, confidence that our current expected environment, moving inflation expectations from bold, and explicit policy prescriptions.  I simply do not have course of policy adjustments and our existing communications regarding that path will be sufficient.

toward a rate increase later this year.  Although the path of rates after that.  When we move, we need to think carefully about how we for our subsequent rate increases.  Again, in the current requires moving the inflation attractor up from to 2 percent.  I keep saying 'attractor.'  The Board, I understand, uses 'underlying concept, it seems to me.  To do this, I believe we need than what we have in the current statement.  When we raise Â½ to Â¾ percent range, it will be important for the Committee to state explicit increases.  The statement needs to assure the public that this is seeking economic and financial conditions to support inflation attaining our inflation objective sustainably, symmetrically, and sooner rather than later.  I marker that core PCE inflation should be very close to 2 percent before this, too.  Another useful explicit to boost inflation.  And a third condition would be increases of inflation expectations in line with the Board's inflation attractor moving up to 2 from below where it's been stuck for quite some time. Alternative B leans very heavily current debate is over when we make the next move, the larger issue is how we're going to decide on a will characterize the conditions environment, I believe achieving our target 1Â¾ percent inflation,' but that seems to bury the real more explicit policy prescriptions rates to the conditions governing further Committee 2 percent PCE would prefer an explicit we move rates again.

Or, in the words of Tealbook B, page 35, I not much additional evidence would be needed to warrant a rate hike,' and I the Tealbook's request that I so indicate in my statement. MR. FISCHER.

like to highlight a few points they make with their presentation refers to the solid average gain in payroll months as indicating that there have been increases in labor utilization. because the unemployment rate has, on net, remained constant beginning of the year, there has been little increase in labor utilization.  I even mention the increase in the labor force I judge that labor factor in assessing the current state of the labor The staff's presentation is valuable, but I'd which I do not fully agree.

And, accordingly, utilization should also be regarded as a positive market.

discussion of the case for alternative B, the staff starts by 'may judge it prudent to wait for more evidence to grow at a moderate pace and that the labor market will before raising the interest rate.  They then give three arguments for job gains have rebounded since May, the unemployment rate and indicators have changed little since the beginning of the year.  A further wait 'could allow assess underlying trends in employment, productivity, and inflation.' interest rate, but a number of factorsin labor utilization, and low wage and price since the start of the year-may have reduced FOMC voters' confidence in the view policy provides considerable accommodation.

They are valid, and they are decision to take action, any serious decisionmaker has to examine and take into account and decide that they're argument the staff makes for being hesitant to move is that the nominal interest is close to the effective lower bound, which limits the ability of monetary policy to respond staff's view is, this seems to me to be a reason, policy reserve to deal with future negative is interest rates countries.  That is to say, I think that relative interest rates would likely not have been rate on some previous occasions.  This subject, the effect of our we should give more attention at as a follower and not as a leader, and we are the leaders in the global economy. The third rate to negative shocks.  My second doubt about the when a decision is close, to move-to build up a shocks.  In saying that, I should add that I believe the global level of the nominal interest rate set primarily by the United States, and that decisions by us would have affected the of other very different had we raised our policies on those of other countries, is one to which I believe some point in the near future.

a fourth point that is frequently made in favor of waiting-that we know how is typically love.  And that is what we will face if we don't move in time. Let me add to deal with high inflation if it comes.  We do, but we also know that dealing with high inflation, if it comes, requires a 'tough love' approach where, unfortunately, the toughness more needed than the there's a strong case for waiting, which means that I support B and expect that if the economy continues on its current course, we should raise the funds rate at our December meeting.

On the basis of all of this-and the fact that, near effective lower bound, there is unlikely to be a good time to raise rates-I would prefer that funds rate 25 basis points today and emphasize, using the SEP that's coming path of rates is likely to be historically shallow, and that the terminal rate is likely to removals of accommodation will be done only in a gradual and I've been in favor, as to become a that the we raise the federal out, that the be lower than has been widely expected.

For example, my understanding of first-difference use might fit well during such a time of uncertainty.  Here, too, of a first-difference rule has been prescribing a this year.

It does actually be using up a margin of slack, but there

am comfortable with alternative B, but I A.  I prefer alternative A because I would like to see evidence of rising pressure before tightening.  In particular, I'm looking for either a sustained upward inflation or evidence of rising inflation expectations or a substantial decline in unemployment rate.  The discussion we had yesterday about workers coming off the unemployment rate.  The truth is that we don't know left.  It seems to me that there is still some more slack.  I'd like to find out MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I lean toward alternative inflationary move in core PCE the headline sidelines-it's not moving the headline how much slack is

the Tealbook and its staff forecast of core PCE inflation of 1.6 percent for I asked myself, 'If that's right, what would it take to to want to move?'  I'd want to see inflation expectations climb, or I'd want to see the rate fall meaningfully, such that I had confidence that slack had actually here, President President Evans, that I don't see a strong case for raising rates.  Alternative A lays want to see meaningful progress toward our inflation target, and I think that would be helpful.

Absent that, I'm starting to get persuaded by my neighbors Bullard and down a marker that we that

B isn't terrible, but I'm a little nervous about the language, because I do think to the market that a rate hike is coming.  It may not come, and I think we all agree that we put out a marker that it's about to come and then we don't deliver, there's a cost to of our credibility.  So I'm nervous about alternative B being too strong in signaling a rate increase. Alternative it signals every time us in terms December going to raise rates so that we don't fall 'behind the I think each of us reads these optimal control simulations and takes what we want out of I don't see where the concern is.  If is 2.2 percent inflation, that's less of an overshoot than we're Now, some say that we need to get curve.' them, because I look at them and, even in the most accommodative scenarios, the overshoot is 2.2 percent inflation.  So if these things are valuable at all, the worst-case scenario undershooting right now.

September 20-21, 2016

of 2014, a background memo on potential implications of alternative approaches to the tightening.  This memo by Board staff suggests that it's entirely unclear that a and steep path of tightening is somehow more recessionary than a gradual path.  So I don't wrong, but it doesn't where economic growth is-it's inflation is definitely below target, I think we should be patient and allow anticipating inflation that may not come. memo timing and pace of late find those arguments persuasive.  I'm not saying one is right and one is appear to be clear that one is better than the other. In view of pretty slow-and that the data to come to us before we are is, I know this makes me sound like I'm an uber-dove or a When the data reveal themselves-when inflation actually materializes or raising rates.

However, it may be the best language that the rather divergent views of people here.  But I did want to little bit uncomfortable with it.

to say a couple of things about the discussion that's gone back and forth, both in which there's good reason to believe that the structure and dynamics of the really quite different from what they have been in the relatively recent past period.  And what I think that indicates is the possibility that analytic frameworks, such as various correlations among economic variables, that for some period of time in thinking about and setting monetary policy may less useful, because the precedent just abstracts important That first observation the idea that things may be different and thus that you don't take rule or the traditional understanding of the Phillips curve or of other analytical frameworks-as your presumptive path.  From there-and, as I humility comes in-we, as policymakers, don't then want to jump to the we're pretty confident about the way in which we I did want in part of the go-round yesterday and today.  This is not exactly on the humility point, but we are in an environment U.S. economy are and through much of the postwar tools and even were quite useful have more limited utility in the current circumstances.  What, of course, goes along with that is the idea that historical precedent becomes rather a couple of things and pulls them out of the broader context in which various more secular forces are affecting the structure and dynamics of the economy. counsels more openness to some things-whether it's the Taylor any number said, this is where conclusion of, 'Ah, we now understand the way the dynamics and structure in this different economy are actually functioning, and thus will set policy.'

taken a similar approach-it seemed to me that allow us to make policy decisions from something So that is why-and I think a number of people, even though they haven't used the language, and other people around the table have we have to develop at least operating presumptions that meeting to meeting.  But we need to be more open than usual to the possibility that

September 20-21, 2016

is where my difference with alternative A comes in-what I've more evidence that inflation would be moving toward the For me, that doesn't necessarily translate into the itself moving there, because I can imagine that there would be evidence of an in certain parts of the economy that suggested pretty convincingly that, things going on, inflation was going to rise.  So I think, again, one can be a little used, that inflation will move back to target. Just to be clear-and this been saying is, I would like to see 2 percent target on a sustainable basis. inflation rate underlying dynamic because of other bit more open minded about what it is that would be evidence that would give reasonable certainty, to invoke a past phrase we comparative longer-term risk framework.  By the way, let me just say it set of issues that at least half a dozen or eight of us were discussing But I haven't consulted with anybody beyond Presidents George and Rosengren on even endorse it.  They just said, 'That's interesting.'  [Laughter] And the second thing, obviously, that's been important to me is what we discussed yesterday, which is the explicitly today-boy, talk about a heterodox idea-it would be great to dispense with the economic go-round, as conventionally done, in November and just come in prepared to have a conversation about the yesterday. this, and they didn't

Finally-notwithstanding my reservations about some of the language in B-obviously, when it comes to a vote today, I'll vote for alternative B and do so the evidence on inflation or my understanding of that couple of meetings.

Of course, as contains risks.  In particular, if momentum in the economy is Even so, actual progress how close the economy is to full employment.  To me, it seems, therefore, appropriate to continue and tightening of resource constraints before many have noted, that policy stance much stronger than the data now suggest and resource constraints start to bind more quickly than I currently anticipate, then inflation could rise more quickly than expected.  In such a contingency, we have tried-and-tested tools and ample policy space in which to react.

First, experience, in particular, of the past year, it reminds us that it is possible material Moreover, there are several lead us to expect that the effects of such unexpected strength economy more generally, will be somewhat more modest and require a somewhat more tempered policy due to the

Together, these factors suggest that the response of modest and gradual, requiring a costs to the economy. resource slack still remains, and that full employment in the look a bit different.  Second, the recent elevated surprises suggests that an appreciating currency would play an important role excess demand and restraining inflation.  Third, because be persistently low, the distance back to a neutral expectations are well anchored to the inflation to unexpected strength in demand will likely be correspondingly moderate policy response and implying relatively slight shock, however, our conventional policy toolkit is very limited, risk of being unable to respond adequately is greater.  The experience of the euro-area economies should be sobering and suggests that prolonged weakness in to correct, leading to economic costs that can be considerable.  In short, think of as today's new normal, the costs to the economy of greater-than-expected lower than the costs of significant unexpected weakness. In the face of an adverse and thus the Japanese and demand is very difficult in what I strength in demand are likely to be

another question that's been raised that is important in this context that I wanted asking whether there really is a cost to signaling that the is comfortable acquiescing in underlying inflation remaining in the 1.4 to 1.6 percent it hasn't meaningfully exceeded over the past several years.  In the 'new normal,' perceived inflation target reduces to an have in which to respond to a in thinking it's extremely important that we defend the target and make clear through our actions that there really is symmetry around There's to address briefly address.  Some are Committee range, which in which the long-run neutral rate may well be 1Â¼ to 1Â½ percentage points below the canonical Taylor 2 percent, every Â½ point reduction in our uncomfortably tight margin the conventional policy space we shock.  For that reason, I join others credibility of the

I entrenching a approach has served us well and will continue to do so.  When we the language, I must say that I, too, have some concerns about locking ourselves in to end of the year.  That approach hasn't worked so well for us previously. recognize there's a large diversity of views around the table, and I'm very Chair's preferred formulation in alternative B.  Thank you. The asymmetry in risk management counsels prudence in the removal of policy accommodation.  I believe this look at moving before the Nonetheless, I also comfortable supporting the

I support alternative B as written, although I do have some unease about how forward leaning it is in market is going to take it as making remarks.  But I can as financial conditions have eased, near-term Brexit risks have receded, and the pace of case sufficiently compelling to move today for reasons.  I think this is very similar to what the Chair said in her earlier remarks.  First, the coming back into the workforce, augmenting the supply of rate broadly stable this year and wage gains still subdued, I don't a labor market that signals there's urgency to tighten right now.  And I would really be unemployment rate.  I think that would be unconscionable. Although I agree that the case for tightening monetary policy has strengthened in recent months economic growth has picked up, I don't find the three economy is just not growing that fast.  The pressure on labor utilization is increasing very slowly, and discouraged workers are labor.  With the unemployment see hesitant to keep a bunch of people out of work on the presumption that somehow we're already at the full-employment

Now, before, that was just a forecast, is now being realized is significant.  The core PCE price moving sideways rather than upward on a year-over-year basis.  I think that and the fact inflation has been consistently below our 2 percent objective, and the potential consequences Second, inflation is still target for some time a sequential basis, but I think the fact that the forecast index is that of that on inflation expectations, also argue for patience.

is not very accommodative.  I think this is a pretty widely held has narrowed.  I would judge that a neutral monetary policy regime points above where we are now.  So that gap think the and there would be more work to do to move that was the case, that would push you on the side of moving Third, monetary policy view in this room.  The gap between where we are and where we judge the neutral short-term rate, the so-called r *, to be currently is likely no more than 100 to 150 basis could be closed quite quickly if we needed to do so.  If the gap was larger, then I economy would presumably be growing faster policy back toward neutral.  So if more quickly, but I don't think that's where we are right now.

if we mostly agree that there's going to be only one move this year and the is really between today versus December, I ask the obvious question:  Why not wait to see moving?  At the end of and I think that'll be something that you With I will feel less bad if it turns out a hike was justified today on the subsequent data and we move a few months later, compared with a situation in which the Finally, debate whether a more favorable GDP growth trend actually emerges before October, we'll get the GDP data for the third quarter, can hang your hat on in terms of why you're tightening monetary policy subsequently. inflation below our objective, basis of economy disappoints, suggesting that we really shouldn't have moved at today's meeting.

I think to its historical norm of 2 percent and will remain sodue to slower productivity persistence of a global savings glut.  Also, I've become the story we've been telling for some time, that the headwinds following the relatively soon.  So that also feeds into my reassessment of rate is likely to be. For the SEP, I've got one further 25 basis point rate hike for 2016, two for '17, and three for '18, and that takes the reduced my longer-run federal funds r * is depressed relative growth, an aging population, and the more skeptical of financial crisis are likely to dissipate what the long-term federal funds in terms of language, I think we should have no illusions.  The market is going to today as making December highly likely.  I think there are several are going to push in that direction.  First, I view the statement language as market generally expects.  If you look at the surveys of the primary them didn't really see a lot of changes as likely occurring in the There are two changes that I think are going to be important.  One is the movement of to 'roughly balanced.'  I think people who thought that might change were more likely to 'nearly'-by a little bit. the phrase 'for the time being,' putting in the time component there, will, I think, I think, is also going to do the work in the same direction. in 2016, so it'll be the strong sense of the that the Committee expects a rate hike this year.  And the fact that we're going to a relatively large Now, react to what we put out aspects of that that stronger than what the dealers and the buy side, most of statement. risks think 'nearly balanced,' but 'roughly,' I guess, is closer to neutral than The second thing is, this language that the case has strengthened-I don't think that will surprise people.  But push in the same direction.  The SEP, All but three of us have one or two rate hikes Committee have three dissents on the side of tightening at this meeting-three dissents is number of dissents.  That'll also push in the same direction.

Thank you, Madam Chair. So I don't think we should be surprised if the probability for December goes up.  I don't think that's to be a problem, because it's going to be another case of shrinking back from

YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  I think we've had a really great discussion of staff-before our next if there's some further work we can do to try to analyze the various risks CHAIR the issues and done an excellent job of identifying the key risks that we face on both sides as we try to decide the appropriate path of policy.  And I will work with the meeting, I hope-to see that have been identified here.
