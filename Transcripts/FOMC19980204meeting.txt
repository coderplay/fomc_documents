MR. FISHER.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  will e  referring    the hree  ages b to t p of  color harts  hat  ere  placed n  front  f  you  before he eeting tarted. c t w i o t m s 1/

The first ge  updates he harts    have  shown before n  current  nd  forward pa t c I o a three-month  eposit  ates.  n  this  ase,  m presenting  full  3 months  of  data o d r I c Ia a 1 s you  can  see ecent  evelopments n he ontext  f  a  longer eriod f ime. f  ou r d i t c o p o t I y look  at he op anel,  hown in  red,  ou can  see  the brupt ownward  shift  .S. t t p s y a d inU forward  rates  hat  ccurred ight  fter  he ew  Year.  I  think  t  s nteresting t t o r a t N i i i tha not  much else as  happened  other  han n  abrupt  ove down. The forward ates h t a m r do  not  show much  of   rising te nvironment r  falling te xpectations. ey a ra e o ra e Th are  flat  nd  right  n  top f ne  another fter  heir wnward  shift,  ich  I ill a o o o a t do wh w come back  to  in  a  minute. he flattening   he orward eposit  ate  urves eally T oft f d r c r began  in  late  ctober hen the  Dow  lost  54  points.  t s uite  ramatic ow flat O w 5 I i q d h

the  forward urves f  expected hree-month  ates  ave  become for he  United c o t r h t States.

Looking  at he  middle  panel or ermany, shown in  blue,  ou can  see  the t f G y continued  odest  decline  n  German  forward ates.    think  his  ontinues  o  reflect m i r I t c t three actors.  irst,  ere  s   widening onsensus hat  hen the uropean  central f F th i a c t w E bank  comes into xistence  2 months  from  now,  the nitial  licy  ate  s ikely  o e 1 i po r i l t be  in  the id  to  low  3 percent  ange,  nd  that  s own from  market xpectations m r a i d e of higher ates.   hink here as  been  a  widening  appreciation at  he sian  crisis r It t h th t A will ave  a  greater  mpact n urope  than he uropeans  initially ught,  nd  that h i i E t E tho a has  begun  to  weigh  on  the utlook  or conomic  activity   urope.  I  believe  hose o f e inE t two  developments ombine  to  create    third  actor  n  that  he arket  really es c a f i t m se very  little  sk  f   pickup n  activity    the erman economy or  the uropean ri o a i in G E economy more generally  n  the  months ahead, o  rates  ave  been  winding  down in i s h Europe.

In  the reen  bottom  panel,  ou  can  see  at he ower ight  hat  here  as  been g y t l r t t h some rise  n  forward ate  xpectations   Japan  as  we have  moved into he ew i r e in t N Year, ut he  curve  is till  ry  flat.  find t nteresting t  he orward ates  ave b t s ve I i i tha t f r h backed  up  a  little,   he ise  s ot lose o eing  as  dramatic s  the ovements in butt r i n c t b a m the  Nikkei nd  the en  in eaction  o hat  the arkets ave  seen  as  a  very a y r t w m h aggressive  ove by  the  Ministry  f inance  to ry o  stabilize  e inancial ctor m o F t t th f se and  undertake ome stimulus  n  the conomy. I  think t  s oteworthy hat  he s i e i i n t t forward ates  epicted  ere  are owhere  near he  levels  hat  hey eached ast  ay r d h n t t t r l M when there ast  as something f  a  burst  f ptimism, n he  Japanese ontext  t l w o o o i t c a least, garding  he ossibility t  he ax  impact hat  ame in  with  this  iscal ar re t p ha t t t c f ye might  not e  as  bad  as  feared,  nd  there  ere  some hopes  the apanese conomy b a w J e might  start  ecovering.  he  point ere  is hat  e are  not ven  near hose evels r T h t w e t l even  if  here  s ome modest  uptick  n  the apanese orward ates. t i s i J f r

Turning  to  the econd age,   would  like  o elve nto he  question  f ow to s p I t d i t o h interpret  cent  ovements in  the .S.  Treasury ield  urve.  In  the op  panel,  ou re m U y c t y can  see  30-, 0-, nd  2-year reasury ields  n  green  and  the mplied ed unds 1 a T y i i f f effective  te n  red rom  the pril ed  funds utures  ontracts   they raded  n ra i f A f f c as t i December and  January.   would  like o  step ack  and  give  a  little  ckground.  In I t b ba December,  as  yields  nd  the ield  urve  were  pressing  ower,  here  ere  a  number a y c l t w of  market  participants,  elf ncluded, o thought hat  ith  the tart  f he  new mys i wh t w s o t year e would begin  to  see  a  modest  backup  in ields.  he backup  was  not w y T expected o  be  dramatic,  ut t  as  thought hat  ields  ould  rise  t east  o he t b i w t y w a l t t levels  hat  xisted  n arly  ecember. This  would  occur  as  a  consequence  of he t e i e D t unwinding  of   year-end light  uality  hen investors re  rushing  ut  of a f oq w we o emerging  markets nd  into  .S.  Treasuries. e thought  as this  ould  begin o a U Th w w t unwind  itself  ring anuary. n  particular,  anagers  of  a  number of  major du J I them mortgage-backed ecurities  rtfolios  ok hat  iew.  They  may have  gone  home s po to t v for he  New  Year  holiday omewhat short  f  their  ormal  duration  argets th  the t s o n t wi

idea hat  hey  would  be  able o  catch p  more easily  n  the ently  ising eld t t t u i g r yi environment hey  expected o  see  in  January. t t

At  the tart  f he ear,  here ere  three  urprises r he arket  that  ame very s o t y t w s fo t m c quickly nd  changed  that  utlook  ather  ramatically. e was a  shift a o r d On in expectations r onetary  policy.  he second  was a  rather  udden  jump in emand fo m T s d for reasuries  nd  other ecurities  emming  from  the sian  crisis,  me actual  nd T a s st A so a some anticipated  mand. The third  as  confirmation  f  a  changed  outlook  n he de w o i t supply  of reasury ecurities.  t  me go over  each  of  those. T s Le

The first  me as  a  result   the hairman's peech, nd  its  arket  effect ca of C s a m is depicted  n  the rea f he  chart  ssociated th he  line arked "January  ." The i a o t a wi t m 3 Chairman discussed  he  problems  of rice  easurement  in   low  inflation t p m a environment,  nd  over hat eekend  the  market  interpreted  s omments to  mean a t w hi c that  he ommittee  and  the ederal eserve  had  moved to  a  symmetric  outlook  n t C F R o the  risks  or olicy.  ater hat  eek,  after  overnor  Meyer's peech  on  January , f p L t w G s 8 which  included    discussion  f asing,  he arket umped on  that  art f he a o e t m j p o t speech  and  interpreted   s  meaning  that  he ommittee probably  ad  a  slight as ita t C h bi toward  an  easing ove or, f  ou will,  hat  he reater  robability  s now in  the m i y t t g p wa direction   an  easing n  policy.    am not  passing  udgment n  whether ither of i I j o e of these nterpretations  resented  fair  eading f he exts, t  that  s he  way the i rep a r o t t bu i t market  interpreted  em.  So,  by  the nd  of hat  irst ek in  January,  here as a th e t f we t w quite ignificant  ift  n  expectations r he  stance f onetary  policy. s sh i fo t o m

Two  other hings  appened  that  eek. One,  at he eginning f  January here t h w t b o t was a  further arp  depreciation   a  number of ast  Asian  currencies   business sh of E as corporations   those ountries  ushed nto he  markets o  try o  hedge  their in c r i t t t exposures or he  new year.  It as a  rather  am-handed, nexperienced fort f t w h i ef to hedge  their  ollar  xposures. hey had  avoided he hin arkets n  December in d e T t t m i the  expectation  umping  into he hick  arkets  of anuary,  ut  they ound  that ofj t t m J b f they ere causing he  currencies   move rapidly  way from  them.  That  gave  a w t to a further ost o  the  dollar  nd  a  further  nticipation   ery  strong  emand coming bo t a a ofv d into he reasury arket. t T m

The third  actor, t o  be  overlooked,  s hat  n  Monday, January  ,  the hite f no t i t o 5 W House announced  its  xpectation at he  fiscal dget or  1999  would  be  in e th t bu f balance. hile  the  market  knew developments ere  moving  in  that  irection,  at W w d th news hit he arket  the  same day  that  t  ad  its  irst portunity   respond o  the t m i h f op to t Chairman's peech  over  that  eekend. s w

All  of hese evelopments aken  together,  ich  may have  caught ome of  the t d t wh s major  players  lightly  ort  f  their  uration  argets,  d o  something f  a  rush. s sh o d t le t o You can  see  in he  top anel f hart  that  n  the irst ek in  January oth  the t p o C 2 i f we b 2-year nd  the  10-year ates  oved down through he ed  funds arget  ate  evel a r m t f t r l depicted  y  the olid  lack orizontal ne.   think he  challenge  s ow to eigh  or b s b h i I t i h w

untangle he  three ifferent  ctors: e  shift   expectations,  e upply,  nd  the t d fa th in th s a demand factors  nfluencing e  market. i th

In  the iddle  panel n the eft, e mplied  ields  n  fed unds  futures  re m o l th i y i f a depicted  rom  now through ugust.  The implied ed  funds  rate urves re  shown f A f c a for ecember 16,  the ate f he  Committee's  ast  eeting,  or anuary ,  the nd D d o t l m f J 9 e of  that  irst ady  week of anuary,  nd  for ast  riday,  anuary 0, hen rates f he J a l F J 3 w backed  up a  little.    the ight  anel s   snapshot f he reasury ield  urve or In r p i a o t T y c f the  same three  ates. s I  look  at he ed  funds ate  urves n he anel n  the eft, d A t f r c i t p o l I  see  hat  he arket  is ricing  ome probability  t ot  the ertainty  n  easing t t m p s bu n c ofa action.  t s ot  a  particularly ong xpectation at  olicy  ill e  eased ny  time I i n str e th p w b a in  the ext ix onths,  but learly at  s he  direction ere  the  probabilities  . n s m c th i t wh lie

With regard  o  the reasury  ield urves hown in  the iddle  panel n  the ight, t T y c s m o r many market  participants  ok  at he act hat  he  2-year  ote  is ow trading lo t f t t n n significantly  ow  the  funds ate nd  take hat  s  a  very trong ign r  conviction bel r a t a s s o that  n  easing ove is ear t and.  Indeed,  ver he  last  ecade  each  time hat  he a m n a h o t d t t 2-year  ote as  traded efinitively ough he  funds ate,  here  as  been  an  easing n n h d thr t r t h i policy  ithin he  following  hree  onths.  So,  there  s ome historical  ckground w t t m i s ba for hat  iew. But  I  believe  t  s mportant  o  keep  in ind when we try  o  interpret t v i i i t m t the  yield  urve hat  he  fed unds utures  ontracts d  the orward ates  uggest  nly c t t f f c an f r s o some probability    an  easing  n  policy  ather  han   certainty.  en  I  look  at he of i r t a Wh t yield urve,    see  a  strong  onviction  hat  here ill  e  no  tightening thin he ext c I c t t w b wi t n six onths,  and  I  think  hat  onviction  s ermitting e ather  ovel  set  f emand m t c i p th r n o d and  supply onditions   migrate nto he  intermediate ctor  f  the  curve nd  thereby c to i t se o a promote  greater  onfidence  mong investors at  hey an  carry  -  and  5-year aper c a th t c 2 p without he  risk  f  a  backup  in ates  nduced y  the ommittee. t o r i b C

I  would  note wo  things.  irst, e ntire  ill  urve,  ven  in he  1-year ector, t F th e b c e t s was already  elow  the  federal  unds  rate  t he ime  of he ommittee's  ast b f a t t t C l meeting.  Moreover,  while he  entire  ield urve--from   months  to  30  years r  3 t y c 3 o months  to  10  years epending n how you slice  t--  as  declined    bit  ver he d o i h a o t intermeeting riod,  he  coupon  curve  from  2 to  30  years ctually  teepened  ver pe t a s o the  same even  as  it hifted ightly  wer.  So,  while here  learly  as  been  a  shift s sl lo t c h in  policy  xpectations    the arket,   for ne  do  not hink  t s s  pronounced  as  a e in m I o t i i a straight  ading f he  intermediate ctor  f  the ield  urve  might  lead ne  to re o t se o y c o conclude.

In  the ottom  panel f age  2,  you  can  see he ovements in  the ollar  nd  get b o p t m d a a  sense f he  run-up n  the  dollar  hat  ccurred t he nd  of ast  ear nd  the irst o t i t o a t e l y a f few days  of his  ear. learly,  he en  strengthened er  the  course f anuary s t y C t y ov o J a the  Ministry  f inance orked very  hard  to  communicate  their  ntent   stabilize o F w i to the  financial ctor  f he  Japanese conomy.  I  would  note hat  he ollar/mark  s se o t e t t d i very  little  anged  over he eriod rom  the igh  levels  t  eached t  the nd  of he ch t p f h i r a e t year.

Turning  to  the ast  age  of harts,  will  riefly scuss  ur  open  market l p c I b di o operations  uring he eriod.   would like  o  make just    few  points.  irst,    the d t p I t a F in first intenance eriod hown on  the  left  ide f he pper  panel,  e had  both ma p s s o t u w pronounced  softness  n  the arket  around he hristmas oliday nd  then he i m t C h a t year-end ressures; , e had  a  ying-yang aintenance eriod.  e  tried  o p so w m p W t manage both  that oftness d  then  the  firmness.  n  the ext  maintenance eriod, s an I n p which ended  January 4,  we began  the  period  y  adding eserves, t e 1 b r bu w subsequently  ad  repeated  ays  of og-induced  loat  hat  ed o   certain  ogginess h d f f t l t a s in  the arket.  So, e ended  up  being n  the ther  ide f he  market,  raining m w o o s o t d reserves  hat  esulted om  a  considerable se  n loat.  arly n  the hird  eriod, t r fr ri i f E i t p on  January 6,  the nexpected ize  f  corporate  ax ayments  led o   miss  of ust 1 u s o t p t a j under  $3 billion   our  projection  he reasury alance. hat  contributed    a in oft T b T to very  high ed  funds ate,  hich  rose s  high  as  20  percent  n  that  ay, nd  there f r w a o d a was some borrowing  from  the  discount  indow. So,  January 6 was  one  of he w 1 t difficult  ys  we faced uring his  eriod.    would  note hat  n he urrent riod da d t p I t i t c pe just  nder  way,  which  is ot epicted  ere,  e again ere  supplying  eserves  n u n d h w w r i the  last  ew  days  in  anticipation  the ettlement  new Treasury ecurities f of s on s yesterday.  oday,  we have  been  draining  eserves.  e  knew we would  in  fact T r W have  this  eightened  emand yesterday, t e anticipated  ggy  conditions   we h d bu w so as came to  the nd  of he eriod. e t p

I  would  also ike  o ention  something ot  depicted  n  these harts  o ake l t m n i c t m sure  the ommittee  members are  all  ware  of  the ransactions    question.  ust C a t in J before hristmas,  e confronted  n  order rom  the  Japanese uthorities  sell C w a f a to in  Treasury  ills.   the  absence f b In o

We  took of  bills to he  SOMA in t account, selecting lls  hat  e would  be  able o  run  off  n he  course f anuary o  as  not bi t w t i t o J s to  make our  need  to  drain  eserves  ny  worse  at he nd  of he onth.

MR.  PRELL.  The next  two  charts  ocus n  the  dynamics  of  private  emand in f o d the  forecast. rst,    Chart ,  the pper  left  anel hows real  CE  growth  holding Fi in 8 u p s P at   high  rate or    while onger nd  then ropping ff  o  2 percent  n  1999.

As I  noted arlier,   are xpecting  he arket  to  give ack  a  small  share f e we e t m b o its  ain, ausing he  wealth-income atio  o  fall  ff--as own by  the lack ine  n g c t r t o sh b l i the  middle  left  anel. he experience  f  the ast ear  has  reinforced r  belief p T o p y ou in the  significance   he ealth ffect  n consumption;  hus,  e are  predicting at oft w e o t w th the ersonal aving ate ill rop  further er  the  next ew  quarters  n  lagged p s r w d ov f i response o  last  ear's  arket  advance  and  then evel  ut n  1999. t y m l o i

An added  attraction    the tory  f  strong  onsumer  demand is  the urrent in s o c c wave of  mortgage  refinancing. e run-up n  the  MBA Th i refinancing plications ap series, otted  t he  right, obably  xaggerates  he  relative mension f he pl a t pr e t di o t interest vings  hat  ill e realized   households n  this  pisode,  ut here sa t w b by i e b t should e  enough  to ive  a  small ift   spending. he  decline  n  mortgage  rates b g l to T i obviously  as  made home purchase ore affordable.  s documented  at he h m A t lower  left, r  usual easure  of he ash  flow  burden  of wnership  shows  that, ou m t c o by this  riterion,  is he est ime  in  decades or he  average amily o uy a c now t b t f t f t b house.  In  our orecast,  is  emains  so, nd--with  ittle  pply f  unsold ew units f th r a l su o n overhanging he  market--we  see  single-family  using  starts lding p  well t ho ho u through ext  year, espite  he  slowing f ob  growth.  A very  close nspection n d t o j i of

the  right  anel,  erhaps equiring  magnifying lass,  hows  that ultifamily p p r a g s m starts--the dish  pper  layer--spurted he  fourth  uarter  f  1997. We  do  not red u in  t q o expect hat  igher evel  o  be  sustained--although re ay be  some upside isk t h l t the m r here, iven  the enerous vailability  financing  or evelopers.  he bottom  line g g a of f d T is hat  esidential  vestment, ich  rose ubstantially  1997,  is ikely   flatten t r in wh s in l to out  soon  and  then dge  lower. e

Softening  xport nd  consumer  demand will  end o  cause usinesses  o rim e a t t b t t their  apital  pending rograms  over  the oming  months--the  o-called celerator c s p c s ac effects.  he upper  left  anel f hart   shows that  hrough ome large uarterly T p o C 9 t s q gyrations  ndicated   the ed  line, al  usiness  ixed  nvestment  emained  on  a i by r re b f i r strong rowth  trend ast  ear. e  foresee    notable  lowing ut  not  a  collapse. g l y W a s b Indeed,  s  indicated  he  right,  estimate  hat  he evel f pending ill ustain a att we t t l o s w s the ecent   percent-plus owth  of he  business  apital ock hrough he  next wo r 3 gr t c st t t t years.

This  is igh  enough  to roduce  further zable  ncreases  he  amount  of h p si i int capital  er orker.  Among  the orces  purring  his  apital epening s he  rapid p w f s t c de i t decline  n  the rice f omputers, hown in  the  middle eft  anel. he i p o c s l p T combination f  further  rice eductions  nd  increasing wer  should e  enough  to o p r a po b keep  real omputer  purchases  n a  steep rowth  trajectory. c o g

Orders  for ondefense apital ods, x  aircraft,  own at he  right, ve n c go e sh t ha waffled   bit  n ecent  onths, ut  from  what  we hear,  e do  not hink  his  s a i r m b w t t i a major  turning  oint n  domestic quipment pending.   might  note hat,   the p i e s I t in near erm, his  eries  ill ave  to  be  read ith  extra aution  hen gauging he t t s w h w c w t strength  f  domestic urchases. nternational  ade  s ery  important  n  this o p I tr i v i sector, d  by  all  eports--and  rhaps eflected    yesterday's PM an r pe r in NA survey-equipment  orders rom  Asia  have  begun  to  weaken.

Another  key  element  in  the rojected onomic  deceleration  is  ear  is p ec th y inventories. nfarm stocks  ose  around  5 percent  ast  ear, learly No r l y c an unsustainable  te. e  are  expecting    deceleration er  the  next ew  quarters ra W a ov f to roughly  percent.  Admittedly,  e have  been  telling  is  tory  or ome time. 2 w th s f s Perhaps,  owever,  the isk  f  another  pside urprise s  been  diminished  y  the h r o u s ha b rise  f he  stock-sales tio  hat  ou  can  see  in he ight  anel. n  retrospect, o t ra t y t r p I it looks  like  irms ound hemselves  ith  leaner-than-desired  entories   he  end f f t w inv att of ast  ear nd  have  been  restocking--with   added  ingredient  he  Boeing l y a e oft production  amp-up.  Of  course,  ith  no  broad verhang  of nwanted  stocks  t r w o u a this  oint,  ny  upside urprise  n inal  emand relative    our  forecast uld gain p a s i f d to co a be  reinforced   an  inventory  esponse. by r

Let  me turn ow to  the  question  f he  implications  he rojected owth  for n o t oft p gr inflationary  essures.  hart  10 shows  some key  features   our  labor arket pr C of m forecast.  n  the pper anel,  ou can  see  that  e expect   slowing f abor I u p y w a o l productivity  owth  in  the ear  term  and  then   return  o oughly rend  rowth  in gr n a t r t g 1999. As we noted  in  the reenbook,  a  number of onsiderations  me into lay G c ca p in  this  orecast,  t entral  s hat  here ill  e  some lag n  the djustment  f f bu c i t t w b i a o hours  and  employment  to  the  slowing f  output  rowth. o g

Certainly,    this  oint  here  s o  sign f   major  slackening  n  hiring.  nitial at p t i n o a i I claims nd  a  variety  f ther ndicators  ggest hat  he anuary nd  February a o o i su t t J a labor arket  reports  ill how still zable  ncreases   payrolls--albeit  on  the m w s si i in no scale f  those eported  or he ourth  uarter.  ut  we expect irms o espond o r f t f q B f t r before ong  to  the vidence f  softening  emand,  and--as  ou  can  see  at he l e o d y t middle  left--we e  looking  or onthly  payroll  ncreases   drop  below 100,000 ar f m i to this  pring. s

On the  other ide f  the edger,  e do  not oresee  ny  significant  vements s o l w f a mo in  the abor  orce  articipation e.  reduced  growth  in ob  opportunities  ll l f p rat A j wi tempt  fewer  people o  enter  he  labor  arket, alancing  ff   modest  positive t t m b o a effect  f  welfare  eform. o r

On balance,  s  I  noted arlier is  ll esults   a  rise  n  the nemployment a e th a r in i u rate,  ut ot  to hat  we would  regard s  implying he bsence  of age pressures. b n w a t a w The latest I release  howed a  big ump in  compensation n  the  fourth  uarter, EC s j i q which  we are iscounting avily  n  our  assessment  f ngoing  trends.  irst, d he i o o F we always  downplay  the uarterly mbers  because hey  are  so  noisy;  ut,  econd,  n q nu t b s i the  present  ase hey eem to  have  been  importantly fluenced  y  a  few c t s in b non-recurrent dustry  evelopments nd  the  minimum  wage hike.  That  said,  e in d a w do believe  hat  he ightness   the abor arket  gave  an underlying  ift  he t t t of l m l ot trend f  compensation  gains ast  ear,  specially    the age side. ur  forecast, o l y e on w O however,  is hat  age increases  ill iminish lightly  is  ear  and  next,  wing to t w w d s th y o the  lagged ffects  f alling ice  nflation  d  inflation  pectations. anwhile, e o f pr i an ex Me benefit  ost ncreases e  expected  o  be a  little  rger, ing  primarily   rising c i ar t la ow to health nsurance  remiums. The net  outcome, abulated  he  right,    slight i p t att isa drop-back n  compensation nflation   ust  ver  3 percent  y 1999. i i toj o b

If ne  viewed  prices  s  being etermined n he  short  un  by  a  mark-up  over o a d i t r trend nit abor  osts,  his  ight  suggest    pretty  anguine utlook  or rice u l c t m a s o f p inflation.   alternative  ew,  though, s hat  he  more  reliable deling An vi i t t mo approach  is o  link  rice  nflation  rectly   resource  tilization,  ting ges and t p i di to u let wa the  share f ncome  going  to  labor  e  a  side how. But, n mplementing his o i b s i i t latter  rmulation, e  must  choose  a  measure  of esource  tilization. fo on r u Traditionally,  as  been  the nemployment rate,  ut  it  s ar rom  clear  hat it h u b i f f w really  orks  best. w

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President rry. Pa

MR. PARRY. Mike,  I  have  a  question  bout he CI forecast.    understand  our a t E I y point bout he  fourth  uarter  f  last  ear. f  e look  at he rend f he CI in  your a t q o y I w t t o t E forecast  rom  the  second uarter  f ast  ear o  the irst arter  f  1999,  it  eems  unlikely f q o l y t f qu o s to  me that  e are oing  to ontinue  o xperience  uch  a  favorable  rend. irst,   eems w g c t e s t F its

to  me that  ncreases  n  medical osts  re  likely  e  accelerating,   if  hat  ccurs our i i c a tob and t o y forecast  ould  imply  slower ncreases  n  the age and  salary  omponent of he CI. w i i w c t E Secondly,    think hat  onuses  and  commissions,  hich  clearly ayed   major  role  n I t b w pl a i boosting  he  ECI  in  the ourth  uarter  f ast  ear,  ay continue  o lay uch  a  role n  the t f q o l y m t p s i current  uarter  nd  maybe beyond.  That  seems  likely r eal state mmissions  in q a fo r e co particular.  o  not  know how the  BLS  handles he easonal  djustment  f onuses, I  d t s a o b which  sometimes  are aid t  the eginning f he  year or ax easons  s  opposed  to  the p a b o t f t r a end  of he  year.   also hink hat  nflation  pectations uld e  a  major  factor, t ow t I t t i ex co b bu h those re  actually rmulated  ay be  more  complex  because  we anticipate  provement a fo m im in  the ore  CPI  due  to echnical ctors.  o  the xtent  hat  eople re ooking t hat  is c t fa T e t p a l a w happening  to  actual  rices, ose actors  ay not e  seen.  So,  I  guess   end  up  thinking p th f m b I that  his  s ne  area here  I  have  the reatest certainty. t i o w g un

MR.  PRELL.  I  don't  now if  t  s he rea n  which  we have  our  greatest k i i t a i uncertainty,  t  I  would  certainly  ree here s ncertainty tending  his  art  f he bu ag t i u at t p o t forecast.  robably s nwise  to  put oo  much weight  on  the uarterly ogression Itp i u t q pr of these ompensation umbers. We  have  found  them to  be  extremely rratic d  the c n e an seasonal  djustment  f his  eries  s ncertain.    think  he est  ay to  look  at hese a o t s i u I t b w t numbers  is n some moving average asis. e  took  a  look  at hem on  a  four-quarter o b W t change  basis,  nd  we saw an  acceleration  er he ast our uarters,  t t  as only n a ov t p f q bu i w o the  order f  about /4  ercentage  oint. hat  included  he ffects   a  considerable ost o 1 p p T t e of bo to  the ourth  uarter  rom  commissions  and  bonuses. he surge n  the atter  s f q f T i l wa associated th  the  high  level  f ctivity    the eal state  nd  mortgage  banking usiness, wi o a in r e a b and  it  oes  not ecessarily  ply  ongoing  rapid  rowth  from  that  igh  level.  e  also ad d n im g h W h

a  minimum  wage increase  hat  robably ffected  he ourth  uarter  o  some extent  n  a t p a t f q t o lagged  basis.  ut  when we look t  the CI components  by  industry  nd  so  on,  there  s o B a E a i n broad, cross-the-board  celeration  at  ne  can  observe.  So,  I  think  t s easonable  o a ac th o i i r t take hose ecent  umbers  with  a  grain f  salt.  hey are  affected  n  important  xtent t r n o T toa e by  the inance,  nsurance, d  real state  ectors, d  they ay also e  capturing  ome of f i an e s an m b s what  we have  been  hearing  bout  temp  workers nd  computer  people. hen  we get a a W beyond  that,  do  not  see  much going  on. we

In  the irst arter, s, e expect nother lug f onuses.  That  is  apparently f qu ye w a s o b when the  majority  f he all  Street  irms ill e  paying hem  out, o  we have  them  in o t W f w b t s our  numbers.  That  tends o eep  the irst-quarter  efits mber from  dropping ack  as t k f ben nu b it  ight  otherwise,  iven he  fourth-quarter ge.  The really g  issue oing orward, m g t bul bi g f I think,  s he nflation  pectations ory.  ow, there re  different  ys that  eople odel i t i ex st N a wa p m the omentum  in  compensation.  Some look t  wages  as  the  momentum m a variable.  f  e I w did  that,  would  forecast   acceleration.  pending  on  which  compensation ariable we an De v is elected,   ould e  a  slight celeration    one  that  s onsiderable. s itc b ac or i c

An alternative  ew  is o  look t rice xpectations,  d  we have  models  that  o vi t a p e an d that.  t s ot  clear  hich model  works  best,  ut he nes  that  ncorporate ice I i n w b t o i pr expectations e  predicting  ch slower  inflation    compensation han  we have  written ar mu in t down.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. How  significant   he  correlation  tween  nominal ist be compensation nd  productivity? a

MR. PRELL.  I  don't  now the nswer  to  that  uestion, t  I  suspect  he k a q bu t correlation   ery  weak in he  short  un.  In  fact,  e get ome of ur  largest isv t r w s o compensation ncreases en productivity  creases  re  beginning  o  fall  ear he nd  of i wh in a t n t e a  cyclical pansion. ut  I  would  not  venture   further atement  n  that. ex B a st o

MR.  STOCKTON. One can  put onfarm  business  roductivity  to    wage n p in a equation  nd  actually e  whether  or  not roductivity   n  important  actor  xplaining a se p isa f e nominal  wage gains.  The statistical  ect  urns ut  to e  marginally  ignificant   est. eff t o b s atb We  know that  eal age aspirations,  osely  ased  on  productivity, ht  to  be  an r w lo b oug important  actor  n  conditioning  ge demands,  but usinesses  ay not  be  willing  o f i wa b m t grant he  wage increases.  o the  extent  hat  luctuations  productivity    not  show up t T t f in do in  wages,  the irst  und  effects ll how through o rofit rgins  rather  han ominal f ro wi s t p ma t n compensation.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The reason   raise  he uestion  s ctually e I t q i a th reverse;  t  elates   anecdotal  ndications  at  hen nominal  wages are eginning o i r to i th w b t accelerate,  en usiness  scalates s  fforts  educe  costs  nd  improve  productivity. th b e it e tor a So,  if  hat  odel  were  functioning   a  meaningful ense,  hen   significant  se  n t m in s t a ri i nominal  wages  could  very  well erely eflect  e act  hat  roductivity  s rising d m r th f t p wa an

therefore  nit  abor  osts  ere  not.  But  when you  try o ut  that  nto  he quation, u u l c w t p i t e yo are  telling  that  ou are icking p  almost othing. me y p u n

MR. PRELL.  Some  of  this  as  been  touched n in  the  simulations   the ffects h o of e of  a  productivity  rprise at  e have  discussed  n  the  past  nd  how it  ight  feed su th w i a m through  to ages,  profits,  d  prices  n  a  short-run namic.  One of he hings  hat w an i dy t t t presumably  happened  in  the ourth  uarter  s hat  eople orking  in  mortgage  banking f q i t p w firms nd  in  some other inance  nd  real state  reas robably ere  more productive, d a f a e a p w an they  got  larger  ommissions.  So,  there  as a  direct  ink  etween  compensation nd c w l b a production.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  inehan. M

MS. MINEHAN. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. Mike,  I  think  ou  mentioned efore y b that  he reenbook  forecast   at  the ow  end  of  a  lot  f  outside  orecasts,  cluding e t G is l o f in th low end  of he  Blue  Chip  range  in  particular.  u also entioned hat  t  as a  little t Yo m t i w lower  than ost  of ur  forecasts re.  Obviously,  he  two  things  hat  re riving  our m o he t t a d y forecast  re et xports nd  the  swing  in  inventories.  s I  look  at ther orecasts, a n e a A o f particularly  the xport ide,  ou seem to  be  an  outlier   terms  of he rowth  in on e s y in t g exports. ave you  done  any  testing   see hat  the ffect  n your  overall recast uld H to w e o fo wo be  if, stead  f  a  growth  rate f .6 ercent  n xports,  ou  assumed  a  higher  ate,  ay, , in o o 0 p i e y r s 1 2,  or   percent? 3

MS. JOHNSON. I  don't  ave  a  precise  umerical nswer  to  that  uestion.  f  e h n a q I w were  to enerate igher  xport rowth  in  our  model  by  exogenously tronger  ncome g h e g s i growth  abroad,  hen  we would  go  through   process  nvolving  ertain  nteractions se t a i c i who result  ould  be  to roduce  a  net ositive pact n U.S.  GDP. w p p im o

MR.  TRUMAN. The effect  n  GDP  would  be  0.2 ercentage  oint,  think. o p p I

MS.  MINEHAN. A couple  of enths? t

MR.  TRUMAN. Yes. Exports re  10 percent  f  GDP.  When  they row 2 a o g percent  aster, hink  he  answer  would  be  0.2 ercent, ughly. f I  t t p ro

MS. JOHNSON. That  implies    multiplier    1. a of

MR.  PRELL.  The multiplier  ght  be as  high  as  112. mi

MS. JOHNSON. Yes,  1 o t 1-1/2 is  usually  hat  we use  as  a  rule  f humb in  our w o t calculations.

MS. MINEHAN. What are  the nderlying  easons or our  forecast   exports u r f y of being s  low as  it  s n omparison  to  other  orecasts?  guess t's t mportant  hat a i i c f I i no i w other eople  think  n  some sense,  ut ou  must  have  a  lower orecast r oreign  DP. p i b y f fo f G

MS. JOHNSON. To a  degree. he  swing  in  exports  n  our  forecast,    our T i as models  depict  t, es to he  relative ice  erm  more than o  what  we are  saying bout i ow t pr t t a the  slowdown in  the rowth  in  foreign  DP. g G

MS. MINEHAN. So,  that  as  more to o  with he ppreciation  he ollar? h d t a oft d MS. JOHNSON. Yes.  Forecasters  vary  in  terms f he  speed  and  strength do o t of the  reaction  hanges  in  exchange  rates  hat  hey ut  into  heir  odels.  I  don't  hink  e toc t t p t m t w really  re  an  outlier   terms  of he ature  f ur odel being adically fferent  om a in t n o o m r di fr other  odels.  Our forecasts e  comparatively    little  ak on  some countries,  t m ar a we bu I do not  think e are  radically  fferent.    do  systematically  ke elative ice  ffects to w di We ta r pr e in account,  nd  I  think  e see hem  as  quite  lastic   the xport ide. hrough  both  1998 a w t e on e s T and 1999,  the xchange  rate  as  a  significant ect  n  slowing xports. e h eff i e

The other  issing iece s he  decision  n our  part  o  utilize orecasting  rategy m p i t o t a  f st that  e have  wrestled  ith  since he  middle f  the ear. hat  relates   how  we evaluate w w t o y T to the  very apid  rowth  of  exports  hat  ccurred  n  the irst lf  f  1997 and  how to r g t o i f ha o incorporate at  evelopment  looking orward. e  have  taken  a  middle  course. bout th d f W A two  Greenbooks  ago, e indicated  change  in  our  strategy,    it  ere, n he  sense hat  n w a as w i t t i forecasting owth  rates,  were going  to  be  guided y  the undamentals.  e  were  not gr we b f W going  to  assume  that  ecause he rowth  of  exports  ad  exceeded ur  forecasts r he b t g h o fo t first lf f  1997,  we should xtrapolate  at  orward.  This trategy s adopted artly ha o e th f s wa p because  we concluded hat  e did ot  understand  ome of he  elements hat  ad  driven t w n s t t h the  high  numbers  in  the irst lf  f  1997. In  addition,  had  tested  ur odel  in  as f ha o we o m many different ys as  we could,  nd  we thought hat  n  average  it  as robust  nd wa a t o w a therefore  hat  e should e  guided y  it.  o,  we have  not  added, f  ou will,  n t w b b S i y a unexplained  actor  o  the  growth  rate  n  1998 and 1999. That auses   very apid f t i c a r deceleration    our orecast.  e  should ee  it oon  and  we should now soon  whether r in f W s s k o not  this  as  the ight  trategy  ake ith espect  o  forecasting  port  rowth. w r s tot w r t ex g

The data hat  e have, articularly   data e just  ot  for he ourth uarter,  d t w p the w g t f q ha slightly  gher xports  n  them  than  we had  written  own in he reenbook  but  not y hi e i d t G b much or  enough  to ake us  think hat  his  trategy   not  assuming  an additional m t t s of unexplained  lement o  export rowth  was the  wrong  thing  o  do. I  think  e felt e t g t w supported  y the eigebook  stories at  e have  been  hearing,  the urchasing b B th w by p managers'  data hat  ere  released  oday,  nd  by  the nformation  btained  hrough he t w t a i o t t extra  alls  bout he ffects  f sian  developments hat  e made with  the elp  of  our c a t e o A t w h Reserve  Bank colleagues.  here  are  responses  rom  members of he rivate  ector T f t p s

suggesting  hat here  s  some evidence o  date, long ith  increasing certainty  d t t i t a w un an concern,  hat  xport rowth  is,  n  fact,  oing o  slow  dramatically. t e g i g t

MS. MINEHAN. I  do  not oubt  that  t  s oing o low. Dropping  off  he  cliff d i i g t s t is the  question.  he other  rea f ncertainty at  s  actually re  important  n  thinking T a o u th i mo i about he  slowing ate  f  GDP  growth  is nventories. t r o i

MS. MINEHAN. Okay,  but iven  the hange  in  the ate  f hange, on't g c r o c d inventories  d  up  being ore important? en m

MR. PRELL.  Setting  side he  very  fine oints  f  the ffects   seasonal a t p o e of adjustments, t  exports  re he  bigger  rag  in  the  first w  quarters  f his  ear. here  is ne a t d fe o t y T a  dynamic  here hat    alluded  o ery  briefly.  think  ou  are  right.  s I ave  looked t t I t v I y A h a other orecasts  nd  tried  o  figure  ut he rithmetic  have  seen, ur  consumption orecast f a t o t a I o f looks  relatively  rong  ompared  to  many of  the utside  orecasts. st c o f

MR.  PRELL.

For  Europe, unning y eye  down the  column of  estimates, ould  say  the r m I  w number tends o  be  about  /2 percentage  oint f  GDP.  We  have  estimated  n  elasticity t 1 p o a of one  for ur  export  emand from  these conomies.

He gets umbers  that  re  of he ame order f  magnitude. he tow n a t s o T one  difference s that  e  was assuming  the ffects  n  Japan  would  all  e  offset   some wa h e o b by combination f  exchange  rate  hanges  and  other  evelopments;  recisely at  he  had  in o c d p wh mind was difficult    appraise  ecause verything  epends  on  one's  tarting int  n to b e d s po i September.

Ours  is robably    little her han hat, t r p a hig t t bu it s ell  within he  same ballpark. owever,  his nalysis  roduced  a  surprising  mber i w t H a p nu for he uropeans  at  the able.  oth  the rench  and  Germans said t  as a  much bigger t E t B F i w number than  they ere  thinking  bout  and  that  s oing  to  mark  things  own. w a i g d

One point  hat  t eems  to  me is ery  misleading  rom  an  analytical  andpoint t i s v f st is that he uropeans  always  look t heir  rowth  rates  n a  year-over-year  sis.  o, t E a t g o ba S year-over-year  owth  in urope  may be  the ame  in  1998  as  in  1997 because 997  was a gr E s 1 good  year,  icking  p  toward  the ear-end.  ut  if  e look  at ourth  uarter  ver ourth p u y B w f q o f quarter,  get  something ike    half  ercent  arkdown  and  that  s ssentially  alf we l a p m i e theh percent  hat  aren  was talking  bout ecause e used  to  have  the  same growth  rate  n t K a b w i 1998 as  we had  in  1997.

Our  view  was that  o  some degree he ise as warranted  ecause  in  the  spring 1 t t r w b of  1995 the ollar  as  exceptionally  ak,  and  there  ere  good  reasons or t o ise. d w we w f i t r I have  not one  this  xercise  nd  I annot uote umbers to  you, ut  one  can  look ack  at d e a c q n b b the  forecast  s  it as presented    year  ago  today. ndeed n  a  briefing at  as  delivered a w a I i th w yesterday,  copy  of  which  I  believe  ou  have  received, aff   Research nd  Statistics a y st in a did  precisely at.  n  January 997 we were  not  expecting  he ollar  o  continue  o th I 1 t d t t appreciate e ay that  t  as, nd  we were  not  expecting  he .S.  economy to  be  as th w i h a t U relatively  rong s  it  as  been.  So,  most  of he ppreciation  at  ou  can  see  in hart  3 st a h t a th y C

More broadly, t i ar r w t i n real isposable  ncome  rose t n  annual  rate  f  almost  percent  n he  fourth  uarter. d i a a o 5 i t q Debt service  urdens  are igh  but hey re  manageable.  In  this  ituation,  s ot b h t a s it i n surprising at  onsumer  sentiment,  both  the ichigan  and  the  Conference oard th c on M B measures,  s  at   very igh  level.  onsumer spending,  t  eems  to  me,  may remain  quite i a h C i s strong  his  ear ot nly  in he irst lf,  s  is eing rojected   the reenbook, ut n t y n o t f ha a b p by G b i the  second alf  s  well. f  t oes  and  if  inancial nditions main  favorable, siness h a I i d f co re bu investment  nd housing ctivity  e  likely  o emain  robust  s  well. a a ar t r a

Despite ll his, e  Greenbook  is rojecting at  ominal  GDP  growth  is oing  to a t th p th n g decline  y  about - / b 2 1 2 ercentage  oints, om  close o  6  percent  n  1997 to  3-1/2  percent  n p p fr t i i 1998.

Even  if  t  oes, he reenbook  is till  ojecting at  he ore  CPI  rate  ill o i d t G s pr th t c w

In  short  rom  my standpoint,  ile he  Greenbook  projection  ertainly f wh t isc plausible,  s  ealization  pends  on a  lot  f evelopments hat  ay or  may not  occur. it r de o d t m I recognize,  f ourse,  hat  sian  developments ould  turn ut  to e  worse  than  expected. o c t A c o b But  it  eems  to  me that  he triking bound,  specially   ecent  ays, n  most  Asian s t s re e inr d i stock  arkets  suggests  hat  ith  the ossible  xception  f ndonesia, is  risis  eing m t w p e o I th c isb contained  t east  or  ow.

In  the esidential  ea,  s  some others  ave  reported, strict  ilders  ell  e that r ar a h Di bu t m the  demand for ew housing s ery  strong.  s an  example  of  that,  uper owl Sunday is n i v A S B usually   very  slow  day  for howing  real state, t his  ear  the loor  raffic  s heavy a s e bu t y f t wa and  sales  ere  quite  trong.  he price  ncreases r ew homes appear o  be  holding, w s T i fo n t although rices  or xisting mes remain  flat.  here  seems to  be  a  real  hange  in  tastes. p f e ho T c If   seller s  a  regular  ized  edroom and  a  regular zed ath,  he  house ill ot ove. a ha s b si b t w n m Buyers  want  bathrooms  as  big s  traditional rooms. a bed

We  are  hearing  eports  rom  some manufacturers  ho export  o  Asia  that  ome r f w t s orders re  being ancelled  nd  others  ostponed. he  Asian  problem  is lso ffecting a c a p T a a agriculture.  ultry  s   big ndustry  n he hird istrict, ticularly  Delaware  and Po i a i i t T D par in the  south entral  art f ennsylvania.  ith  the ird lu care n  Asia  and  the trong c p o P W b f s i s dollar, ere  s  a  slowing emand for oultry  xports  o  Asia.  As a  result,  is  oultry  s th i d p e t th p i being  sold n  the omestic arket  and  chicken rices  re oming  down. o d m p a c

Turning  to he  nation,  think here  re hree ey  uncertainties t  e need  to  deal t I t a t k tha w with.  The  first  hat  he  national ta how a  very  powerful conomy in  1997  coming ist t da s e into 998,  fueled  argely  y strong  onsumption  and  investment  rowth.  Our evaluation 1 l b c g of  the necdotal  nformation  oints  o  some slowing n  demand stemming  from  the allout a i p t i f from  the  Asian  situation.  t  how much of  a  damping  effect  s ncertain, though   see Bu i u al I more growth  than  the reenbook. G

The second  uncertainty  hat  he isinflation cess as  had  surprising aying ist t d pro h st power.  Wage  gains ontinue  o  be  offset   productivity  ins,  o  inflation   alling c t by ga s isf while  corporate  rofits main  high.  How  much more staying  ower  this  isinflation p re p d process as  is lso ncertain,  though   suspect  t  as  a  while  to  run.  If  usinesses nnot h a u al I i h b ca get  more volume out  of xisting sources, ey ndertake  dditional unds  of e re th u a ro downsizing.

The third  ncertainty,  ich  is ore  for iscussion morrow so  I  will  ouch  on  it u wh m d to t only  briefly,   hat  onetary  policy  s oughly eutral, t  it  ay be  tightening  plicitly ist m i r n bu m im with  the ominal  fed unds  rate  eld onstant  nd  inflationary ectations lling. n f h c a exp fa However,  the oney supply as  been  growing  faster tely. m h la

What should e make of  these ncertainties  the  national  conomy?  I  think e w u in e w need  a  wide  peripheral sion  ecause   don't  hink  e know where  the eal  anger s vi b I t w r d i going  to ome from. c

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President ynn. Gu

MR.  GUYNN. Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman. Over  the ast ear,  he erformance f p y t p o the  Sixth istrict  onomy generally  as  paralleled  at  f he ation,  nd  with  few D ec h th o t n a exceptions  hat  ontinues  o  be  the icture at  e see. oday,  rather  han un  through t c t p th w T t r a detailed  ommentary  sector  y  sector,  thought    would concentrate  remarks  on  a  few c b I I my important  ifferences d  concerns hat   ave  begun  to  note. d an t Ih

First, e  Asian  situation  s  had  only   marginal mpact n  our  District    far. th ha a i o so Shipments  to  Asia  have  moderated,  specially ipments f ertilizer, ,  aper,  nd e sh o f pulp p a citrus.   large  hemical ompany in  our  region xperienced  ome cancellations A c c e s of shipments o  Asia  but eportedly s relieved cause  it  as unable o  meet  those t r wa be w t

shipments nyway due  to  a  lack f vailable il  ars. eople n  our  aerospace  nd a o a ra c P i a defense ndustries  so ave  begun  to  express oncerns bout otential  clines  n  orders i al h c a p de i from  the sian  part f he  world.  At  the ame time,  ome interesting mmetries re A o t s s asy a appearing.  ne shipper  eported  ecently at  is irm  had  added  capacity  n  anticipation O r r th h f i of  increased  rade  ith  Latin merica, ut he irm  had  to  divert  hat  apacity  o  meet  its t w A b t f t c t customers'  emand for ore shipping  o  bring mports rom  Asia  to he  United tates. d m t i f t S Finally,  ing  business  n  Asia  is learly re  difficult  r istrict  rms. he  owner  of do i c mo fo D fi T an  upscale etail nglass  hain ith  over ,000  outlets,  cluding  9  in  Asia,  eports  hat r su c w 2 in 1 r t his sian  sales  re ff ome 70 to  80  percent.  he bottom  line  or he istrict   hat  he A a o s T f t D ist t overall  ffects om  Asia  have  been  minimal  so  far,  ith eclines  n  our egion's ports e fr w d i r ex to  Asia itigated  y  stable  rowth  of  exports  o atin merica. m b g t L A

Second,  after  heir  ecent  ecline, ices  f il nd  natural  as  are ow t r d pr o o a g n approaching heir  istoric  eak-even evels  hat  n he ast ould  have  caused omestic t h br l t i t p w d drilling  d  extraction   begin  to  shut own. However,  we see  no  evidence f hat an to d o t pattern  his  ime  around,  nd  in act  he ig ount emains  at ery igh  levels.  he  new t t a f t r c r v h T drilling  chnologies at    talked  bout n  past eetings ave  truly  rought reak-even te th I a i m h b b prices  o  much lower  levels.  ence,  we don't  xpect o  see  the lowing n  that  ector  hat t H e t s i s t we would  have  in  past ycles. c

Third,  eal  state  ctivity, ecially sidential,  ore mixed  in  our  region han r e a esp re is m t appears o  be  the ase ationwide.  Commercial construction   trong,  specially t c n iss e in grocery nd  class   office  pace,  nd  this  hould alance he eakness  we are  seeing  n a A s a s b t w i residential  nstruction.  e cautionary  ote,  owever,  is hat    am starting   et co On n h t I tog

numerous expressions  f oncern  that  ockets f  excessively eculative mmercial o c p o sp co construction  e  emerging, otably  n  the orth tlanta  arket. ar n i n A m

Fourth,  e are  getting  ixed  signals  rom  lenders.  onsistent th  the  loan w m f C wi officers'  rvey,  redit  till ems  to  be  available d  competition  s ierce.  hen  lenders su c s se an i f W are  asked  whether redit  tandards  re lipping,  e esponse  s enerally ,  but  lenders c s a s th r i g no then o on  to  say  that  ecause f ompetition  hey re  apt o  grant oans t ower  rates g b o c t a t l a l than  in he ast. his  seeming  disconnect  etween  their rception  f he  links  etween t p T b pe o t b credit  tandards  nd  pricing  or isk  s omething e should  e  concerned bout. s a f r i s w b a

Fifth, th  respect  o ages and  prices, ke veryone lse e continue  o  get wi t w li e e w t reports  f abor hortages, d  firms re ither  oing  to  great  engths  o ire ualified o l s an a e g l t h q workers  or  they re urtailing  oduction.  or  example, hipbuilders    New  Orleans re a c pr F s in a resorting  iring  orkers  from  overseas  o  fill e eed  for elders,  hipfitters, toh w t th n w s and other  orkers.  One national  rucking  xecutive  eported  dling  0 percent  f  his w t e r i 1 o equipment  because e  has  not  been  able o ind ualified ivers.  espite  uch  problems, h t f q dr D s however,  wage increases  n  our egion ppear o  have  been  held o  moderate evels, d i r a t t l an this  lso ppears o  be  the ase  with rices.  n  our ost  recent  anufacturing  urvey,  he a a t c p I m m s t portion  f irms eporting at  hey re  paying  higher  rices  or aterials creased,  s o f r th t a p f m de a did  the roportion  f irms ndicating  at  hey eceived  igher  rices  or inished ods. p o f i th t r h p f f go

At  the ational  evel,  see  an  economy that  ontinues  o hum along" ith  few, n l we c t " w if  ny, f  the igns f lowing hat  any of  us  have  been  forecasting  r everal  eetings a o s o s t m fo s m now.  However,  as  others  ave  observed,    do  not elieve  hat  e have  yet een uch of h I b t w s m the  slowing ffects  rom  the sian  problems  and  what  they old or  he  United tates.  f e f A h f t S O course,  he hreshold  uestion  s ow great  he  negative  mpact ventually ll e.  It oes t t q i h t i e wi b d

seem  clear  hat  he  Asian  shock ill orestall  e eed  for ny  policy  ightening ve in t t w f th n a t mo the  short  un.  Clearly, e conomy will  ot  continue  o  get he oost o  GDP  from  net r th e n t t b t exports hat he ecently  eleased  eport  uggests  e got n  the ourth  uarter. t t r r r s w i f q

Stepping  ack, t  oes  seem  to e that  he isks  o ny  forecast ve  changed  in b i d m t r t a ha two  respects  ince ur  last  eeting.  They  have  gotten  ore symmetric  and  they ave s o m m h gotten  reater.   uess ne  could ay  the istribution isks  ow has  fatter ils an t g Ig o s d f  r n ta th i did  the ast  ime  we were  together. r  me,  the ild ards ontinue  o  be  related  sia, l t Fo w c c t toA the  consumer, nd  investment  pending. hile  one  certainly  n  argue hat  ll  hese a s W ca t a t sectors  ill low  in oming quarters,  ere s lso   significant  obability  at  ll  ay not w s c th i a a pr th a m slow.  For  example, t  sn't  fficult  anticipate  at  he ncreased  isposable come i i di to th t i d in that  ouseholds  ay generate  y  refinancing eir  ortgages o  take dvantage f ower h m b th m t a o l interest  tes  ill timulate  nd  help aintain onsumer  spending. imilarly,  e  reports ra w s a m c S th we get re  that  uch of  the ecent  urge n  investment  pending s otivated  y  the esire a m r s i s i m b d of  U.S.  businesses   cut osts o  as  to aintain rofit rgins  in  the ace f ompetition to c s m p ma f o c from  lower  import rices.  learly, is  ownward pressure  n  prices  ill  ontinue  s  a p C th d o w c a result  f he sian  crisis,  d  this  ould elp aintain nvestment  pending t  higher o t A an c h m i s a levels  han  would  otherwise  e  expected. t b

Finally,  ourse,  s  others  ave  suggested, e mpact  from  Asia  may prove  to e ofc a h th i b either  ubstantially e severe r  substantially s evere han  our  most  likely  cenario s mor o les s t s indicates.  balance,  s  I  hope my comments have  suggested,    think  e continue  o e On a I w t b in  a  period f ery atisfactory nomic  performance,  ut ne  where  the ange f o v s eco b o r o potential tcomes  is ven  wider  and  more uncertain  han  when we last  et.  While  the ou e t m Asian  shock  and  its  allout  y give s  significant  owing n  the conomy's  expansion f ma u sl i e

and  a  further spite om  price ressures, hink  t s qually  ikely at e may find re fr p I  t i i e l th w ourselves  y  late  all  r  early  inter f his  ear ith  almost he  same set f olicy b f o w o t y w t o p questions  hat  e faced n  November and  December of  last  ear. ntil e see  the sian t w i y U w A effects  lay ut,    would  say  again hat    hope  we can  allow urselves  o  enjoy he p o I t I o t t moment  and  use  this  eriod  f  time o alk  ut ur  long-term  olicy  references.  e p o t t o o p p W should  continue  o ake the oint  hat  ow inflation   lso ro-growth nd t m p t l isa p a pro-employment,  nd  that  s  something hat  ot  only entral  ankers  should et xcited a i t n c b g e about.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.

The Seventh  District  onomy ec continues  o xpand  at   moderate  pace  with  only  a  few  reports us ar hat  sian t e a th f t A developments  have  had  any  measurable mpact.

In  terms f he sian  situation,  e mpact  on  most  Seventh  District  dustries o t A th i in is still  re speculation an  reality. to and  steel  ompanies  are orried bout ossible mo th Au c w a p increases  n  imports rom  Korea  and  Japan, lthough  hat  oesn't  eem  to ave  happened i f a t d s h yet.

For  most  businesses   the eventh istrict,  e ajor  problem  continues  o e in S D th m t b hiring  nd  retaining mpetent orkers.  In  other ords, abor  arkets re  still ry  tight. a co w w l m a ve Help-wanted  advertising creased  n  all ur  major etropolitan eas ver he  last  hree in i o m ar o t t months  of  1997 and  that  s n  contrast   the ational  ndex, hich  in ecember was i i to n i w D lower  than n  September.  The  latest rvey y  Manpower  Incorporated dicates at i su b in th hiring  lans ationally r he  second  quarter  f  1998 are  up  somewhat from  the irst p n fo t o f quarter  nd  about he  same as  for he ery  strong  econd  quarter   1997.

Turning  to he ational  utlook,    think  he isks  re  somewhat  more balanced t n o I t r a today  than hey  seemed  to  be  in ecember. The level  f eal DP  currently pears o e t D o r G ap t b above  potential. bor  markets  are he ightest    a  generation  nd  yet here  s till La t t in a t i s no hard  evidence f  accelerating  flation.  oking  ahead, he ey  issues  re sia, o in Lo t k a A inventories,  d, f  course,  nflation.  nsidering  he omposition f ourth-quarter an o i Co t c o f growth, ur  view  is hat  rowth  this  ear ill  low  to ts  rend  ate  ue  to izable  rags o t g y w s i t r d s d coming  from  declines  n  net xports  nd  inventory  nvestment.  s we discussed  arlier, i e a i A e the  biggest  ources f ncertainty e he sian  situation d  the ossible  nventory s o u ar t A an p i correction.  ur outlook s bout  as  pessimistic    the reenbook  regarding  sia  and O i a as G A slightly  ss o  on  the utlook or n  inventory  orrection. spite his  nticipated le s o f a c De t a slowing  of  GDP  growth, e expect abor  arkets o emain  tight.  ithout  mitigating w l m t r W factors  uch  as  recent  xchange  rate ovements and  heightened  ompetition  rom  imports s e m c f along  with  energy rice  eclines,  would  be  concerned hat  PI  inflation  s poised  o p d we t C wa t increase.

For  example, BP,  which  is   large  rocessor  f eef nd  pork,  as  seen  a  50 I a p o b a h percent  rop  in  its  nternational es,  ith  Asia  especially ntributing    that.  lso, d i sal w co to A Japanese ustomers re  negotiating ry  hard  for etter  eals o  circumvent he  effects c a ve b d t t of the  stronger  ollar.  ome firms e have  talked  o,  s  I  think ob McTeer mentioned as d S w t a B w happening  in is istrict,  e aving   little  ouble  ecause  a  number  of heir ian h D ar h a tr b t As customers annot btain etters   credit, d  that  as  hurt he xports  f hose irms o c o l of an h t e o t f t that  art  f he  world. p o t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Phillips.

MS. PHILLIPS.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  The year  1997  turned ut o  be  a o t very  good  year,  o matter  ow we look  at  it.  utput  expanded.  The  U.S. obs achine n h O j m was alive  nd  well.  Salaries d  wages recorded eal rowth.  A balanced  ederal  udget a an r g f b came into n  sight.  verall nflation  s relatively l  contained;  oods  inflation i O i wa wel g appeared o e  about  nonexistent,  t  inflation    the ervice  ndustries  d ersist t b bu in s i di p at about  3  percent.    don't  hink  he  1997 growth  rate  s ustainable  d  strains e tarting I t t i s an ar s to  show. Some  of he  reports  round he  table  oday ave  provided xamples  of abor t a t t h e l shortages  hat  ow  appear o e  hampering  some kinds f  investment  ctivity.  creases t n t b o a In in  labor  osts  how signs f dging igher  t east  n  some areas.  Although  increases c s o e h a l i in compensation osts  ave  been  offset  y  increases   productivity,    s uestionable    to c h b in it i q as how long  that  rocess an  continue. ince he .S.  economy is  service-oriented    costs p c S t U and are  under ressure  n  that  ector,   s ard o  believe  hat  ggregate  nflation  ll e  held p i s iti h t t a i wi b

at ay  forever, t  the  indicators  e etter  t  least  or he  near erm, articularly  the b bu ar b a f t t p on goods  front.

While the .S.  economy is  strong, ia  remains he  big nknown. Had the sian U As t u A situation t  occurred,  ffectively  ducing  he utlook or xpansion n  the nited  States no e re t o f e i U and  indeed erhaps orld  growth,   think omething lse  ould  have  happened  to  slow p w I s e w things  own.  We  could ave  had  a  stock arket  correction. flation  uld ave  heated d h m In co h up.  Demand, particularly he  labor arkets,  ould ave  outstripped  pply,  nd  we in  t m c h su a could  have  seen  more  of  an  increase   salaries d  wages.  More likely,  eemptive in an pr monetary  policy  ould  have  been  necessary.  t eems  to e that  he sian  crisis w I s m t A is simply  the rigger r he  emergence  of   slowdown that  as bound  to appen. t fo t a w h

That  leads o  the ext  question, w much of   slowdown will e get?  I  find t n ho a w myself ore optimistic  an  the  staff   that    anticipate ore sustainable  owth  rate  f m th in I a  m gr o 2-1/4  to -/2 ercent or 998.  The  fundamentals  hat  ade 1997 so  strong  ave  not one 2 p f 1 t m h g away: a  strong abor  arket  and  a  good  climate  or ontinued  nvestment--adequate h l m f c i cas flow, rofits at eem to  be  holding p at east  or ow,  reasonably  ow-cost  apital,  d p th s u l f n l c an strong  alance heets.  onsumer spending hould lso old  up  as  long  as  employment is b s C s a h sustained,  d  if  he ortgage  refinancing om continues, nsumer  spending hould an t m bo co s support  conomic  growth  in  1998,  or t east  here houldn't    much of   slowdown in e a l t s be a the  growth  of onsumer  spending.   admit hat  sia  is ikely  o e  a  decelerating  ctor, c I t A l t b fa but  even  Asia  creates  ome crosscurrents  r .S.  economic  growth. s fo U

In  sum,  there  learly e  risks  nd  they ay have  increased.  ut  unless  he tock c ar a m B t s market  declines  ore  than he  staff sumes  or  unless  he sian  situation  oduces ore m t as t A pr m unanticipated  rprises,  e  expansion hould low  to  a  more moderate  growth  path n su th s s i

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. We will ow turn o  a  discussion  f he  long-run n t o t ranges or he  monetary  aggregates, d  I  will  all  n  Dave Lindsey. f t an c o

MR.  LINDSEY. The Committee  was given  some colorful arts  esterday, ch y but  today   will e  referring   he olorless arts  ntitled,  aterial  or taff I b tot c ch e "M f S Presentation    Long-Run Ranges."  3/ on

The first  ge  of our  handout eproduces  he  table  n  page  11 of he luebook pa y r t o t B except or   revision  o he  M2  and  M3  growth  rates  or 997 in he irst lumn. f a t t f 1 t f co The receipt  f ew data rom  the nvestment  ompany  Institute  the RA o n f I C on I component of  retail ney market  mutual  funds  in  the  second  and  third  uarters mo q of  last  ear as  caused s  to evise  pward  the nnual rowth  rates  or 2  and  M3 y h u r u a g f M by  0.3  percentage  oint  ach.  Thus, he evisions ace 2  growth  somewhat p e t r pl M above  the  percent  pper  bound  of ts  ange or ast  ear nd  M3  growth  even 5 u i r f l y a further  bove  its    percent  pper ound. a 6 u b

The second  column  shows  staff  orecasts r oney,  credit, d  nominal  GDP f fo m an this  ear. ominal GDP  and  M2  are  both xpected o  grow at nnual ates  f  -1/2 y N e t a r o 3 percent,  hich  represents ite    slowdown for oth  measures.  The Committee's w qu a b own central  endency or ominal  GDP  has  a  midpoint   bit  bove  4  percent, t f n a a implying  a  somewhat faster te f 2  growth  than  the taff resees  his  ear, a o M s o t y assuming  flat  2. The  lower  panel f he ext hart,  lso evised  rom  the V o t n c a r f Bluebook, uts he  implied  rediction    flat  2 over  1998  in  the erspective p t p ofa V p of the xperience f ecent  ears. espite  he ptrend f  V2 from  mid-1994  to e o r y D t u o mid-1997,  we expect he  pattern  f  little  locity ange  that  eld ate  ast  ear o t o ve ch h l l y t persist rough his ear. he steady unds  rate  ssumed  in he  Greenbook th t y T f a t forecast  mplies hat  he pportunity st f  M2  will hange  little.    also i t t o co o c We believe  hat  he ogginess  f tock rices  n  the taff recast  ill  ivert  ome t t s o s p i s o w d s inflows  rom  stock utual  funds o 2  assets, th  their  table  rincipal,  ereby f m t M wi s p th short-circuiting    renewed  updrift   V2. With that  utcome, he  behavior  f any in o t o V2 this  ear  would  parallel  s erformance uring he  three  ecades rior  o  the y it p d t d p t 1990s  shown by  the ots urrounding  he egression ne  n  the pper  panel f his d s t r li i u o t chart. ver  that  eriod,  he elocity  f 2  was relatively  able  nless  he O p t v o M st u t opportunity st f  holding 2  balances aried. co o M v

Your  next hart  hows our  forecast   a  sharp ecline  n  M3  velocity is  ear c s of d i th y that  ollows rom  the taff's  ojection f f s pr of 6-3/4 percent  rowth  of 3.  At  more g M than  a 3 percent  nnual  rate  f  decline, e ine  his  ear s ot nly  steeper an a o th l t y i n o th

the  nearly   percent  rend ate f ecline  ver  the hree  ecades rior  o he  1990s 1 t r o d o t d p t t but  it s lso teeper  han  the  percent  verage ate  f  contraction er he hree i a s t 2 a r o ov t t prior  ears.

Our projection    that  he rowth  of he ebt f  domestic onfinancial ctors, is t g t d o n se at  5-1/4  percent, so ill xceed hat f  nominal  GDP  by  a  sizable  argin.  Hence, al w e t o m projected  ebt elocity,    shown in  the ower anel f his  hart,  alls  his  ear t d v as l p o t c f t y a almost  a  2  percent  ace. s may be  seen  in his  anel,  part  rom  the xceptional p A t p a f e drop  in  debt elocity  uring he  1980s, his  atio  as  evinced ittle  end ince he v d t t r h l tr s t early 960s.  The fall  n  debt elocity is  ear ostly eflects  rger  usiness 1 i v th y m r la b borrowing  necessitated    flagging  orporate  arnings  nd  greater  erger-related by c e a m retirements   equity. of

Turning  back  to  the able, ree  lternative  ts  f anges re resented  or t th a se o r a p f Committee  consideration. ternative etains  he rovisional ecifications t Al I  r t p sp tha the  Committee  chose  last  uly. n  recent  ears,  he OMC J I y t F has  not nterpreted  e i th ranges or road  money as  suggestive   its  xpectations r rowth  over  the ear f b of e fo g y or  two  covered y  the  ranges. nstead, cause  of ontinued  eightened b I be c h uncertainty out  the  demand for road  money,  the ommittee  has  interpreted  e ab b C th ranges  as  being onsistent  th  the rend  f  money growth  under onditions c wi t o c of price tability.  th  true rice  tability, inal  GDP  would  grow at   rate f s Wi p s nom a o around  3  percent  ach  year;  hat  ncrease  omposed of easured  potential al e t i isc m re growth  of  2-1/2  percent  nd  an upward  bias  n  the DP  price ndex  of   bit  ore a i G i a m than  1/2  percentage  oint. f 2 were  flat  nd  V3 were  to rend own by 1  percent p I V a t d as  was the ase  in he hree  ecades rior  o he  1990s, hen he  midpoints f  the c t t d p t t t t o provisional  anges f  alternative  ould  match  the xpected rowth  of 2  and r o I  w e g M M3  under  price tability. s

The  FOMC has  interpreted  e  3  to  7  percent  ebt ange f lternative th d r o a I differently  an he anges or he  monetary  aggregates.  he Committee  has th t r f t T intended  he  debt ange  to  encompass  the ikely owth  of  debt ver  the ear n t r l gr o y i question.  he  actual  rowth  rates  f  debt ver  the ast  hree  ears,  n act, rned T g o o l t y i f tu out  fairly ose  o  the  percent  idpoint f his  ange. his  5  percent  idpoint, cl t 5 m o t r T m however,  would  be  too  high o haracterize  r  expectation r rend  ebt rowth t c ou fo t d g under  conditions   price tability. we have  seen, ebt  velocity  as  tended o of s As d h t stay bout  constant, art rom  its  ecline  uring he  unusual ecade  of he  1980s. a ap f d d t d t Alternative  II he  table  djusts  he ebt ange  down to  2  to  6  percent, tching I in  t a t d r ma the  provisional    range  and  in ffect  oving the ationale  r he  debt ange M3 e m r fo t r closer  o ne  consistent  th rend ebt rowth  over ime  under  conditions t o wi t d g t of

price tability.  der  alternative all hree anges ould  be  roughly onsistent s Un II, t r w c with  price  tability. s

Because  the taff  rojects  step-up  f  debt rowth  from s p a o g 4-1/2 percent  ast  ear l y to 5-1/4 percent  his  ear,  hough,  he  Committee  may not onsider  998  to  be  an t y t t c 1 auspicious  ear  to armonize  the ationale r he ebt ange  with  that  f oth y h r fo t d r o b broad  monetary  aggregates.  f he ommittee  chooses o eave he  debt ange  and I t C t l t r its  ationale  changed  at his  eeting,  t  ay wish  to  consider  lternative r un t m i m a II. This  alternative  compasses  the  expected rowth  this  ear  of ll hree ggregates. en g y a t a Thus,  it  akes the ationale r 3  more like he amiliar e  for ebt n  the m r fo M t f on d i provisional nges.  It  aises  he  M3  range o  to  percent,   that  he pper nd ra r t t 3 7 so t u e is bove  the  staff's  ojection   6-3/4  percent  3  growth  this  ear. f  course, a pr of M y O raising e  M3  range ven  more,  say o   to  percent,  ould  come even  closer  o th e t 4 8 w t centering  he ange round  expected 3  growth  for his  ear. ut  such  a  move t r a M t y B would  depart  ven  further om  the pecified nge or rend  3  growth  consistent e fr s ra f t M with  price  tability, ing  it  ven  more wrenching  in  some  future  ear o eturn s mak e y t r to  a  price  tability ionale r he 3  range. s rat fo t M

Even  M2  velocity havior ay not  have o wh M be m returned  ll  he ay to ormal.  Specifically,   staff   still sure hether  any a t w n the is un w significant  trend f  V2 independent  f  the pportunity st f olding  2 up o o o co o h M balances  ill esume  in he  years head  as  financial novations   perceptions w r t a in or of attractive  turns  ead ouseholds  o  diversify  rther  heir  avings way from  M2 re l h t fu t s a balances.  ny such  uptrend s nlikely  o  be  of  the imensions f he  shift  he A i u t d o t int early 990s,  but  the ossibility  continued  hifts   money holders'  ortfolio 1 p of s in p preferences kes projecting  e  future  ehavior  f  V2 still ror  rone. ma th b o er p

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I  am looking  t  the ower rame  of hart . It a l f C 6 illustrates  arly  he ndependent  ise  n  V2 at ny  given pportunity st,  ecause he cle t i r i a o co b t opportunity  ost as  not  moved very  much. c h

MR. LINDSEY. On balance,  t  as  not; hat's ght. i h t ri

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The behavior  f  V2 since id-1994  had  suggested o m to  us  earlier  at  he elationship    V2 to  opportunity st as moving back  to  its th t r of co w previous attern  n he eriod rom  1959 through 989. Does the  more  recent  attern p i t p f 1 p

MR.  LINDSEY. That  is he pen  question.  t s rue  hat  e think  he  velocity t o I i t t w t of M2  since id-1994  has  moved more closely  o ts  ehavior ver he hree  ecades  prior m t i b o t t d to  the  1990s.  However,  it  lso s rue--and  sent he OMC a i t we t F a  memo  to his  ffect--that t e we can  fit  n  equation  ith nly 2  velocity, portunity st,  nd  a  time rend  rom a w o M op co a t f mid-1994  to  mid-1997  that  ives n  annual rowth  trend f  1-1/4  percentage  oints.  e g a g o p W certainly   not ee  that  ptrend n  the ast  art f  1997,  as  one  can  see rom  the hart, r do s u i l p o f c no do  we foresee  uch  an  uptrend oing  forward ecause  as  I  mentioned  in y briefing, s g b m we anticipate  me weakening  in  stock rices  n  1998. The latter ould,  s  I  said, so p i sh a short-circuit  e residual end  oward  increasing locity. wever,  we are  somewhat som tr t ve Ho unsure f  what  the uture  olds n  store.  t  s rue hat  e have  estimated    model over o f h i I i t t w a this  hole  period  hat  n he arly 990s  has  velocity ange  starting   ove in   gradual w t i t e 1 ch tom a "S" pattern.  his  model  fits cent  ears etter  han ny  of ur ther  odels.  It uggests T re y b t a o o m s that  he esidual  ptrend f  V2 in  1998  will e  only bout  0.2 ercentage  oint, rtually t r u o b a p p vi zero, nd  that  t  ill ove down to .1  percentage  oint  n  1999. So,  to  the xtent  e a i w m 0 p i e w believe  he S" pattern  ndicates at  he pdrift  elocity  s radually  oming  to  an  end, t " i th t u inv i g c we would  not  anticipate  ch of n uptrend  n  velocity  oing  forward. hether  one  can mu a i g W believe  hat  s,  s  I  say, n  open  question.  ersonally, eel  airly certain  bout he t i a a P I  f f un a t behavior f  V2 going  forward,  ut aving  said hat,  certainly  el  ore secure han  I  did o b h t I fe m t as  we went  through he arly 990s  and  observed hat  xtreme  updrift. t e 1 t e

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You mentioned he  stock arket  as  being  the t m reason or ringing  own V2 through he orecast  eriod,  ther  hings  qual.  Have you f b d t f p o t e

tried  o ut  stock rices  n  as  an additional riable   your  model to ee  if  nything t p p i va in s a happens?

MR.  LINDSEY. We  have  estimated    variety  f 2+  and  M3+  models  in  an a o M effort   capture  he on-M2 or  non-M3 components  of  those roader easures.  We  have o t n b m had  some success ut  not   perfect ccess. ne issue  s hat  nflows  o  stock utual b a su O i t i t m funds ere  negatively  orrelated  th  inflows  o  M2  until  he ast  wo  years. nflows  o w c wi t t l t I t both  M2  and  stock utual  funds ubsequently creased  o  fairly pid ates,   they m s in t ra r so became positively  rrelated.  ould e  pointed  ut  that  pending lso as strong, co Itc b o s a w tending  o rovide   third  eason or hat  ositive rrelation. ould  not ay  we were t p a r f t p co I  w s entirely ccessful   our  efforts   construct dels  that  apture  ell he ehavior  f su in to mo c w t b o M2+  or  M3+.  I  would  be  interested   on Kohn's  view  of hat,  hough. inD t t

MR. KOHN. In  a  technical mo  that  as circulated  me six onths  ago,  we me w so m put  in  stock nd  bond  mutual  funds,  nd  we came away at hat  ime  with  some sense hat a a t t t when the  growth  of hose unds  was strong,   was weak.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Further  uestions? ho  would  like  o  start e q W t h Committee discussion?  overnor  Meyer. G

MR. MEYER. Whenever we talk  bout he  monetary  aggregate  anges,  t  eems a t r i s to  me we are lways  caught etween  two  kinds f ecisions: ether e want  to  confirm a b o d wh w or  change  the nterpretation  give  to he  ranges nd  what  boundaries  e want  to  set. i we t a w The staff  resentation  day eminds  us  that  he anges re  set nconsistently erms f p to r t r a i in  t o their  nterpretation,    we have  an  opportunity  ake them  more consistent.    and i and tom M2 M3  are  set ccording  o  what  I  call    "price  tability" ionale,   that  s onsistent  th a t a s rat one i c wi price  tability  d  normal  velocity havior, d  debt s et ccording o  what  I  call s an be an i s a t a "projections"  terpretation. in

It eems to  me that  he rinciple   consistency s  some value ere.  think  he s t p of ha h I t ranges hould e  set onsistently  th  one  another.  e  could  argue s  to hether  the s b c wi W a w "price  tability"  the projections"  terpretation  he  one  we want  to  use.  In  my view, s or " in is t the  choice etween  those wo  involves  wo  principles. e I  call  onvenience. s long b t t On c A as  there  s   lot f ncertainty   projected  otential stability  he  aggregates, e i a o u or p in in  t th

"price  tability" erpretation  ather  onvenient.  he other  rinciple  onsistency s int is r c T p isc with  Humphrey-Hawkins, or  the  spirit  umphrey-Hawkins, and  that  ould  make me ofH w lean  toward he  "projections"  terpretation. t in

In  the idst f  concern bout he  instability he onetary  aggregates,  am m o a t of  t m I comfortable  ith  the price  tability" ionale til  tability  erges  long  enough  for s w " s rat un s em u to  move back  to  a  "projections"  terpretation. en  that,  prefer  he pirit   alternative in Giv I t s of III.  In  particular, nnot hink f   good  rationale r lternative ecause  all t  oes  is I  ca t o a fo a IIb i d change  which  aggregate  s nconsistent  th he ther  wo.  Now, while   like  lternative i i wi t o t I a III in  principle,  o not hink  he iming or oving to hat  lternative articularly I  d t t t f m t a is p good.  On the  one  hand, e would  be  lowering ur arget  ange  for ebt nd  raising  ur w o t r d a o forecast  f ts  rowth.  On the ther,  e would  be  drawing  attention   he onetary o i g o w tot m aggregates  t  a  time hen we do  not ecessarily  nt  to  signal  hat  e are  going o  place a w n wa t w t more emphasis  on  them.  So,  I ould  prefer  o etain  lternative nd  as  the rowth  rate w t r a I, a g projections  r he  debt ggregate  ecline  ver ime  and  become more consistent  th  the fo t a d o t wi "price  tability"  tionale--if  hould ccur--we ould  then  lower he  debt ange  and s ra thats o c t r change  its  nterpretation, i too.

One other bservation  hat    would  bring p  relates   the anges or  he 2 o t I u to r f t M aggregate.  he staff s  made a  very  good  point  hat  he 2  range  seems  to  be  almost T ha t t M perfectly ntered  n  virtual ice tability. mplies    1/2 percent  ncrease  n  inflation. ce o pr s It  i a i i So,  it  ight  be  said hat,   voting or lternative e are aying hat  rice tability m t by f a I,w s t p s is indeed  our  long-run  nflation  rget  nd  is hat  we intend  o chieve.   want  to ome i ta a w t a I c back  to hat  ssue  n  my  policy  osition atement, t   do  not ant  my preference r t i i p st bu I w fo alternative  ecessarily    carry hat  mplication.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  roaddus. B

MR. BROADDUS. On the  ranges,    think he ain  thing  e need  to  do  is o I t m w t leave  the 2  range here it  s oday t  1  to  percent.  hat  would  serve oth  as  a  signal M w i t a 5 T b of  our ontinuing  ommitment to  price tability   operationally    a  likely  ate  f 2 c c s and as r o M growth  that  ould  be  consistent th  maintaining  he ow  inflation  vironment e are w wi t l en w now enjoying. ll  three  lternatives e  a  1  to  percent  ange  for 2, so  I  am relatively A a hav 5 r M indifferent  ong them. In  this  egard,  t  s orth  noting,  s  Dave Lindsey  indicated,  at am r i i w a th there  s ome evidence hat  he  standard  2  demand equation  s oming  back  on  track. i s t t M i c So,  at east  ome case  can  be  made for  iving 2  a  little e weight.  I ecognize  he l s g M mor r t uncertainties t re  involved,  ut  I  believe    little  re weight o  M2  would  be tha a b a mo t desirable   our  deliberations ng  forward. n  that  ontext,  eems  worth  noting  hat  f in goi I c its t i in  fact  2  is oming  back  on  track  ith  little   o  velocity  rend, e nnual  rate  f 2 M c w orn t th a o M growth  close  o  7 percent  hat  e have  seen  recently  learly consistent  th t t w isc in wi maintaining  he rogress  e have  made in  reducing  nflation. t p w i

At  our umphrey-Hawkins meeting  in uly f  last  ear,    made my usual lea,  r. H J o y I p M Chairman,  that  e consider  etting,  e  way or nother,   explicit  t  least    somewhat w s on a an ora a more concrete  nd  precise  onger-term  nflation  jective. couple f ecent a l i ob A o r developments ake me want  to ut  that  ssue  ack  on  the  table  nd  I  will ry o  do  so m p i b a t t very  briefly.  irst,  are  very lose o rice tability ht  ow--candidly,  lot  loser F we c t p s rig n a c than  I hought ast  ear  or  maybe a  year nd  a  half  go  we would  be  at his  ime. ith  the t l y a a t t W measured  CPI  currently ound  2 percent  nd  with  an  upward  bias f round  1  percent, ar a o a the  true nderlying  ate  f  inflation  y now be  at   percent  r erhaps   little  gher. u r o ma 1 o p a hi That  has  a  couple  f mplications    I  see  it.  ne is hat  e no longer  eed  to  get ung  up o i as O t w n h

on  the opic f  the ransition  sts f oving  back  to rice tability.  are  already  here t o t co o m p s We t essentially.  hink hat  s   powerful rgument  for rying  o ock n  price tability I  t t i a a t t l i s by announcing  a  somewhat more specific flation  jective.  lso, ith  inflation    low  as in ob A w as it  s urrently,  e ublic as  become more aware  of nd  more  concerned  about eflation. i c th p h a d For  obvious nd  understandable  easons,  here  as  been  much more public omment a r t h c about  deflation cently  han  in  the ast.  n  effect, e  might  say e recently  ave  gone re t p I on w h through   mini-deflation  are. n  the urrent  ow inflation  vironment,  t  eems  to  me a sc I c l en i s that ur  longer-term  olicy  trategy w needs  to ddress  eflation ncerns s  well  as o p s no a d co a inflation  ncerns. co

For  that  eason,   elieve  e should onsider  tating plicitly  ower  bound  for r Ib w c s ex a  l our  longer-term flation  jective.  ould e  zero n  an accurate  rice ndex r  maybe in ob Itc b o p i o 1  percent  r o  on  the ctual  easured  CPI.  We  would  explain  ow we would avoid o s a m h going  below  that  ower ound.  If e did  that, hink  t ould  help o larify r  strategy l b w I  t i w t c ou for ituations  at  ave  begun  to eceive  ome attention  ry  recently t hat, s th h r s ve bu t understandably,  d  not  previously  eceived    lot  f ttention r our r  five ecades. n ha r a o a fo f o d I my view,  that  ould elp  us  avoid etting to he ind  of ituation  e apanese ave c h g in t k s th J h found  themselves  n  from  time o ime  in  recent  ears.  Of  course,  f  e announce  a i t t y i w lower  bound on  inflation, n t  ould  make sense or s  to nnounce  simultaneously the i w f u a an explicit per  bound  as  well.  It ight  be  in he eighborhood f  percent  n  the up m t n o 3 o measured  CPI.  Even economists  ho think  hat  ome inflation   esirable r ne  reason w t s isd fo o or  another  enerally  gree hat  nflation  er  3 percent  r  so  is xcessive.  n  any  event,  f g a t i ov o e I i we did  set   lower ound,   believe  e would  have  to  set n  upper  bound  because f  e a b I w a i w

did  not,  e would invite edibility blems.  That  is ne  reason or iving trong w cr pro o f g s consideration   an  upper  inflation  mit  oday. to li t

Very briefly,  e ther onsideration  at    believe  trengthens e ase or   more th o c th I s th c f a concrete  nflation  jective,  d  broadens t  ncidentally  include    Congressional i ob an i i to a mandate  for rice tability,  ecent  iscal  evelopments. e  all now that  here re p s is r f d W k t a major  fiscal allenges  till  cing  he ation  n  the ong un.

The  cautionary te hat    tried  o b it i no t I t sound  in  this  egard  as that  ome of hose hocks  may look  as  if  hey re  lowering  he r w s t s t a t NAIRU,  and  the roductivity  ock  is   very ood  example.  That  was a  big  shock,   one p sh a g a percentage  oint  hock.  It rovided n  example  of  a  situation  ere  you  could eep  the p s p a wh k unemployment rate  ow and  have  low  inflation r   while.  Then you  had  a  choice s  to l fo a a how you  wanted  to  take he ffect  ltimately,  ether s  permanently ow inflation    an t e u wh a l or extended tretch  f  low unemployment.

MR.  KOHN. I'm  not ware of ny  asymmetry  in  the odeling  exercises,  t a a m bu I think  here s symmetry  in  the ormal  course f aising  nd  lowering ates.  ne point t i a n o r a r O that    tried  o onvey  and  have  the ommittee  begin o  think bout elates   situations I t c C t a r to when inflation  d  nominal  interest tes  re own to  very  low levels, ough  we an ra a d th certainly e  not here. e  have  a  nominal  funds  rate  f ar t W o 5-1/2 percent  ight  ow. But  one r n

can  imagine  the conomy running long t  a  1  percent  nflation  te nd  a  2  or  3 percent e a a i ra a nominal  funds  rate.  he economy then  gets it y  a  shock, nd  policymakers  ave  that T h b a h zero  constraint    the  nominal  funds ate  hat  s edeviling e apanese ight  ow.  So, on r t i b th J r n there re  some asymmetries rom  that  erspective. ere  is o  limit  n how high  a a f p Th n o nominal  rate an  go, ut  there  s   downside  limit  t ero.

MS. MINEHAN. I  am  trying  o ranslate  at  nto hinking  bout ow t t th i t a h forward-looking netary  policy  eeds  to  be.  You seem to  say  that  here  s t  least  ome mo n t i a s logic o  being ore  forward-looking  f  e think  he  economy is oing o  be  weaker  in  the t m i w t g t future, rticularly en  where  we are. pa giv

MR. KOHN. If e are  at   very ow rate  f nflation. w a l o i

MR. KOHN.

MR.  PRELL.  May  I ust  nject  thought?

MR.  MEYER. Mr.  Chairman,  I  support our  recommendation.  I  want  to  say  a y word about  what  I  think    symmetric  directive  ans. Sometimes, ne  thinks  f t s a me o o i a meaning  that  here  s n  equal robability  at  he ext olicy ove might  be  up or  down. t i a p th t n p m I  do  believe, ven  the ight  abor arkets nd  the  continuing  trength  f emand,  that gi t l m a s o d the ext  move still   ore likely  o e  up--that ere  s hat  pside isk.  n the  other n ism t b h i t u r O hand,  I  think    symmetric  directive gnals  ur  readiness  espond apidly  o  a  sharper a si o tor r t downdrift  rom  Asia  than  we foresee  n  the aseline  orecast. f i b f

I  also ant  to ome back  and  mention  something bout he onger-run w c a t l simulations.  eems to  me that  he wo-day  meetings e have  twice   year re  an Its t t w a a opportunity   think  bout  some of he  longer-range rategic  sues  acing onetary to a t st is f m policy  ather  han lways  focusing  eeting  by  meeting  on  just  ne  decision.  n  my  view, r t a m o I that  s he alue f he  simulations   alternative  licy  trategies  at  he taff s i t v o t of po s th t s ha presented  o  us.  In  those imulations ey onsidered, r xample,  couple f  options t s th c fo e a o

for  longer-term  onetary  policy--either tabilize  flation     percent r o  reduce  it m to  s in at2 o t further , ay,  1  percent  or he CE. As I  read hat, e uestion  ccurred o  me,  why do to s f t P t th q o t we make the  staff ess  at ur  longer-range flation  rget?  ne of  the easons  ight  be gu o in ta O r m that  e are  uncertain  urselves  bout ur  long-range  nflation  rget  ecause f ssues w o a o i ta b o i relating   the erils  f eflation.  we want  to enter  ur  inflation  rget  n  the  long un to p o d Do c o ta i r on  true  ero nflation    that    typical cession  ould always  be  accompanied  by z i so a re w deflation?

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  tem. S

MR.  STERN. I  agree ith  your ecommendation  as  well.   also ant  to  endorse w r I w the  comments made by  President oaddus  and  Governor  Meyer. They were  implicit Br in some of on Kohn's  comments as  well.  Now  that nflation  s  come down a  good  deal, D i ha I think  t s mportant  hat  e focus ore specifically  what  we view  as  our  price i i i t w m on objective.  say  that  ot nly ecause  it  ay help s  to  communicate  to he ublic hat I n o b m u t p w we are  trying  o  do, ut   believe  t  ill elp he nner  orkings f he ommittee  over t b I i w h t i w o t C time.  So,  I ould agree hat  e should pend  some time  on  that  ssue  n  July. w t w s i i

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Of  course,  hat  has  happened  to  us  is hat  he ost w t t c of  lowering nflation  at  e always  presumed  to e  negative  as  turned ut o  be i th w b h o t positive.  e  have  been  given   bonus  that  e did ot arn.  The  question  s,  o  we make W a w n e i d good  use  of t  r o  we dissipate  ? hat  may well e  the sefulness  f rying  o ocus n i o d it T b u o t t f o where  we want  to  go  and  what  we should o  from  here.  I  think  he ssues  aised  n ur d t i r i o earlier  scussions   the ature  f  prices  nd  where  we are n elation  rice  tability di of n o a i r top s are  becoming quite  mportant, pecially   l Broaddus  turns  ut  to  be  more cautious i es ifA o than  he  needs  to e  and  the sian  crisis s  a  more  deflationary  fect  n  our conomy b A ha ef o e than  we now anticipate.  esident  inehan.

MS. MINEHAN. I  very  much  favor  our  recommendation, r.  Chairman. I y M agree  it  ould  be  useful  o evisit  r  discussions out nflation  en  though  we have w t r ou ab i ev had  many of  them  without oming  to  any  hard onclusions.  aybe it  ill e  more c c M w b productive  his  ime n  the ense hat  e will ave  a  longer  eriod f  low  inflation t t i s t w h p o to

MR.  GUYNN. I  support  our  recommendation, r.  Chairman. y M

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  ordan. J

MR.  JORDAN. With the  obvious dvantage f  some hindsight, ow think  he a o I  n t thrust  f onetary  policy  n  1997 was more expansionary  han   thought  t he ime,  nd o m i t I a t t a it  ecame progressively  re expansionary  s  we went  through he ear.  There  is n b mo a t y a irony n  the ay we now look t  the  numbers  and  also n ow we communicate  them.  A i w a i h favorable  roductivity  ock  or  surprise s  meant  that  he eal  ate f eturn  n  capital p sh ha t r r o r o was higher  x  post han e had  anticipated    ante nd  that  elative    nominal  interest e t w ex a r or rates,  specially  e  overnight  nterbank  ate, rned  ut o e  lower  ex  post han e had e th i r tu o t b t w expected x  ante.  This  manifests  tself    what  we see  happening n he inancial e i in i t f industry,  e  banking ndustry,  d  in  various  easures  of oney and  credit  rowth.  The th i an m m g irony s hat  he  way a  favorable  roductivity  ock  is eported  mplies ot nly hat eal i t t p sh r i n o t r incomes  are igher han hey  would  otherwise  ave  been, hich  is ertainly  desirable h t t h w c a outcome,  but  it  lso  s anifested  n he orm  of   lower  level f easured  price  nflation a i m i t f a o m i than  would  otherwise  ave  occurred.  herefore,  he hange  over   short  nterval h T t c a i in

indices  ike  he  consumer  price  ndex  makes it  ppear hat  e have  higher  eal nterest l t i a t w r i rates,  or   given  level  f ominal  rates, en in  fact  ur heory ells   it  as the f a o n wh o t t us w opposite.  e  had  lower  real  nterest  tes. W i ra

There  is o  question  bout he irection  he  effects  f he  Asian  influence. n a t d oft o t In the  statistics, rts  ill e  lower han hey  otherwise  ould  have  been, ut   am not expo w b t t w b I sure hat  that  evel  ould  have  been.  Imports ill e  greater  han hey therwise  ould w l w w b t t o w have  been.  In  an  arithmetic nse,  hose wo  developments ell  s  on  the asis f artial se t t t u b o p analysis  hat DP  is oing  to  be  smaller  han t therwise  ould  have  been.  But  that  s t G g t i o w i not  a  full  eneral  quilibrium fect.  ower  prices  f oth  imported oods  and  domestic g e ef L o b g goods  that  ompete  with  imports ean that  ncomes  are igher  han hey therwise  ould c m i h t t o w have  been.  I  now think hat  e would  have  been  looking  t ven  stronger minal t w a e no demand growth  coming  into his  ear,  ueled  y  rapid oney growth.  We  may benefit t y f b m by some amount--I'm  ncertain  bout  the  amount--of  ess  trong  emand than e would u a l s d w have  experienced  n  the bsence f he  Asian  developments,  ut   am not t ll  onvinced i a o t b I a a c that  emand is ctually  oing  to ecline  r  that  he ate  f  economic  growth  is oing o  be d a g d o t r o g t slower han  is eflected    the reenbook. t r in G

So,  I  think  he dds  are  strongly   the irection at ur ext ove will e  to  raise t o in d th o n m b the  funds ate  o  slow  the rowth  of oney and  credit.   are  going  to  see  a  substantial r t g m We acceleration    prices  ven  if t  s omewhat delayed. of e i i s
