July 28 Session

YELLEN.  Good morning, everyone.  Let's get started.  I'd like to once again the Dallas District, as well as York, and is an alternate on this Committee.  I'd also like to to his first FOMC meeting.  I think everybody knows that earlier this wide range of corporate and starting in looking forward to working with CHAIR welcome First Vice President Holcomb, who will be representing Michael Strine, who is back for his second meeting, but this time as first vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New welcome Patrick Harker month, Pat became president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.  He brings with him a distinguished record in academic research, many years of experience leading large and important institutions, and a long history of service on a nonprofit boards, including the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia 2012.  Let me just say, on behalf of everyone here, we're all you in the years ahead.

These probabilities, derived from federal funds futures contracts, declined following the June events and course, backing out physical probabilities from endeavor and requires numerous assumptions.  In addition, one now needs to make an assumption about where will trade in the expectation of 10 basis points above the bottom of the range from a question in the Desk surveys, while the light blue lines use the interquartile range of these expectations.

the pace of tightening will be this more in his briefing. Market participants generally continue to believe gradual, in line with recent communications from Federal Reserve officials.  Thomas will discuss increased somewhat since the start of the year as energy out and inflation readings stabilized.  Over this intermeeting period, steady despite a decline of 14 percent Longer-dated oil futures also declined.  The recent drop in oil appears to have been partly driven both by higher-than-expected supply from increased supply from Iran over the run after an agreement with major international powers cleared the way for the period.  Credit spreads outside One factor contributing to the gradual expected pace of tightening has been subdued readings of realized inflation.  Market-based measures of forward inflation remain notably below longer-run historical averages, as shown in the bottom-left panel, though they have prices bottomed forward inflation measures remained relatively in front-month Brent crude oil futures, in contrast to the highly correlated moves seen over the past year. prices Saudi Arabia and Iraq and by expectations for longer sanctions to be lifted.

As discussed in one of in Tealbook A, risks associated with Puerto Rico at present appear continued monitoring.

However, this dynamic appeared to reverse, and substantial additional conventional easing measures by the prices in the sharp correction over the intermeeting period.  Authorities announced new trading and and suggested they may undermine previous In response, Chinese officials implemented an unprecedented array of measures to halt targeted initiatives on a nearly daily basis, including easing margin collateral requirements, establishing an official stabilization fund to support the equity market, and suspending IPOs.  In addition, many firms requested that trading in their shares be halted as a result of the volatility.  Market participants noted these measures increased 'moral hazard' market reform efforts.

These results could suggest that term RRP participation was primarily driven by counterparties' desire to desire for incremental yield playing secondary role.  While the Desk's term operations were fully subscribed, ample operation over the June quarter-end date. Reverse repo operations conducted by the Desk proceeded smoothly over the intermeeting period.  In addition to its overnight operation, the Desk conducted two term operations over the June quarter-end, the results of which are detailed in your middle-left panel. offerings end term operations-at 3 basis points above 5 basis points over the ON RRP rate that was offered in March. of the term operations were shorter, and the attractiveness of the shorter appeared quarter-end secure investment over the quarter-end, with the a capacity remained in the overnight that our communication at the time of the June quarter-end term operations and other details, which were meeting.  This strategy allowed us to retain some to adjust the specific parameters of the operations in case the Committee for the September Recall took a different approach than in prior quarter-ends in that it separated the announcement of the term RRP offering size and tenor, which was released following the April minutes, from information on the offering rate released following the June FOMC flexibility decided to lift off at the June meeting.  This communications change caused little market reaction, and we propose continuing with this practice quarter-end.

Further, the statement would note that the Desk will release the remaining details of the term RRP operations after the September FOMC event and shortly ahead of quarter-end.  We would then come back to the Committee at or shortly and maximum offering rate for each operation.

In those comments, are they talking about historical strains during that period, or uncertainty about the liftoff MR. EVANS. time period, a new liquidity environment affecting that environment?

All right, that is the rule. MR. EVANS.

On 2013, I think I belittled their views a little bit about whether they'd made its statement.  I think they will be.  The slightly different Dudley talked about this at the June meeting-is that they're aware lot of movement in money markets as you come up to quarter-end, and there's a belief those could be more intense around year-end.  So there are some market participants who the FOMC would be wary of lifting off around year-end because of the ability to MR.

EVANS.  Okay, so that's along the lines of that Vice Chairman Dudley has mentioned before.  Thank you.

most of what we hear is just that market liquidity in lack of liquidity. MR. POTTER.  But I think that general is not as robust at the end of the year.  So if there's some noise around liftoff, then that could be exaggerated by that

MR. EVANS.  Okay.  All right.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota.

Chair.  Simon, I have a question exhibit 1.  My question is, what are the Desk's perspectives on why we now see between the price of oil and five-year, five-year breakevens? MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, thank you, Madam about panel 5 in deviations technical reasons-some a good explanation for the be in play, so that would make us perhaps doubt those MR. POTTER.  There's definitely-from some market seasonals in TIPS trading that could account for that.  We didn't have high correlation you can see in that chart earlier.  We looked for some explanations.  Some of those explanations should still explanations that we came up with before, because we were clutching at straws a lot.

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Right.

The only thing I'd note is that, in the past few days, the five-five forward five-year-five-year forward over the it still ended low. MR. POTTER. has come down, and that does seem to be in response to further falls in the prices of oil and metals.

Your third panel illustrates the in the draft directive that could apply if the cap was temporarily suspended, the SOMA that are available for such We believe this language is consistent with the spirit of a suspended cap at the same time highlighting the practical limitations that preclude unlimited ON RRPs.

The draft, however, retains the directive's broad instruction to the Desk to undertake open market operations 'as necessary' to keep its target range.  This language is followed by specific instructions to undertake overnight and term reverse repurchase agreements according to parameters approved by the Committee.

As Lorie noted, the staff is recommending MR. CLOUSE. implementation note will include support policy normalization.  Assuming that the FOMC initiates policy firming by raising the rate would be set at 25 basis points, reserves would both be at the April primary credit rate at the current spread of 50 basis points above the top of the target range for the federal funds rate for some time after liftoff.  As noted in bulleted item in the implementation 100 basis points immediately that all of these changes in administered rates take effect on the day following the FOMC announcement.

On the day of any meeting in which the FOMC changes the existing requests by Reserve Banks for discount rate changes to the new rate to be effective on the next business day.  In addition, any requests for discount rate changes from Reserve Banks received in the afternoon following the conclusion of the FOMC meeting or on the subsequent business day would be approved by the Board Secretary under delegated authority with the same effective date.  These procedures are the same as those that have been in place for two other forms of discount credit and seasonal credit-are set by formulas routinely 50 basis points above the primary credit rate.  The seasonal credit rate is every two weeks based on the average effective federal funds rate and the For completeness, it is worth noting that the rates for window lending-secondary proposed by the Reserve Banks and approved by the Board.  The secondary credit rate is set at established 90-day CD rate over the previous reserve maintenance period.  These rates are not included in the proposed implementation note because they have no significant implications for the process of policy normalization.

Moreover, the staff will brief immediately after liftoff policy implementation.  Those afternoon briefings can be readily converted to formal FOMC and implement any changes in the approach to policy normalization.

as discussed in previous FOMC meetings, the staff proposed a change to calculation of interest payments on reserves.  After a publicincreases in rate are immediately reflected in higher interest payments to depository effect that day.  That structure should help to ensure that an increase in the provides incentives for depository institutions to bid at higher in overnight funding markets and to require a rate of return at least as high as than reserve balances.  That concludes our Finally, the methodology for the comment period, the Board approved that change, and it became effective in the maintenance period that began last Thursday.  The change in methodology should support the role of IOER as a policy normalization tool by ensuring that the IOER institutions.

But we could reiterate the language used in which rerelease the Principles and

MR. TARULLO.  Okay.  Thank you.

YELLEN.  Other questions or comments?  President Kocherlakota. CHAIR

Chair.  I want to build on what Governor Tarullo think it would be useful for the Committee to have in mind exactly what cap on RRP.  It's clear there's a lot of not having a cap at liftoff, but at what point in time and under what conditions would I think we have talked about that some in the past, but perhaps I'm not just not MR.

I kind of conditionality would be driving the changes of the support for it be adjusted? remembering what kinds of conclusions we had reached about that.  And I think it would be useful for us to have, at least, a refresher on that.

My memory is that we used some language that was trying to get at the flexibility.  For example, there might be requirements for in the fall if there are complications associated with the debt limit.  And even though MR. POTTER. notion it was temporary, but gave some flexibility

The Board meeting has ended.  Now we're ready to move along to our next topic, which is reinvestment policy.  We're going to call on Beth Klee to start us off.

Remache and I will be referring to labeled 'Material for Briefing on SOMA Reinvestment Policy.' MS. KLEE. 3   Thank you, Madam Chair.  Julie the handout commence phasing out, reinvestments of principal on begins increasing the target range for the federal timing will depend on how economic and financial conditions and memo titled 'Reinvestments Considerations.' described several strategies that you could take and reviewed a range of each strategy.  We also suggested questions to help structure As you know, the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans state that the Committee expects to cease, or securities held in the SOMA after it funds rate, and that the economic outlook evolve.  As background for the Committee's discussion on reinvestments, the staff prepared the The memo issues associated with your discussion of this topic.

panels of your first exhibit summarize the strategies as well as some The Committee could strategy or make the date conditional on federal funds rate from 2011 to The top two pros and cons of each.  As shown in the top panel, the first set of strategies are calendar dependent-reinvestments would cease at a set date or after a specified interval following the initial firming of the federal funds rate. follow a strictly calendar-dependent macroeconomic conditions.  Of note, a conditional calendar-based strategy is similar to that employed in the forward guidance for the 2012.

You may want to use reinvestments if you are reinvestments will not be necessary effective approach to communicate economic conditionality.  As noted to the right, a calendar-based strategy would be relatively straightforward to communicate to the public.  In addition, it would offer some certainty regarding the timing of the ceasing of reinvestments, and by implication, the path of the SOMA portfolio.  These features could also be considered drawbacks in some circumstances, as this strategy could be seen as inflexible. some conditionality, it could be difficult if the economy behaves much differently than expected.  Under those Federal

offered qualitative guidance regarding the conditions under which the cease reinvestments-not unlike the current guidance for the As shown in the middle panel, the second set of strategies are state-dependent; reinvestments would cease based on specified economic conditions.  The Committee could follow a quantitative state-dependent strategy wherein redemptions would commence based on a particular macroeconomic threshold.  A quantitative statedependent threshold strategy was used to provide forward guidance about the federal funds rate from 2012 to 2014.  Another variation of a state-dependent strategy would be one that Committee expects to federal funds rate.

it enhances the 'automatic stabilizer function' of rapidly than expected, the cease sooner if the effective lower bound.  Important would be determining the appropriate threshold or trigger under a approach or being sufficiently clear about your reaction function under a less certainty about the You may want to employ a state-dependent strategy if you believe doing so provides clear communications or if monetary policy.  That is, if the economy improves less cessation of reinvestments would occur later; they would also economy improves more rapidly.  Consequently, a state-dependent strategy might also reduce the possibility of returning to the challenges quantitative qualitative approach.  A state-dependent approach provides path of SOMA assets, but that consideration might be seen as offset by the improved economic responsiveness of this strategy.

The that reinvestments cease the federal funds rate will be around that time.  The dashed blue line illustrates a scenario where continue for 16 months longer than in the the balance sheet is delayed only about 9 the balance sheet.  However, as shown in the a higher level when reinvestments end, zero lower bound scenarios.  Still, the and this suggests that the benefit modest.  Of course, it is possible that with ceasing reinvestments.

On the other hand, it normalization of the size of the portfolio by a few months. These concerns may support a decision to phase rather than ceasing them to reinvestments is not likely to lead to significant disruptions, phasing out reinvestments may provide insurance against this few quarters, would likely not have significantly different compared with a case in would lead to a slower decline in the portfolio, though the change would only extend the timing of the

the uneven pattern of redemptions.  As shown in the top panel of exhibit 3, maturing Treasury securities held by the SOMA-shown by the red vary over time as a function of prepayment margin, help the market absorb the phasing out to lend.  The SOMA has not held benchmark securities for some time the sales under the System's maturity extension program, but making lend from the SOMA is helpful when there is tightness in the market. The Committee may also wish to consider phasing out reinvestments in order to address the amount of bars-will vary between $2 billion and $39 billion per month in 2016.  Although the projection of MBS principal payments-shown by the blue bars-appears smooth and steady, actual prepayments will behavior.  Smoothing redemptions may, on the new supply without a noticeable effect on the overall trajectory of the balance sheet or the associated withdrawal of accommodation.  An incidental benefit of Treasury reinvestments over time would be to add Treasury benchmark securities to the SOMA portfolio during the reinvestment period, which could then be made available because of securities available to specials repo time, it could do so in a a decreasing payments to some extent.  Another approach could involve securities that would be allowed to mature or This would have a similar effect of slowing the reduction in the portfolio and Beth discussed, these strategies could be executed based they could be contingent on continued improvement in the staff work could be completed to evaluate these and other options If the Committee wished to phase reinvestments out over number of ways.  A straightforward approach would be to reinvest proportion of Treasury maturities or MBS principal payments over time.  This would result in a slower reduction in the portfolio and would smooth the pattern of maturities and principal setting a maximum dollar amount of prepay without reinvestment in each month and to increase the dollar amount over time. would smooth the pattern of reductions more directly.  As with the strategy to begin to cease reinvestments that on a set schedule, or economy.  Further should the Committee decide to phase out reinvestments.

[No response]  Seeing none, why don't we begin us off. CHAIR YELLEN.  Other questions? our go-round.  Governor Tarullo is going to start

July 28-29, 2015

some of the considerations that Beth and Julie have just raised, also because, while the funds rate and portfolio adjustments are both available monetary tools, we don't regard them as perfect substitutes for one another. MR. TARULLO.  Thank you very much, Madam Chair.  I begin from the premise that the issue of when to cease reinvestments of the SOMA portfolio needs discussion among policymakers not only because of but policy that were put to us in the staff memo, I want to start by what I think are the salient differences between them, for our purposes.  First, in our normalization policy, several participants have expressed the view that in the early stages of tightening so as to return as to a downturn in the economy.  The preference for federal funds rate reductions over purchases presumably arises from some combination of our sense of the about institutional or external reactions to another LSAP program.  This view seems might note in passing that the caution inherent in this view would also at the margin, for a delay in a start to tightening in order to reduce the Before answering the questions specifying previous discussions of we should use only federal funds rate increases quickly as we can to a point where material federal funds rate reductions would be available as a response additional SOMA relative efficacy of the two instruments in the contemplated deteriorating conditions and of concerns quite sensible, though I seem to argue, at least chances of a downturn that would require a policy reversal.

the possibility that through some combination of direct and in Treasury securities would more directly affect the now, the average duration of Treasury securities in our the supply of longer-duration bonds in the A second difference is signaling effects, cessation of reinvestments longer end of the yield curve.  Right portfolio is around seven years.  Reinvestments would probably have a duration of five to six years.  So stopping reinvestments would increase market.  This possibility would become significant if, as some observers have speculated, our

July 28-29, 2015

increases in the federal funds rate do not yield proportionate increases further out on the to be effective in the real economy.  Of course, if the shape of the curve were sheet size shouldn't affect yields.  But I think we've seen in recent years that actual changes in the supply of are not altogether driven by rational expectations of future initial curve, an outcome presumably of some importance if the Committee's efforts to tighten financial conditions are determined overwhelmingly by market expectations of future short-term rates plus a term premium, then theoretically an anticipated reduction in our balance longer-term securities can have some effects that conditions.

the ON RRP program becomes and remains larger because of the quantity of then the concerns I've previously expressed reduce its size. bill issuance and the speed with which banks begin to raise the rates they might be in the might of why we should keep the mind. Third, if reserves associated with our large balance sheet, with respect to financial stability might be mitigated through earlier measures to Of course, the size of the ON RRP after liftoff will depend on many factors, including the Treasury's decisions on pay on deposits.  And depending on when we began roll-offs, the mitigating effect pretty modest and more about signaling than direct effects.  But the possibility raised recent memo to Reserve Bank research directors-that the demand for ON RRP increase over time, rather than stabilize or decline-is another reminder financial-stability and market-structure issues in means that portfolio adjustment on mortgage markets relative to federal funds rate increases. are very likely to be important for our policies and which would be important only if Fourth, and finally, the fact that we hold a lot of MBS might have a disproportionate effect Our decisions on reinvestment policy will be usefully informed by considering which of these differences less probable contingencies were to arise.

July 28-29, 2015

react or medium-term downturn argues for pursuing initial tightening solely through federal less controversial-and arguably funds rate decreases.  But I wouldn't want to adopt a policy that ruled in the event that developments affecting the yield curve or made such a step advisable.  In short, my current thinking is that our raise rates several times before ending reinvestments, but that might move more quickly if we observe post-liftoff difficulties in these other areas. The fact that we don't know at the outset of normalization whether we will need to to a nearfunds rate increases so as to reacquire as quickly as possible the more effective-tool of out an earlier cessation of rollovers the ON RRP program presumption should be that we will we a inflation as triggers because those kinds of indicators are relevant to the of tightening through both instruments.  The reasons for maintaining some conditions, which would be capture in quantitative terms, especially because there are some quite the timing of the cessation of reinvestment Looking at things this way, I'd be disinclined to get very specific in an ex-ante communication strategy.  Calendar guidance, even conditional, would almost surely be read as near commitment.  And I don't see how to sensibly use economic indicators such as unemployment or overall pace optionality concerning portfolio practices pertain to financial particularly difficult to distinct considerations.  I think this argues for only a modest change in the policy we announced in our normalization principles last fall-namely, that will depend on how economic and financial conditions and the economic outlook evolve.

change would be to add something to reflect that aim of reacquiring interest reductions as a policy tool.  One possible formulation-although I'm sure there are others the thought, and I think Vice Chairman Dudley has got one-would be to balance sheet until the Bank rate The modest rate that would capture echo the Bank of England, which in various communications has indicated that the Monetary Policy Committee is not likely to change the size of the Bank's

July 28-29, 2015

It's been mentioned in some FAQs, referred to in its quarterly me very sensible for us to emulate the Bank of make too big a deal of all this so as to avoid creating specific expectations that is suggests to me that we should communicate this modest elaboration of our through the minutes or through an answer by the Chair to a question at a press has reached Bank of England has kept this position pretty general statements of Inflation Reports , and, in even more general terms, mentioned by Governor Carney in testimony to a parliamentary committee.  It seems to England and not might be taken as near commitments or used as benchmarks to evaluate how normalization going.  That intentions conference.

just suggested, assuming our first funds rate increase happens period of the charts that they distributed shows, we have a those four months.  Then there's a months followed by one higher month until early 2018, when the amounts and lower-maturity months increase substantially.  If we thought in terms of reinvestments in the second half of next year, we would have given ourselves time to federal funds rate increases, assuming the central tendency of the Committee holds, have a period of relatively low amounts maturing monthly so as not to tighten conditions very much via portfolio runoff, at least for a while. Next, I'd note that the bunching of maturing Treasuries in our portfolio would happily coincide with the approach I've later this year.  Right now, relatively small amounts are maturing each month.  But in the from February to May 2016, as one substantial jump in maturing Treasuries to $128 billion over pattern of a few low for both higherceasing make a few and yet still financial the issue of full cessation or phaseout of reinvestments, I feel and MBS.

However, in light maturation is quite uneven, I'd be interested in Simon Potter's there are other reasons to continue to roll over a modest amount for some Remache alluded to.

Thank you, Madam Chair. ceasing most reinvestments immediately or soon particularly of the fact that the pattern of views as to whether it would be a good idea to smooth out the reduction in our Treasury portfolio as well as whether period of time, which I think Julie accounts for a substantially greater share of that reinvestment of agency MBS, though as to precisely how, I advice from

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman. CHAIR

Now, this is effect in most states of the world, but it might be very helpful if the draw Turning to the first point, I come out pretty close the side of qualitative state-dependent guidance.

If the economy were weaker Reversing course and stopping the balance have that option-would be difficult by reducing short-term interest rates the zero lower bound.

This is motivated by my view that the end of reinvestments should be driven effective lower bound sometime in the likelihood simply cannot be summed up by a single parameter. at a relatively low federal funds rate if the or waiting a bit longer if the momentum were it might not be sustained in the future.  The I have in mind would read something like this, which I think tracks the economic outlook will not warrant a the zero lower bound in the next few years'-or something similar.  In my mind, this federal funds rate was at least were in place at that time. I prefer qualitative state-dependent guidance triggers for by the likelihood that we'll be forced to return to the relatively near future, and that For example, I could imagine ending reinvestments economy had considerable forward momentum less strong or if there were greater risks that qualitative standard that Bank of England approach:  'reasonable confidence that the return to probably would not imply ending reinvestments until the 1 percent, but probably even higher, depending on the economy's forward momentum and the risks to the outlook that major downside to qualitative state-dependent guidance is it makes it a much when we finally actually do decide to shrink the balance sheet.  Thus, there is a Now, the bigger deal greater risk, in this approach, of a bigger market reaction.  However, I think this risk can be

I, for not sure how to reconcile that with calendarI push the calendar-based guidance very far off into the future, an option Now, for calendar-based effect from the decision to begin to end the reinvestment process.  There's no signal from the decision in terms of timing-it's This means that when redemption and wind-down begin, not there's not offset by two significant negatives.  First, as represent a policy decisions are data accommodation, is data dependent, logic would imply that other means of tightening policy should also be data dependent.  Second, it seems to me that we want to be careful about ending reinvestments prematurely.  That is because once course-that is, to start reinvesting, and even harder to expand the balance sheet one, want to be highly confident that we are unlikely to have to return to the zero lower bound in the near future before ending reinvestments.  I'm based guidance unless that I don't think is reasonably on the table.

We just don't know what those risks are, and why you'd want to take a chance when you are not really sure how big those risks are. the normalization of the balance sheet are low as long as the taper is not as long as it's not stretched out for more than a year or so. because I'm not convinced tapering, you might want the risk to market functioning might differ.  But because tapering that market-functioning risk directly, then there no longer seems to be a case for made the decision to taper. Turning next to the issue of how to end reinvestments, I would favor tapering, and I would not distinguish between Treasury securities reduces I don't see Doing it this way also would be generally consistent with current market expectations.  The cost in terms of delaying stretched over a long period-that is, I wouldn't distinguish between Treasury securities and agency MBS that we really have a strong compelling reason to do so.  If you weren't to differentiate, because addresses differentiation once you've the way the Committee ultimately wants to go, the next length and the form of taper.  I assume you don't need to stretch out the of a taper.  With respect to the form of the taper, as Julie said, there are a have different characteristics in the risk to market function and the trajectory of the balance sheet.  I'm not sure which of the staff to come back with some tapering is the way to go, what is the best way to do it and why, not obvious?  Do you want to have more predictability on the amount of Now, assuming that tapering is question would be the taper very long, but I'd be interested in hearing from the staff about the pros and cons shorter versus longer number of ways to go.  You can reduce the amount of reinvestment by a fixed percentage each month, or you can reduce it by a fixed dollar amount.  These terms of these has better properties, frankly, so I would encourage proposals.  If we decide that because it's reinvestment being reduced each month, or do you want to have more predictability in terms of

I think it's do clarify what we think about reinvestments, because when we lift off, is going to go to the press conference and one of the first questions is going to be, I think the clarify that matter before we get to that point, I think that would be a good place for the path of the balance sheet each month?

[Laughter]  I've been in the job now making the same rookie mistakes anymore.  Like work better than others?'  And that led me to think the issue of what the strategy is, and from that perspective consider the tactics or it in terms of what's our strategy this. Like Governor Tarullo, I recall something that President Evans said when I questions in the roughly four and a quarter years, so I'm not Government Tarullo, I looked back and said, 'What are we trying to accomplish here?  Under what conditions would certain approaches again about some of the questions more in the context of thinking about with regard to the balance sheet-and I actually was struck by the fact the memo was kind of pushing this way-as an active policy tool on par with the funds rate. time to end think anyone would use the word 'taper' One possible strategy would treat that We're looking at economic conditions, looking at the forecast, deciding whether it's reinvestment or to pare back on reinvestment.  I didn't

surprised by that.  But really, you're thinking the balance sheet would be adjusted intentions the funds rate. again-I'm based on economic conditions, and our policy communications would highlight the about both the balance sheet and into the background, and reductions are aligned with the overall thrust of policy, obviously driven by our same way as the policy latter strategy. The other strategy is to put management of the balance sheet instead focus policy actions and communications squarely on the funds rate.  In this case, the balance sheet macroeconomic goals.  But they wouldn't be actively managed in the lever.  So I strongly prefer the

A is consistent with our other supporting tools in our normalization plans, such as the IOER and the And, finally, keeping the balance sheet actions in the earlier statement on policy normalization-that is, it The Committee and financial market participants have a much better understanding of and more confidence in using the federal funds rate to conduct and communicate monetary policy.

In addition, the primacy of the funds rate treatment of overnight reverse repo facilities. background would be consistent with our indicated that reductions in the size of the balance sheet would be gradual and predictable.

think our recent experience with funds with expanding the balance sheet through QE provides a couple of In the context of these strategic considerations, I rate forward guidance and important lessons for the future.  To begin with, date-based forward-looking policy statements boxed us in at times in arbitrary ways.  Similarly, setting policy thresholds based on economic variables proved problematic.  Thus, I would prefer not to use any date-based guidance-I'm

July 28-29, 2015

'six months' or some phrase like that-or economic variable thresholds for to start reducing the balance sheet.  With regard to using a specific threshold, I do see merits in that approach. linking our policy decisions and our tools together.  But I do think it could place thinking about communicating the conditions level of the funds rate-say, 1 percent-as a Specifically, it's undue attention and public speculation on what should be a relatively under-the-radar balance sheet action.

the Chair's eloquent public comments-namely, that we would ceasing reinvestment after the Committee was comfortable that the way.  I actually think that covers the comments a comfortable me respond to the Vice a whole box of issues about what does that mean and how do we measure reasonable confidence is something that's hard to define, as we've learned. What I would prefer is something qualitative.  There have been a couple of suggestions about this, but I personally prefer begin the process of normalization process was successfully under that we've already heard about having the interest rate high enough that we're in place, taking into account the zero lower bound.  Actually, let Chairman's comment.  I do think that this reasonable confidence that we won't return to the zero lower bound just opens it.  This timeline for normalizing the balance long.  The baseline Board staff projection says that our sheet will still be putting downward pressure on term premiums for another 10 years.  In before our retirements-all of our retirements-without too long to halt reinvestments. We should also keep in mind that the projected sheet, absent asset sales, is already quite balance order to normalize the balance sheet resorting to asset sales, we shouldn't wait

argument for the phaseout.  Obviously, if it's a phaseout over six months I still don't quite see the strong argument for I'd also prefer to end reinvestments without any kind of taper or phaseout period.  I'm still struggling with the or something, I wouldn't be opposed to that, but

July 28-29, 2015

So, again, maybe that's prudent against the possibility that this could be more of a problem. this.  Every time we've ended one of our QE programs or we've done the actually seen these market disruptions and dislocations understood being worried about them the first few times, but so worried about insurance gets us back into the game of, if we do 50 percent of reinvestments the first thinking about, it's going to lead to the question, 'Under what that it should be somewhat mechanical, like we the associated with this-just don't seem to be that I do think it time, or whatever we're conditions are you going to do the next step-down or step-up?,' or however you want to phrase that.  And so if we do a phaseout, I would argue did the taper-obviously, with language describing it, depending on economic conditions, but really be more on autopilot.  I would argue that markets do seem to be sufficiently deep, that flow considerations-again, a major concern important.  And I would handle MBS and Treasury securities in the same way in terms of ending the reinvestments.  Thank you very much.

In Second, balance sheet normalization should be conducted to reduce the taper tantrum-type disruptions by avoiding large, discrete changes.

envision a combination of funds rate policy and balance sheet reductions that path outlined in the most recent Tealbooks, although with a somewhat more gradual the federal funds initial increases.  But it's important to retain the sense of data and flexibility as we anticipate this next phase of our normalization.  The logic of our exit so that liftoff precedes redemptions is to ensure the balance sheet actions same logic, I suggest raising the In general, I follows the start to the redemption program.  That is, we would choose a liftoff date, raise rate a couple of times, and, if things go according to plan, begin a tapered reduction in reinvestments after those dependence sequencing would not delay liftoff from the zero lower bound.  Using that

In addition, the delay would provide time to assess the degree to which first set of actions has unexpectedly slowed the economy.  I would then select and path for redemptions that would reduce the chance of the announcement of balance taper tantrum.  I consider the announcement of the tapering federal funds off the zero lower bound and that we within our the increases in the federal funds rate are being transmitted to longer-term interest rates and whether our announce a sheet normalization creating a process as the third action in our tightening sequence.

Because earlier sheet suggest that $500 billion of purchases was roughly point decrease in the federal funds rate, a constant redemption flow of month for a year would translate to roughly a 25 basis point federal funds course of a year.  When a third tightening appears appropriate, I would Tealbook, a approach to tightening would be appropriate and the tapering process would be an to raising the federal funds rate at that meeting. After we set the conditional path for the federal funds rate would be the same criteria I would use for beginning the balance sheet normalization process.  I estimates of the effect of our balance equivalent to a 75 basis $15 billion a tightening over the announce the beginning of tapering of our balance sheet of $15 billion a month in redemptions. If additional tightening of financial conditions was required, we could raise the federal funds rate at the same time as beginning the tapering process.

There seems to said-we think it would be very costly for us to ever increase the balance Because if, when conditions are bad, we just go back up to $4 trillion, then I don't MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I had a two-hander, which actually is more a question for President Williams or Vice be an implicit notion that reducing the balance sheet will increase the probability of our hitting the zero lower bound.  I couldn't follow that logic.  Is it because-maybe I should go with what the Vice Chairman sheet again? see the argument.

In my judgment, there's not a huge appetite for that.

MR. EVANS.  Governor Tarullo said that explicitly.

So the notion is that once we start reducing the balance sheet, MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. we're going to be very averse to reversing that.

Let's just say that we prefer the federal fund rate tool to tool.  It doesn't mean the balance sheet tool isn't present, but we prefer the VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. the balance sheet funds rate tool.

fine, but even that doesn't quite get you there, because faced with a shock, then you're in the same place, MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  That's if you were willing to reverse course and get yourself back up to the amount of the balance sheet we have in place now, whenever you're essentially.

In fact, I think it's fair to say our reinvestment strategy, rather And I found this a little bit surprising, because just earlier this year we providing forward guidance on our interest rate policy and went instead to a for setting policy.  And in our normalization plan document last sales, but we didn't give any similar So, like President Williams, I found it useful to think first want to follow about our balance sheet and then to think about how we MR.

Much of the staff combines discussion of our strategy, especially what forward guidance the memo is virtually all about the forward guidance regarding than the strategy itself. ended the practice of meeting-by-meeting basis September, we promised to give advance notice about asset promise about reinvestment strategy. about what strategy we want to communicate about it.

end to reinvestment.  The early scenario is taken not going to quibble with that.  In entails more accommodative policy, the funds rate is somewhat steeper later reinvestment path.  But it only partially offsets the effect of a later end to Now, something stood out to me in the memo.  The memo provides two scenarios regarding macroeconomic variables-one under an assumption of an early end to reinvestment and the other under an assumption of a later from the June Tealbook, and so that involves a particular interest rate path, presumably chosen appropriately-or the staff's view of what's appropriate, I'm the late scenario, the interest rate policy follows an inertial Taylor rule.  Now, because a later end to reinvestment by itself in the reinvestment.  The unemployment path is, accordingly, lower, and inflation, marginally higher.

in the model would goal variables from the balance sheet effects of our reinvestment argued in the past that these balance sheet effects could be quite small, but let's set Now, the staff points out that a funds rate path could be chosen that completely insulate our strategy.  I've

July 28-29, 2015

think it makes more sense to compare scenarios complete-offset assumption.  In other words, under the setting interest rate policy appropriately.  If we're looking at a to assume that if we adopted that, our goal variables would be invariant under the two scenarios. that aside and just take these effects as given.  I in which we are under the sort of baseline, we're assuming we're different timing for reinvestment, I think the sensible thing is we would also set interest rate policy appropriately, and essentially that means projections regarding seems to a first are second-order issues, too-the useful way to think about it. pretty easy.  I think an array of political economy considerations make rather I think we'd prefer as small a financial-system footprint as possible while maintaining we start that strategy, the interval between liftoff and ending that important a question. So the main effect of the choice of reinvestment is on the path of our balance sheet.  We can sort of set aside unemployment and inflation.  Now, framed this way, that approximation-of course, there To me, the choice seems it attractive for us to normalize the size of our balance sheet as soon as possible-sooner than later. the ability to accomplish our objectives and live up to our promise not to sell assets.  I conclude that we should end reinvestment all at once, and soon.  Ideally, a meeting or two after raising rates seems reasonable.  Under reinvestment is relatively short, so forward guidance isn't really

decision about reinvestment on a immediately in the same way we announced the beginnings of our easing programs and the beginning of tapering and the like.  That would be to back away from forward guidance on interest rate instead to a meeting-by-meeting basis.  And I don't see why we need forward Now, it strikes me that we could easily make this meeting-by-meeting basis and, at the appropriate time, simply announce that we've decided to stop reinvestment effective quantitative consistent with our decision earlier this year policy, to go guidance on ending reinvestment.

I think if we're going some step like slowing down the end of reinvestments or delaying on the basis of the about market disruption, the Committee really ought to have a pretty concrete that happens, I'm not sure why we should care, and I'm not sure what that think we need a more Let me just comment on the discussion about phaseout and market functioning.  I have a history of questioning the staff on what they mean by market to take staff's conjectures handle on what in the world that means.  If prices move, if they get volatile on a couple of days, if something like should mean to us.  If there's something more fundamental, like some computers breaking down, I'd want to know about that-maybe that's worth taking onboard.  But I concrete account of what 'market disruption' means before we actually act on it.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

baseline scenario is as we always do using mechanically the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.  So that does not specific notion of appropriate policy but, instead, just mechanically applies Taylor until the percent.  For example, in the Risks and Uncertainty section of the (1999) rule to the deviations from the baseline.  I we simply let the inertial Taylor (1999) MR. LAUBACH.  President Lacker, just for clarification, the constructed start with a (1999).  We did basically the same in the alternative where the reinvestments continue federal funds rate hits 2 Tealbook, we are applying the inertial Taylor think the point that you highlighted-that, in principle, of course, the funds rate path could be adjusted to completely insulate the macroeconomy from the changes in reinvestment policy-is entirely correct.  It would just be more complex to run that scenario.  So policymakers respond to the deviations from baseline according to the rule.

July 28-29, 2015

same with a different reinvestment policy, you'd get the same outcome, right?  This application of the envelope theory, right? MR. LACKER.  Right.  So I stand corrected in my characterization of the baseline funds rate path.  The basic point is true, though.  If you're setting policy in one scenario, you can insulate them.  More broadly, if you took an optimal policy calculation in the baseline path and then did the is basically an

to follow up on that.  If we were to stop the to the zero lower bound.  So the ability almost immediately.  You'd be there's enough room, but if there's not much room, the ability to offset using the federal rate seems quite limited, so I think you'd have to pick one of those two.  If you really want not going to hit the zero lower MR. ROSENGREN.  Yes.  Just reinvestments very quickly, we might still be very close to offset seems a little bit inconsistent with starting the timing right if funds an offset, you need enough room to be very confident you're bound again.

worth thinking about.  In the macroeconomic literature, the treatment is that policy is sort of lexicographic, in that you only have the assets you zero.  When you get to zero, then the balance sheet is what models and a lot of discussions is last in, first out.  On balance sheet and then raising rates.  But we're doing reasons, we're doing something different.  We're raising rates sheet, and so we're getting away from that lexicographic MR. LACKER.  This is standard need when interest rates are above you use.  And the presumption in a lot of the way up, you're running off the something different-for various before we're running off the balance

I think it would be valid except for the concerns we just heard of our balance sheet when we get to the effective lower cut the size of the balance sheet, whenever we hit the effective lower bound, accommodation because of that cut.  So whenever we hit the effective in the future, because we've reduced the balance sheet-assuming unwilling to raise the size of the balance sheet-we're going to have less accommodation. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes.  I wanted to follow up on President Lacker's attempt build a about being willing to raise the size bound.  So if we've we're going to have less lower bound at any time we're

First, consistency with the document that we published in June September 2014 document established that and predictably, that the is, on the desire MBS will be part of normalization from the outset.  The document also said we do not anticipate selling MBS.  Everybody is familiar reinvestment policy should, broadly speaking, work in support our dual-mandate objectives.  This should not work counter to interest rate policy. simple, uncomplicated, and clear in the substance of policy and its communication.  In other words, I don't think our questions is preliminary, not as me.  I lean in favor of what I consider a the mechanics of ongoing interest rate policy implementation have been running smoothly.  Second, I do prefer a qualitative, state-dependent In the spirit of this go-round, my thinking on the developed as many of the people who went ahead of simple approach with these elements:  First, make the decision on the timing of ceasing reinvestments once operationalized and are

Even though will vary over time, a published maturity schedule should satisfy the predictability policy, the extent the variable schedule of rate policy, and any effect on market functioning. guidance approach.  Set conditions once we're that might come from balance sheet reductions criterion.

My preference is also to I don't see any clear benefits to adopting a more by ending reinvestments, that reinvestments will end sometime after we begin raising the federal funds rate, and that Whatever plan we choose should be adopt a simple approach, because at this point complicated one.  I think the main issues are determining the starting point for ending reinvestments and determining when to communicate our strategy.

I'd rather the sheet, in addition to interest rates, is a regular or active tool of monetary policy.  We've end of reinvestments based on the economy.  So the further in advance reinvestment strategy, the less strategy is, because we don't know precisely how the economy will While I would like the balance don't see balance sheet remain passive for a time after liftoff, so that we don't encourage the idea that the balance stated that we'll time the we want to communicate something more concrete about our reasonable a calendar-based evolve.

don't think the balance sheet tool of monetary policy is that I don't believe we have estimates of risk premiums and the real economy that are precise enough to be able to use it in for at least around this table, to think about ending reinvestments tied funds rate.  Essentially, this means that the economic conditions for ending they would be comfortable beginning reinvestments funds rate increases are essentially doing this. That leaves a state-dependent strategy.  Now, one reason I should be viewed as a regular its effect on that way.  This argues for not setting separate economic conditions for ending reinvestments. My preference would be, to the federal reinvestments are the same ones we'll be using to determine the appropriate target for the funds rate.  Participants who've said today that after a couple of federal

If the balance sheet effects are the subsequent path of the funds rate after the end account of that.  If an adverse shock were to hit the economy so that the to move back down, we could begin reinvestments again if need be. The staff rate hits 2 percent.  Under the Tealbook baseline, this means full almost two years after liftoff. reinvestments sooner-say, when the fund rate is larger than we thought, then we could adjust of reinvestments to take federal funds rate needs memo is when to convey information to the public Fed watchers-I'm not convinced that at liftoff or shortly thereafter we need to and what will be conveyed in the minutes of this meeting.  It would be useful to get to prepare One issue that was not raised in the about our reinvestment strategy.  While market participants are likely to turn attention to reinvestments once we lift off-indeed, there's already some discussion of this by market participants and say much more about our reinvestment strategy than we've already said in the normalization principles the Desk's view on how much advance notice market participants really need in order for the end of reinvestment.

If the market doesn't need much advance notice to prepare, then the Committee could introduce expected, funds rate increase.  We what we did when we began reducing our third LSAP program in December 2013.  You may recall that at the September 2013 meeting, the Committee introduced language saying that economic improvement since the start of the purchase program

Committee decided to wait for more evidence that the repeated this language in strength in the economy, but that the progress was sustainable before adjusting the pace of purchases.  It October, and then tapering commenced in December.  So we could use a similar approach here if we thought that it was important to give some advance notice.

to end reinvestments completely or phase them out over and treating Treasury securities and in the same way.  The pattern of redemptions already has some phaseout built in.  The we announce a path of gradual phaseout.  And as the staff memo when the SOMA net purchases of MBS fell more than $40 billion.  Indeed, ending CUSIPs in our SOMA portfolio.  So once we announce when reinvestments will end, they'll be able to estimate the path of MBS Finally, with regard to whether time, and whether to treat Treasuries or MBS differently, my initial thought is to keep it simple, like President Lockhart, by ending reinvestments all at once MBS macroeconomic effects will be the same whether we announce reinvestments are ending completely or whether indicated, market functioning was not adversely affected by the end of our first LSAP program in March 2010, reinvestments might aid market functioning because it will mean there will be more safe assets available for collateral and repo in the hands of the public.  In addition, market participants know the know the path of Treasury redemptions, and they'll redemptions.

When I first started thinking about when to cease reinvestments, my instinct was economic conditions.  After all, the size of the balance sheet is a monetary policy tool, and so it should be chosen in the same deliberate and comprehensive way rate decisions, or that we used to purchase the assets in the first place programs.  So I was fundamentally in the state-based camp, and I wanted not to tie us much before it was necessary.

But that isn't quite markets have an expectation of how large the balance sheet will be at each future announcement is that we're going to go early relative to those dates, we'll be If we go late relative to those dates, we'll be easing.  Further, if the markets have the reaction with the announcement, and then carrying it out people have, the more one has to of the effects that President Rosengren indicated a few minutes ago. However, the more I thought about powerful the effects of announcing the dates To a first approximation-maybe a bad one, but it's an approximation-one can say announcing the schedule for sales, when it comes, will be equivalent to a increase or decrease-I'll explain that in a minute-in the federal funds right.  The date.  If our tightening. reasonable foresight, we get most of doesn't have as much effect as one thinks.  The less foresight take into account all principle is that we should go late with the say that because I think the main thing we've got to avoid is getting back to the zero lower bound.  One of you said that will make us feel about not going back. I think, at the very general level, our announcement and with the beginning of the running off the portfolio.  I that that we want to go up using the two tools so we get to an interest rate comfortable

I was surprised to hear effect, measured in terms of an equivalent move be the empirical significance of the lower right-hand chart in exhibit 1 of the does suggest that waiting a year rates at any time.  I also think I've read a paper or indicating that the effect of the running off the portfolio will be in the direction larger portfolio is more expansionary, but that the size of the be relatively small. Now, let's go to the key point.  How big will President Rosengren talk about a 75 basis point in the federal funds rate, of some aspect of phasing.  I've seen no evidence that we'll anywhere near as powerful as that in the timing of selling off different parts of the portfolio.  I'm not quite sure of handout that we got on SOMA reinvestment policy, but it doesn't make much of a difference to interest heard a statement we all believe-namely, that a effects will staff to tell us how powerful this is.  If the whole thing is worth in running down from $4 billion to $1 billion, that's not huge. reverse the results of our empirical work on the quantitative lack of easing-and then we'll get the things regarding what you're saying future policy that I'm really not sure that you could just do that reversal and say, 'That's I think we have to ask the the equivalent of 25 basis points One is tempted to say, 'Well, we should just effect of quantitative easing-unless there's right answer.'  But there's so much expectation in these about what's going to happen.'  And the question is, what message are we sending now?

a problem.  I who've said we really don't want to go there.  And the reason I reached In fact, it seems to have just fallen reflects the conclusions we've all arrived at.  If these effects are I'd announce the beginning of the nonreinvestments relatively late to give us a safety cushion with regard to going back to zero, which I think for a variety of reasons is agree with those people that conclusion even before this discussion was, I've hardly heard anybody say around this table when bad news comes in, 'Okay, guys, let's do another QE.' off the table, and I assume that

If it's powerful, then powerful, we're going to have to have some these two instruments.  What do we expect when we sell off at a given rate?  If we expect very little we're going to have to think about what we're doing at each stage.

In the end, because I believe the effects are relatively small, I'll end up with quite a few of you.  I'd give President Lockhart I've never thought of programs for reinvestment as being cute, but I'm about it.  We don't want to be too cute if it isn't that important.  If it is that important, to be a little some extent, Governor Tarullo-mentioned.

high hurdle for making changes in the pace of our balance sheet reductions. MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I prefer the qualitative state-dependent approach to initiating changes to our reinvestment policies.  However, once we start, I think there should be a this is the biggest issue.  I think a lot of what we're Before we being altering our reinvestments, I think we should be well under way in the funds rate normalization process, and I think

July 28-29, 2015

rates, and that translates into some equivalent to a point at which the funds rate is high enough, there's that can be done with the funds rate itself or the funds rate path trajectorywhen the funds rate is a viable I think it takes care of a lot of these issues.  By that time, I expect everything strong economic outlook and inflation rising toward thought Governor Tarullo's comments on the Bank of England guidance along these policy rate being high enough were particularly appropriate and helpful. talking about comes down to this:  We don't know the effect of the balance sheet adjustments and how they are going to affect longer-term increase in the funds rate.  If we get some offset somebody said this earlier as well.  So once we get to the point separate tool, should be working smoothly, with a 2 percent.  I lines of the is our primary tool for monetary policy. reductions on 'cruise control' as much as possible. exit-principles statement that we will reduce security At that point, we should follow through on our stated goal of returning to a traditional policy environment in which adjusting the funds rate This would mean putting our balance sheet We should do this in accordance with our holdings in a gradual and predictable manner.

as to be reasonably confident that we will be able to adequately respond to have an aspect of 'we'll know it when we see the best starting rule for ending reinvestments is one that is I hope we won't need to adjust our reinvestment policies regularly, and certainly not another policy lever, if things are going well.  This means that before we begin to cease reinvestments, we ought future shocks through adjustments in the funds rate.  This judgment regarding how high the funds rate needs to be before we alter our reinvestments is going to depend on the evolution of the economic environment and undoubtedly will it.'  This leads me to think that qualitative and state dependent.

July 28-29, 2015

defer judgment to the Desk on how best to engineer the gradual memo, I infer that the Desk would taper reinvestments, at least for a while, to insure against market disruption.  I'm fine at the start and understand that we may have to treat MBS differently from Treasury that any decisions regarding the tapering process are and potential market dislocation considerations and not by monetary policy concerns.  We don't want markets to confuse technical with changes in the stance of monetary policy.  Thank you, Madam Chair. On the other questions, I and predictable reduction in the balance sheet.  From the prefer to with this securities.  But we should communicate dictated by market-microstructure macroeconomic adjustments

as a brief clarification, because there have been some about our estimate of the size of the macroeconomic effects of these changes in two is.  For example, on the unemployment rate, it's 0.1 percentage point at its peak.  So after a couple of years, the 0.1 percentage point lower. MR. LAUBACH.  Perhaps just questions reinvestment strategies.  Beth's handout was only showing the comparison of the path for the federal funds rate.  For those of you who have the memo, on the third-to-last page, page 15, there is exhibit 2.  That shows you that, using the staff's methodology, the difference between the examples shown in the memo is effectively governed by the integral of the area between the two lines under the alternative paths for the SOMA holdings.  When you then go to page 15 of the memo, you see roughly what the effect of that roughly on the order of unemployment rate is about that President Lacker made beforehand-namely, in the federal funds rate so as to completely insulate.  So if with some path of the unemployment rate that you had previously determined to Now, again, the point applies principle, of course, you could adjust you started off

MR. POTTER.  So that's in FRB/US?

There are a lot of caveats concerning this, relies on the staff's methodology that the effects result being transmitted through term premiums as we I will readily admit that there is a lot of uncertainty about that.  But those are our MR. LAUBACH.  That obviously.  In particular, of course, it primarily from the stock of our holdings, and are estimate them. ballpark estimates.

DUDLEY.  And you have to also think of all the alternative paths you start to end your investments.  You sort of feel the ending decision is not easily reversed.  You're then forestalling all those paths where you higher for a much longer period of time, and that's not really in the model because the model is based on creating one path.  It's not based multiple potential outcomes. VICE CHAIRMAN that are foreclosed once reinvestments would've kept the balance sheet captured completely on creating

MR. LAUBACH.  That's correct.

MR. LACKER.  So this isn't pure balance sheet.

Correct. MR. LAUBACH.

the sizes that were relevant going into QE-the estimates MR. ROSENGREN.  And that that you're basing this on-are basically the same, roughly approximate size that you would have if you do it in reverse, is that right?

Correct. MR. LAUBACH.

Thank you. MR. ROSENGREN.

don't remember the chronology exactly, but the estimates of know what it was called back then-those were twice, is my recollection.  It is symmetric now, albeit smaller than what we told the MR. WILCOX.  And I efficacy that we started out with at QE1-I don't scaled back Committee at the dawn of large-scale asset purchases.

It's the same modeling approach, David.  The MBS is sort of put into MR. POTTER. that framework, and one of the uncertainties is on the MBS side because it's been harder for us to model that.

WILCOX.  Yes, but I think initially we were more optimistic about portfolio effects. MR.

MR. POTTER.  Oh, completely.

Much of that adjustment had to do with the difficulty of estimating how asset prices other response to the first Subsequently, we thought we observed somewhat smaller asset price responses like the stock scaled back. market and, therefore,

thing we could do is calibrate under those different responses so MR. POTTER.  So one you could see that.

There's too much uncertainty surrounding the manipulation to treat the normalization of the balance sheet in a way that To avoid the volatility associated with simply ceasing reinvestments, we can, for example-and as others have Treasury securities and reinvestments.

If housing finance remains difficult for certain groups of potential buyers, it is not the result of temporary liquidity problems but due to deliberate, nonmonetary regulatory and policy decisions.  Nor do we see a rationale for continuing purchases of sheet normalization commences, we are likely stability in view.  Accordingly, I favor as rapid an end to MBS reinvestments as is possible without disruption to housing finance.  Ending reinvestments

on themes that of what I will say are different from parts.  First, I think the balance sheet adjustment has will talk about that.  This is a little bit in answer Fischer.  Second, I think we should admit that it's a potent tool when we are returning the balance sheet to a more normal size.  Third, 'potent tool' naturally state this hasn't been emphasized as much-we have an existing policy expectation, which is that My conclusion is:  We should choose a is consistent with the existing expectation, but which is state dependent.  Let me MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have a view that picks up have been mentioned during the morning, but some aspects almost everybody.  My argument has four proven to be a potent monetary policy tool, so I to Governor thinking about means it needs to be managed carefully.  I think that means the adjustment should be dependent.  A lot of people are saying it should be state dependent here this morning.  Fourthand we will cease reinvestment six months after liftoff. policy that elaborate on these points.

I think the models are likely understating potential effects on markets and on the economy that could policy.  Also, the international evidence on balance sheet from the Bank of Japan's most recent efforts and, itself only involved changes in expectations of balance sheet by the Committee either at the Nevertheless, there were large of 100 basis points on longer-term interest rates. staff's come from changes in balance sheet policy suggests important effects coming certainly, the ECB's most recent efforts.

that this is a potent tool.  And I think we should be clearer that this Well, if you think they're small effects, then doesn't really matter when you normalize.  If you think they are big My first point, then, is is the case as we discuss this, because there is a lot of schizophrenia around the table.  Some people think, 'Oh, these are really small effects.' don't worry about it.  It effects, as Governor Fischer was saying, then you have to be a lot more careful about it.

expectations, then the effects is not that everything you do with a balance sheet causes big effects.  It is only expectation, which is what the taper tantrum was.  We should effects would interfere with our policy Second, I interpret the staff simulations to suggest that if we manage the balance sheet down in a way that does not differ materially from current market will be minor.  It if you deviate from the current expect small effects as long as we do something pretty consistent with existing expectations. There is the potential for the effects to be large, and large rate normalization.

talked about, we already have an existing balance sheet markets, which is that we will end reinvestment six months sheet decline appropriately.  At the same time, I interpret the Committee's policy to interfere with the policy rate you should to do this in such a way that you choose the optimal rate path, for an announced balance the implications for inflation and unemployment are exactly the same as And fourth, as Governor Fischer policy expectation built into financial after liftoff.  In my view, this policy is inappropriate.  It's too calendar based, and it does not smooth the balance sentiment to be that we do not wish balance sheet normalization process.  And I am sympathetic with President Lacker's comment that be able sheet policy, and that they would otherwise be.

is how we want to think about it:  We want to have primacy for our policy sheet policy into the be in response to unexpected changes in the from an announcement that we might make that this would interfere with the intended effects of the through interest rate I think that rate normalization process, and, therefore, we want to push balance background, which is fine.  And we do not want some type of tantrum, moving longer-term rates either higher or lower than they would otherwise Committee's balance sheet policy stemming would be forthcoming.  Such an outcome Committee's main policy normalization, which would be taking place increases.

is to devise a smooth statethis Committee to use to manage the balance sheet down to a lower level. economy continues to So, what's the bottom line?  The task for the staff, as I see it, dependent strategy for A simple version would be for the Committee to state that, provided the

July 28-29, 2015

Committee's intention is to smoothly reduce the size of the sheet by a fixed amount-let's say, $30 billion per month-at the appropriate time, but the step size may be reduced if negative economic shocks occur and may be increased if This would presumably be close to the current market make progress toward our goals, the balance that positive economic shocks occur. expectation and, therefore, would be unlikely to cause significant reaction in markets.

encountered, probably the first thing we'd do is I think you have to think about the ability to change the pace of 'managearound the table have said similar things.  As I see it, the just one possible approach, us one example to look at. Given the Committee's past choices, the decision to change the pace of the manage-down would not be likely.  But it would be an important option if a major shock were to be encountered.  And surely if a major shock were end reinvestment.  So down,' and I know several others 'manage-down' would allow to MBS run off.  The smoothing would be achieved by appropriately choosing Treasury securities purchases, sales, and reinvestment to achieve the given target, given the maturities on that particular month.  This is but it gives the balance sheet is a potent tool.  It should be managed smoothly and in a market expectations concerning is not derailed.  A simple way to achieve these in the balance sheet itself but to retain the option to change sheet reduction in response to economic conditions.  Thank you, Madam In summary, state-dependent way.

discussion that once we reduce the balance sheet in size, are big costs to reversing that reduction should really bear materially on our thinking about is that reducing the balance sheet, would be in place when we hit the that different from raising the effective lower bound itself.  If we hit the of accommodation in $3 trillion balance sheet, we have considerably place.  Another way to think about that is, we should be comfortable the balance sheet when we are comfortable with the idea of raising the effective lower useful and interesting.  I thought the there our policy in this space.  One way I am thinking about it because we are reducing the amount of accommodation that zero lower bound, is not zero lower bound with a $4 trillion balance sheet, we have a certain level place.  If we hit the zero lower bound with only a less accommodation in lowering bound.

concerns about zero lower bound even in the longer run.  I think that makes you think about what our should be.  I think we are sort of in this autopilot mode of balance sheet back to 2005.  That would be a Now, a couple of us-President Rosengren and I-have talked about our hitting the long-run goals for the balance sheet thinking, 'Boy, we should just get the size of the good thing, because 2005 was a really good time.'  On the other hand, 2005 was only three years before 2008.

MR. TARULLO.  And two before 2007.  [Laughter]

Thank you, Governor Tarullo.  That was helpful.  I our longlike.  If we are really averse in the longer term to the idea of ever the size of the balance sheet because of the institutional or political risks that others MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes. think we should be thinking more systematically and deliberately about what we want run balance sheet to look increasing have mentioned, I think that consideration really should shape our thinking about what that long-

July 28-29, 2015

thinking about when to say a couple of words about that in a minute. run balance sheet should be.  And I think it should also be shaping our initiate the phaseout of reinvestments.  I will up a little bit, but I'll try to emphasize it a little amount of accommodation associated with our balance sheet-the size and of our holdings.  So think it's important to be doing that in terms of how they affecting the size and composition of the balance sheet, not in terms of reinvestments per se. matters the most in terms of mortgage-backed securities.  Because they are and businesses becoming more pessimistic about the prospects for the economy, of of mortgage refinancing increasing.  As the mortgages underlying those our portfolio are prepaid, our balance sheet shrinks at a faster-than-expected rate. want to be careful in in terms of the flow of reinvestments, but rather in terms of how affecting the stock of holdings on the balance sheet. The other point-and this has come more-is that the duration of our holdings-is not shaped by the rate of change of the size when we think about reinvestments, I are This probably redemptions, we are delivering pro-cyclical variation in accommodation.  You can imagine households interest rates falling, and securities in So we are removing accommodation exactly when we need it.  I think we thinking about reinvestment not it is

points.  I think we should be thinking more about what our longin light of what I hear, which is a feeling of need to reformulate our reinvestment policy to serve our balance sheet policy.  That long-term earlier, really should not just be shaped by a desire to get back to normal the fact that we a very bad outcome occurred that mind that, as we go forward, we might want Those are my high-level term goal is in terms of the balance sheet, especially concern regarding, or aversion to, initiating a new asset purchase program.  And we carefully goal, as I hinted at times.  I think we should be taking into account we didn't anticipate, and we should be keeping in tools to deal with that kind of outcome.

I am not a rookie.  I like the idea of a state-based approach.  A lot of you about the challenges in communicating effectively about a state-based approach.  A tie the initiation of phaseouts or reinvestments funds rate.  So we could announce very soon that the phasing out of funds rate hits percent.  Now, I would disagree with some of the numbers I heard earlier.  I've heard percent for the target for the federal funds rate. what I said at the very beginning:  When would you be comfortable raising the you're comfortable with that prospect at myself would not be.  I would think we would want a higher target range for the of shrinking the size of I think the staff could be helpful on this by giving us some simulations that at 2 percent.  I think an analytical framework for the Committee to think through those matters. the evolution of phaseouts of Let me turn to the questions-though, having said that, I suspect I won't be answering the questions because have talked couple of people-I remember President Mester doing this, and I think First Vice President Holcomb also mentioned this-suggested that we to the path of the federal reinvestments will begin when the target range of the federal X what should X be?  Here people would be comfortable with numbers like 1 Remember effective lower bound for interest rates?  Maybe 1 percent.  I federal funds rate before we go through the relatively irreversible process the balance sheet. would show us a probability of hitting the zero lower bound if we are at 1 or that it could provide At that point, once we start, I would just announce that reinvestments would depend on the evolution of the economy.

as much as possible what the longis.  President Rosengren mentioned that the Conference of Financial Stability Committee went through a tabletop exercise in which two of us Now, if you go with my 2 percent target range for the federal funds rate, that actually gives the Committee quite a bit of time to work on the details of the phaseout strategy.  Before you do that, though, I think a key part of that work is to settle term vision for the balance sheet Presidents'

CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Powell.

July 28-29, 2015

MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I want to start by distinguishing between two is clearly a need to have a decent answer to the question of when end, and that need will ripen no later than the liftoff press conference. whole range of questions about the exact timing, whether at once or taper, whether we distinguish between Treasury securities and MBS, and is a complex or a simple one.  And most or all of that, I think-though we are thinking be for some time.  The way I think about this is that one of the purposes what will be said at the press conference, is to clear space and time to to proceed and give the Committee the information it needs to things.  First, there reinvestments will Second, there is the need to decide a we do it all whether the taper talking about it today, and it will go into the minutes and season people's -is not ready to be decided and won't of the first statement, allow the normalization process make those decisions when they need to be made.

to think that the Committee intends to wait somewhere in the months before ending reinvestments either through a taper or perhaps all at once. reasonable likelihood that we would taper over the course in the Committee's interest to harden those expectations in the near term.  I'll offer two Today the public seems range of 6 to 12 The primary dealer survey suggests a of a year.  Those are pretty reasonable parameters, they could be about right, but I don't see how it is reasons for caution.

the model shows only a very slight effect on rates from ending reinvestment. materially from those in the model.  And, as many have noted, I think that lesson-and shouldn't forget it-in the taper tantrum, when we sat around this don't know that there were more people who thought it would be seen as a tightening I will speak for myself-I certainly didn't see it as predicting the move that we saw in the model, and they can be very large First, Actual effects may differ we learned table, and I move or not. in the summer of 2013.  These signaling effects are not

I don't expect that there would be much of a reaction from a decision to taper, but I don't see any reason to take that risk unnecessarily.  The second reason to wait like purchases.

even a third reason that hasn't been talked about as much, and that is, the is going to be later than expected, and the pace I looked back:  The median interest rate forecast in the June at percent at year-end 2015 and 2½ percent at year-end and the lower is that in June 2014, the central tendency for 2015 economic growth was 3.0 to economic growth has weakened, other central banks around the world have cut their rates bound, and they seem likely to remain there for several years.  They've economic growth moves up significantly, we're very likely to be forced into a shallow which is risky but is still preferable to the alternative.  I don't want tightening to make that path any shallower, so it makes sense to me that balance tightening should slow down, just like the other pieces of the normalization process. I think there's situation has really changed since our earlier discussions on reinvestment.  Specifically, the normalization process has slowed down.  Liftoff of increases is going to be slower. 2014 SEP showed the policy rate 1⅛ 2016.  Current expectations are far below that.  Of course, the reason why liftoff is later path is 3.2 percent, compared with 1.8 to 2.0 percent in the June 2015 SEP.  What has happened is, as global to their effective lower also embarked on their own asset purchases.  And all of this is likely to limit significantly the speed with which we can depart from our own effective lower bound.  And unless and until global path for rate increases, balance sheet sheet to clarify the Committee's thinking on our focus for now is on the path of and give only a much more general statement of conditions for shrinking As a result, when it becomes appropriate reinvestment, I would recommend the Committee stress that the federal funds rate

I have no attraction to calendar-based any attraction to quantitative state-based guidance along the lines of the earlier. the balance would be, 'The Committee expects to begin the process of normalizing the balance sheet when it is reasonably confident that the policy normalization process is well established,' which is very much along the lines of what the Chair, I guidance, nor do I have thresholds that we used normalization process, I might prefer a phased-in might want to consider distinguishing between are going to be informed by events after until I see where the process is.

That policy framework has the virtue of being clear and familiar to as well as empirically well understood.  In contrast, we have to guide us on how reductions in the size of the the effective lower bound would translate into financial conditions.  For reason, while it is important to reduce the size of the balance sheet over time, I would not risked any sacrifice to the efficacy of our policy framework. MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

ceasing of reinvestments to be conditioned on economic developments few meetings spent informing the public that monetary policy will be area to be conditioned on the calendar. I would prefer the and based on quantitative rather than qualitative guidance.  There have been considerable time and effort over the past conditioned on economic developments.  As reinvestments are an important component of policy, it would be confusing for guidance in this more macroeconomic indicators would be, I think, and confusing vis-à-vis the macroeconomic framework we have set out for the to base reinvestment policy the Committee's view on all influence the outlook for the labor market and inflation.  In addition, maintains the focus on our primary policy tool, simplifying guarantees that changes in the IOER and the that are not coordinated simultaneously with changes in the the other tool. Quantitative guidance would be clearer and more informative than qualitative guidance. However, guidance based on one or problematic federal funds rate.  The simple solution that others have alluded to is on the federal funds rate, which parsimoniously summarizes macroeconomic factors that conditioning on the federal funds rate communications.  A further advantage is that it phaseout of reinvestments will be aligned with one another, minimizing any confusion that might arise from changes to one tool setting of

of the guidance to be provided, my preference would be for our that an initial reduction in reinvestments would likely occur only after 2 percent.  When rates get into that range, may be useful to pause changes to the IOER in order to gauge the effect on financial table, I place a high priority on minimizing the risk that adverse return to the zero lower bound.  Maintaining investments until Regarding the specifics communication to state the federal funds rate has reached a range around moreover, it conditions.  The preferred range would be motivated, in my thinking, by several factors.  First, like many others around this economic developments cause a

In particular, one risk that I would is the risk that longer-run rates way that complicates policy, as happened during the taper tantrum. ceasing or tapering until it becomes clear that the headwinds that have economic growth to quite moderate levels despite extremely accommodative monetary Now, as we've discussed, the model-based analysis suggests that delay premium and, through longer-term rates, on economic activity is likely to be quite Nonetheless, I'm concerned about the signaling effects of an early change in reinvestment policy, which could produce larger effects than we anticipate. want to keep in mind as we contemplate our reinvestment policy behave in an unexpected Thus, I prefer to wait on limited policy have subsided.

that agreeing to specific quantitative guidance may be difficult, and I'm open a time when the federal funds rate returns to more normal levels, or referring to the the zero lower bound, or simply referencing I think the difficulty, though, with any qualitative guidance is that market well interpret it as much sooner or later that we intend, and it will immediately Committee members to face ongoing efforts to get us to further elaborate what precisely mean by those qualitative conditions.

I might also be inclined to securities, although I In an abundance of caution, I would probably favor some phasing or tapering so as to avoid any possible apply the phaseout of reinvestments symmetrically to MBS and Treasury

Finally, I do favor communicating clearly our policy framework once these decisions have been the minutes, in order not to get ahead of the policymaking process.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

Thank you, and thanks to everyone for a very rich discussion.  I think about additional staff work that might be appropriate, and I think we will to summarize the discussion; I think this point.  But I do hear some congealing of views, and I think this has been a really useful discussion, and I CHAIR YELLEN. this has really been quite an interesting set of considerations we've discussed.

I titled 'Materials for Briefing on Potential Enhancements to the Summary of Economic Projections.' comments and then some graphics that correspond exactly to those included in the staff memo from the subcommittee addition of median projections, and the second would be the illustrate forecast uncertainty.  At this time, as I will detail, medians and one other change to a conclude with a brief review of staff As Governor Fischer indicated, and as the cover indicated, the subcommittee has identified two broad, promising enhancements to the SEP.  The first is the addition of fan charts to the subcommittee is recommending the addition of the SEP, which concerns the federal funds rate projections in figure 2.  The subcommittee intends to come back to the Committee later this year with recommendation regarding fan charts, and I will work on those fan charts.

SEP provide the full range and other central value, public tendencies as participants' collective view of the outlook.  Figure 2 of the SEP the 'dot plot' for the federal funds rate.  This dot plot does not report a makes some use of that median.  Finally, in the full SEP materials that meeting minutes, figure 3 all the macroeconomic variables and the federal funds rate. In their current form, table 1 and figure 1 of the the central tendencies for the macroeconomic variables that are included in the projections.  In the absence of a median or some commentary has tended to focus on the midpoints of the central measures of provides median projection, but it is pretty easy to identify the median projection, and public commentary are published three weeks later along with the FOMC provides histograms for And from those histograms, medians can be computed for each of those variables.

rationale for including medians in the SEP would be to improve the a more direct way, a measure of median is a more standard than the the central tendency that some of the public uses today.  Publishing the measure of the collective view would help illuminate that public use of that median in summarizing the The basic Committee's communications by providing, in participants' collective view of the outlook and appropriate policy.  The robust statistical measure of the center of a distribution.  It is midpoint of median as a summary collective view and would foster the Committee's projections.

the these materials, President Lacker has offered a suggestion that the to be helpful, and that would be the insertion of the word before 'appropriate' in three places:  In the memo line, instead of policy path,' and then The point of President Lacker's suggestion was to emphasize the cetera.  The subcommittee believes that President Lacker's medians, in the proposed in the case of each of the macroeconomic variables. To incorporate medians, the subcommittee recommends revising both table 1 and figure 1 of the SEP.  The proposed new table 1, which is shown on page 2 of the handout, adds columns that would provide the median projections.  It also includes the federal funds rate as a memo item and an expanded title that makes clear conditioning of the projections on participants' assessments of appropriate policy. Since we prepared subcommittee believes 'projected' 'appropriate policy path,' it would be 'projected appropriate the same 'projected appropriate' would appear in the first red sentence in the notes to the tables. endogeneity of policy-that there is a reaction function, and policy will respond as the outlook changes, et suggestion will be a useful change.  Finally, in terms of figure 1, which is shown on page 3 of the handout, thick red lines have been added to report the median projection medians minutes could also review the proposed addition rationale, along with a summary of the discussion that occurs today.  If favor adding the median, then over the intermeeting period, staff will The subcommittee recommends implementing these changes with the September 2015 SEP.  The minutes of the July meeting will report on the discussion of that we are about to have, and those and its participants develop and provide complete mockups of the full set of materials-including tables, charts, and text-that would be warranted by the addition of medians.

SEP the subcommittee is recommending today concerns current form on page 4 of the handout.  The top panel participants' views on the appropriate year of liftoff.  The panel provides the dot plot.  The start of normalization will make the top top panel at that been useful for recommends retaining it even after The other change to the figure 2, which is shown in its provides a histogram of bottom panel obsolete, and the subcommittee recommends removing that time.  The dot plot, on the other hand, in the bottom panel has communicating policy views in the period since policy has been constrained by the zero lower bound.  Looking ahead, the subcommittee believes the dot plot is likely to remain useful for communicating policy and we're well away from the effective lower bound.

subcommittee believes that adding fan charts to the SEP would help Finally, the communicate the considerable uncertainty that attends the Committee's projections.

There are them for that, as well as are very small ones, and because of that they pose little announcement risk.  But I do midpoint of the central sometimes a focal point in the discussion of the SEP.  And in lieu of actually is still one of my aspirational goals that I look forward about when it happens-I think the median is preferable to tendency midpoint.  Of course, we're going to have to be clear that the median is not I think the changes we're proposing for our September Summary of Economic Projections think they are an enhancement to the SEP.  As Todd said, right now the tendency is constructing a consensus forecast-which to telling my great-great-great nieces that central a consensus, but I think that's easily done.  And I think that would be a beneficial addition to the SEP.

Of course, regarding the top part of figure 2, as Todd said, when we lift off, it's irrelevant at that point, it's obsolete, and it should go.  But the dot plot, I think, has been proven to be a useful communications device.  Stepping back from it would be considered a step back in

One is about how we will characterize the medians SEP documentation.  The memo clearly recognizes that the new a consensus view, but the language 'collective view' is, I think, to use the phrase 'collective view.'  To my ear, at least, the this assessment of the or even potentially the I have a couple of minor comments. in the minutes and other medians don't represent potentially risky.  I would prefer not word 'collective' suggests the Committee has worked together to reach evolution of economic conditions, but, in fact, it's just a summary statistic of distinct perspectives.  I think 'the midpoint of the range of views,' 'midpoint,' word 'median' could be used instead.

have mixed views.  I agree completely that the SEP's range of is too often used inappropriately as an indicator of forecast risk, and so I think the to mitigate that confusion is good.  I do think the fan charts that are a sort of awkward hybrid of Committee views and external statistics.  For we are all asked when we submit our SEP responses:  Do you than in the past 20 years?  If many of us 'more' to that, then the fan chart itself is not reflective of that.  I don't have a strong view that could be made here.  I will just say a couple of things. that it may seem modest, but we want to be very careful taking any step like this, because hard, I think, to remove anything from the SEP.  And if fan charts are ultimately to be very clearly explained that these are just merely summaries of past data perspectives of the Committee at all.  But I do applaud the subcommittee for coming suggestions made for September, I In terms of fan charts, I projections idea of trying to use fan charts we propose example, I will note one thing that think that the range of uncertainty today is more or less said about this, and I understand the gains One is it would be added, I think it has and not the up with these enhancements and, particularly in terms of the am completely supportive.

SPF has a median that they publish.  And often the calculation we are doing is looking at the forecast median SPF.  So if you think about it that way, we treat the median SPF as a is no individual's forecast.  We calculate the error bands around that and it. MR. WILLIAMS.  Well, the Blue Chip is a consensus forecast.  The forecast errors of the forecast, even though it talk about forecast accuracy that way.  I mean, that's how we talk about

The one issue I've always had on these fan charts is on an unbiased average history or are conditioned on where VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. whether the fan charts are just based

At the subcommittee level, that has come up as something that the staff to have that kind of staff level. MR. CLARK. should look into.  For example, you might think of the unemployment rate:  If you are already at 5 percent, do you really think it can go to 3 percent?  You might want conditionality or asymmetry.  So that would be on the to-do list at the

DUDLEY.  I would favor a fan chart on that basis much more than that is unconditional with regard to where you are in the business cycle, because in the latter think you get answers that are not very sensible at times. VICE CHAIRMAN one case I

YELLEN.  Governor Fischer, did you want to add something? CHAIR

When we said there are technical problems, One has already been hinted at, which is that the SEP on whether you think the risk is up or down. is a technical problem.  The second problem relates to the question, how do you draw the fan all go out like that, and they take you out into the zero range. Those are technical issues which MR. FISCHER.  Yes, just a few things. there are two sets of technical problems. already includes a question to FOMC participants We are trying to figure out if we can get a graphical representation of that, so you can see why that charts for variables like the unemployment rate, which tend to have a lower bound, which is zero.  And typically these things So we've got to figure out a way of dealing with that as well. no doubt have a solution.

So that is how I got to think that maybe there hint about how I began to believe the width of these fan charts: regularly, up to 2007, that his fan charts were much too wide.  And then came the great financial crisis.  They is something to this widening out that you see.

As shown in panel we continue reflecting some unwinding of its very weak first-quarter performance.  Even with the rebound, we estimate that GDP growth over the first half of the year averaged only a subpar 1 percent at an annual rate.  During the second half of the year, and as in the June projection, we see the end of the medium term, the level of real GDP in our projection is slightly lower than in the June Tealbook, reflecting a stronger exchange value of the dollar and slower expected growth of also been broadly in line with our June labor rate also surprised us to the downside, leaving the The incoming labor market data have forecast.  Although the June unemployment rate-figuring into the second-quarter average shown in panel 2-was one-tenth lower than we had anticipated, the force participation employment-to-population ratio close to our previous projection.  Likewise, recent gains in private payrolls have come in about as expected.

in the GDP, all else being equal, risks associated with our unemployment rate forecast.  To better balance made some small adjustments to our supply-side assumptions. As we noted in the Tealbook, the combination of the June decline unemployment rate and the slightly weaker outlook for real would have left us showing no further reduction in the unemployment rate between last month and the end of 2017-an outcome that, in our view, would not have balanced the the risks, we unemployment point, to 5.1 percent.  We also trimmed our forecast for potential per year, and we did not let that latter adjustment In particular, we lowered our estimate of the natural rate of 0.1 percentage output growth 0.1 percentage point show through into our outlook for aggregate demand.  Taken together-and holding everything else equal-these two adjustments generate a forecast for the

One thing I would note, however, is there be softer than we've penciled in as our expectation for the underlying reality and will then be revised up in subsequent months.  Last year, for example, job gains in August were initially estimated at 142,000, a figure that subsequent two for August has been revised up 75,000 on average.

But then, after marathon all-night negotiations, Tsipras agreed to even stricter austerity measures than voters suddenly as they stopped, talks on the annoyances weekend-is traffic jams.  It's especially annoying when, for no apparent reason, traffic grinds to a halt, trudges over the next mile and a half at a glacial pace, and then, with no car crash or other distraction in sight, mysteriously speeds back up again.  We've had much the same feeling watching developments in Greece.  At the time of your been moving forward, albeit quite contentiously.

But of whether Greece's debacle may have weakened confidence resilience of the monetary union and rendered it more vulnerable to subsequent is reassuring that as their region's response to future crises.  Furthermore, the recent deterioration in situation has likely diminished its chances for its situation within the euro area. While the developments of the past outlook, they've had little effect on prospects for the euro area more generally.  As Simon has described, financial markets outside Greece were little affected.  And indicators of euro-area economic activity have generally pointed to continued recovery.  As shown in panel 2, we've marked down economic growth ¼ percentage point in the third quarter, but deep contraction on euro-area GDP.  Beyond the the forecast there remains a question in the disturbances.  The answer is not obvious.  On the one hand, it spillovers from the Greek turmoil were so muted.  On the other hand, the disorganization and disunity evidenced by European authorities, as well resistance to directly address the sustainability of Greece's debt, may bode poorly for the Greece's economic and financial normalizing

But here, too, the reveal any fundamental underlying weaknesses that we did not The downturn after the prior surge in stocks looks like a classic a bursting bubble.  Additionally, because of the relatively small weight of stock market in household wealth, corporate financing, and overall assets, we do not believe the correction will weigh heavily on China's future stock prices remain last year's levels, though this may, in part, reflect government actions to the market. In addition to Greece, of course, the panel 3-has attracted considerable sound and fury signified relatively little for our forecast.

Accordingly, it is crash could trigger a chain reaction of margin calls, fire and economic disruptions.  But that our baseline forecast, Chinese GDP the second quarter, moderates over declining potential output growth. To vulnerabilities, including weakened property markets, extremely high debt levels, and a shadow banking sector that possible that the stock market sales, and defaults that leads to broader financial does not strike us as the most likely scenario.  In growth, having bounced up to nearly 8 percent in the remainder of the forecast period, in line with

We downdrafts to be temporary.  In particular, output in Canada, in our foreign aggregate, was partly depressed by maintenance shutdowns in the energy sector.  And already, June PMIs foreign economic growth rebounding in the medium-term outlook is little changed.  However, indicators than we expected for many countries the first-half pothole may turn Although the recent developments in neither Greece nor China made a strong imprint on the outlook, the tone of foreign economic activity appears than we had previously assessed.  As emerging market the first quarter, but assumed growth would rebound in the second quarter.

As indicated in your next exhibit, at is a model composed of a number of equations for the main trade volumes based on movements in their fundamental drivers: U.S. GDP and real exchange rates.  They are econometrically estimated judgmental forecasts for several additional trade categories. The rise in the dollar since last summer has been an important factor weighing on the outlook for U.S. net exports and, thus, on economic activity.  Accordingly, I thought I'd spend a few minutes explaining how we devise our trade forecast and why we are predicting so much drag from the heart of our forecast categories of exports and imports of goods and services.  These equations explain the evolution of these foreign and using more than 35 years of quarterly data, and they are simulated using staff forecasts for the explanatory variables.  These model projections are then augmented by historical trends and line is that, based on our trade model, we assess that a 10 percent rise The bottom in the broad real dollar should lead to a deterioration in the contribution of net exports to U.S. GDP of 1.7 percent.  Importantly, our econometric estimates identify significant lags in the transmission of the dollar to U.S. trade, so this 1.7 percent drag takes place over a period of three years.

And the other thing I noticed in the loan guidance was put out, there doesn't seem to have been a nonbank sector.  I'm wondering whether perhaps banks aren't paying attention to the guidance.

What we did was break down the market a little bit into big loansmillion-and then what we call the middle market.  And for the large loans, less migration.

Thank you, Madam Chair.  I comment.  I find that these QS reports are very valuable.  We discuss Federal Reserve Bank of time.

discussions  last week, I was struck by the radar chart.  It's in the back of memo.  It's one of the cooler charts coming out of the Board these days.  But besides cool and knowing that it's called a radar chart, I wanted to actually ask on this.  In the text of the QS report, in your judgmental assessment of that it might be somewhat different from the part, but I just want to focus on the quantitative part for this purpose.  The radar for the financial sector, the nonfinancial sector, What's really striking about your assessment, both this time with regard to this discussion in the text, you go into the question I have for you is-if you were to roll back time and think 2006 when, in this radar chart, you show everything is dangerous, we should have known about to explode.  To what extent are there hidden aspects of vulnerabilities in our quantitative measures somehow don't see or don't capture and that, In our bank's your QS talking about how it's you for your perspective various parts of this, you actually comment quantitative chart basically breaks out financial stability risk and risk appetite/asset valuations. and for some time before this, is that the heightened risk assessments are all asset valuation/risk appetite, and there's essentially none on the quantitative side regarding the financial-sector vulnerability.  And, again, in the qualitative that in a little bit.  But about that things were the financial system that

July 28-29, 2015

a lot of shortlot of interconnectedness.'  I don't even think word 'interconnectedness' was in our vocabulary in 2006.  So I'm asking a serious question the real-time use of this versus the ex post description of things.  How much confidence do That last years later, when the thing blows up on you, you say, 'Oh, yes, sure.  There were term wholesale funding problems.  There was a the about you have that our financial sector has essentially no vulnerability on its own today? one was an easy one.

As you know, the radar chart uses time-series data-what you can capture might assign a level of vulnerability to the financial system a notch lower than we arefor asset values is as low as it's been. MS. LIANG. in quantitative data and what you ex post now go back and look at.  If we were to use just this, we which is, say, moderate, which is in the middle of the range-because, as you say, everything here except couple of reasons we don't.  There are things that I don't think you can think was too low before.  Right now we're double that, but is that structural that don't get captured in time-series data.  For example, a money market fund to capture here.  Perhaps we've addressed that one.  But transformation is a different risk that we're hearing about and evaluating and that you about is the off-balance-sheet really hard to see.  Derivatives markets have changed a lot since the 1980s, haven't been able to capture that in this yet.  Those are a couple of the reasons why take this and say this is our assessment.  But it's useful because it does force There are a capture in time-series data, so we apply judgment.  One is bank leveraging, for example.  I with hindsight we know that capital enough?  We don't really know, so we're withholding judgment on it.  There are also issues vulnerability to runs is very difficult liquidity can't capture here.  And the one that I probably worry most leverage, which is and we just we wouldn't just

July 28-29, 2015

where are you relative to, say, the 1980s?  If you didn't see structural you to think about, well, problems or missing data problems, you might just be able to use this.

If I may follow up:  I've lived through the 2000s.  We all have.  We construct these in 2006-but even on the chart.  And so I worry that there are things that aren't on the today that are really the biggest dangers.  When I look at something that says it's all clear, I like it's because we're not looking, somehow, at the things that just aren't on the radar, if quip, I'm going to end. MR. WILLIAMS. lived through these various bubbles, and if you were to do a real-time, Orphanides-esque exercise about these quantitative measures-and I know you didn't if you went back and looked at the memos and the analysis that was done, I'm guessing that a lot of these things weren't chart feel you will.  And with that

Nellie and her office do though, I think-Nellie, where leverage, funding vulnerability, or both rising at rates that are much larger than historical averages.  And then they is the end result of all their analysis.  So I think, President all factor into those gross answers. that they, and lot of others who are trying to make it their business to identify stability problems in advance are now using to begin the analytics that they engaged in. MR. TARULLO.  But a lot of what correct me if I'm wrong-is to go in and look at are rising, particularly dig into those.  What you see Williams, part of what you're getting in that radar chart is the gross conclusion based on a lot of more discrete inquiries they're doing along the way that Now, there's no guarantee that they or we or anybody else are picking up on every one of those hidden vulnerabilities you see, but I think there's some sort of filtering concepts the people at OFR, and a financial Is that fair?

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lockhart.

Chair.  A question for Steve Kamin, to interpret exchange rate sensitivity of net exports and their effect on real GDP a little more than a year would have made was that a significant amount of with Mexico and Canada, a back-and-forth, supply chain sort of trade, not necessarily sensitive to an exchange rate.  Another big piece of it is agricultural that into markets that are dollar denominated.  Mining is also conceivably in that category.  And So I would have guessed then that we didn't movements, or less than some other countries. a pretty significant effect on economic growth for a 10 percent more?  When you step back, what have you MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam your explanation of the growth a little bit in a grander way.  When the dollar began to appreciate ago, a back-of-the-envelope guesstimate that I our trade is cross-border which is sells then airplane orders are placed well in advance. have an economy very sensitive to exchange rate And yet, in the first quarter, we saw net exports have a pretty significant effect, and your projection, I think, shows appreciation.  Could you just elaborate a little bit learned about the U.S. economy from this process?

these twogoing back and forth, that, all else being equal, ought to diminish the of exchange rates, at least on gross trade flows.  It will not necessarily diminish their effect are going back and forth.  But all else being equal, MR. KAMIN.  I think you are entirely right that the more your trade involves way trades, with inputs effect on trade balance, because, again, these things

July 28-29, 2015

type, and the less of it is non-two-way trade in, for example, finished goods. you might expect some reduced effect of exchange rates on trade the more of your trade is of the two-way been very keen to try to ascertain whether our are basically estimated over a sample that goes back to the 1970s in now than they did before.  And the short answer is that we convinced that they are less applicable, though we are parsing some evidence that goes in look at the charts, looking at the years 2010 through 2014, it look like our model has gone tremendously awry.  But at the same time, it doesn't seem as well as in previous episodes.  Second, it is true that if you estimate our trade get particularly improved performance, in a this period.  And we think that a lot of so disrupted trade flows-it led to this huge that is at play.  So, we are alert to the possibility that the structure of trade has changed the dollar. Now, a couple things.  First, we have model estimates, which some cases, in some sense apply less are not different directions.  If you take a doesn't to be fitting models over some more recent samples-say, starting in 2000-then you do get somewhat smaller elasticities.  On the other hand, you don't robust sense, in tracking changes in the trade balance over what is going on is that the global financial crisis decline in trade, followed by very sharp rebounds, that our model couldn't capture-and part of what's over time, but we are not convinced we see enough of that in the data to merit reducing our elasticities of the response of trade to

the literature.  And I would note that, as a rule of thumb, to prices, if the price goes up 1 percent, the demand goes down 1 percent.  And Now, directly to that issue, our model embodies responses of exports and imports to changes in the dollar that are not particularly outsized, and broadly speaking are in the neighborhood of what you will find in macroeconomists often assume that trade responses, or any type of demand responses are of a unit elasticity.  So we often make those assumptions in our trade models, too.  In fact, our model incorporates

July 28-29, 2015

That implies a that is actually less than 1.  And on the import side, we have to a change in the dollar.  So the merits of further compressing those seem great.  You raise a question that we are definitely in the process of in are about right, but features such that when the dollar goes up 10 percent, exports fall by 7½ percent. responsiveness of trade to the dollar even smaller responses trade responses don't wrestling with.  For now, we think the trade responses that we have built we are certainly going to be looking into this further.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Fischer.

Wilcox.  You went it seemed MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  This is for David through page 1 of 2 very systematically, and I was waiting for the Beveridge curve, but to fall off the page.  Tell us what we see there and where it's going.

WASCHER. I'll take that question.  The chart shows that the Beveridge curve for shift out in the a decline in matching efficiency, and we had built that in.  One So what David was referring to was that Andrew Figura and David Ratner on in the Beveridge curve may not be increase in the natural rate of unemployment if it instead is due to a decline in labor share over the past MR. the JOLTS vacancy rate has shifted out.  Ordinarily one would think of a Beveridge curve as indicative of of the reasons we hadn't lowered our natural rate was because we were taking some signal from that, offsetting the downward pressure on the natural rate that arises from demographic changes in the labor force. our staff have put forward an argument that the outward shift reflective of an worker bargaining power, as perhaps evidenced by the decline in the decade or so.  In that case it is more profitable for firms to post a vacancy because the labor share is lower, and they get more of the profits from any additional employee.  And that would push up the equilibrium level of vacancies relative to any unemployment rate.

July 28-29, 2015

was trying to illustrate with the Beveridge curve. as consistent with a decline in an increase in the natural rate.  But maybe there is another story that leads That is roughly the story that David That it has shifted out.  Previously, we had interpreted that matching efficiency or us not to take as much signal from that outward shift.

MR. FISCHER.  Thank you.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman.

DUDLEY.  I wanted to follow up on the conversation that President the radar chart.  It seems to me that you are trying to assess financial-sector like legal risk, which has obviously gone up dramatically, or cyber risk, which has gone rise to the level that you would put that in the radar big risks that have emerged in the past few not a criticism.  I think that what you guys are VICE CHAIRMAN Williams started on vulnerability, and your ability to do that, though, is only as good as the metrics that you have on the right-hand side of the column.  So I wanted to ask a question on, how do you think about things up dramatically?  And when would that chart?  Because it seems like those are two really years that weren't significant before.  And this is doing is great.  It is state-of-the-art, as far as I am concerned.  But how do you think about something like that?

Behind this are a number of indicators-around 40.  First, cyber risk is not a financial vulnerability.  It is more of an operational risk, which Legal risk is on the border of that, but, in principle, you could catch that with bank the bank capital ratios.  Do you incorporate?  Are they holding capital sufficient for test, we try to this point.  And so, to the extent we can put that in here in a quantitative MS. LIANG. on here.  We think of that not as isn't on here. leverage or legal or operational risks?  And so on.  Things that we currently do in the stress capture some of that at

do so.  We don't have a time series on that, though, so my guess is, it's not well just a backstop, and we don't stop here. way, we captured in here, which is also why this is

Well, one way to get at this a little bit is, you have some stock market is at a multiple of book value, you have these big institutions that are still very depressed.  That might be something to think about. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. very large banks that are still selling at a discount, their book value.  And I find that interesting. In an environment in which the financial

MS. LIANG.  Yes.

WILCOX.  Can I offer just a brief bit of context on what this radar chart is?  And, little dialogue back and forth, and we'll get it straight two of us.  My understanding is that a rough way to see what is going on here is to radar chart as, in ever-so-rough terms, analogous to, say, the FRB/US or the EDO an algorithmic approach, which I think is used to inform what might be called the to the judgmental staff assessment of financial stability.  I think there were many staff rather to say, 'Okay, look, what could we do if we had a little bit of an expert indicators?  And let's just gain I think it's a little like the model with regard to the judgmental economic outlook. MR. Nellie, maybe you and I can have a between the think of this model.  It is analogue members who were very excited about putting this radar chart methodology together, but the exercise was not to supplant all of the judgment of the human beings that are involved in the QS process, but system, or a very algorithmic approach based on quantitative some real-time experience with how well or poorly that performs.' status of the FRB/US

FRB/US model, though, has a lot of structural modeling statistical.  Just to be clear, 'algorithm' covers a broad But that's exactly right. MS. LIANG.  Right.  The elements.  This, in contrast, is pretty range of approaches.

I wanted to ask, on the financialwrong on this-by the fact that term premiums premiums on housing relative to longeryou come down on the side of thinking about 'notable' as opposed to simply noting that term premiums remain MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam stability report, the valuation pressures are described as 'notable,' but a lot of that seems to be driven-and you can certainly correct me if I am are so low.  Risk premiums themselves don't seem that high.  And, in fact, you could make an argument that housing looks undervalued in some sense.  At least the risk look very high, if you were to try to look at where the price-to-rent ratios are term risk-free yields.  My question is, what made the valuation pressures being remarkably low?

When we say 'most asset valuation pressures,' we exclude residential MS. LIANG. housing.

So it has some of that.  In that In the CRE space, we are seeing the decline.  And we hear a lot of discussions bit more risk than they had been for a while. MS. LIANG.  I think in the corporate sector-commercial real estate-there are prices and yield bond sector.  In conjunction with that, we see the weakening of underwriting standards.  So it is And are they willing to give something up just to get an asset that is yielding them something a little higher?

obviously your report was read this time around.  And it is a follow-up to what Loretta asked about highly league tables for who is underwriting the highly leveraged large brokertables who is now much more significant on the tables for doing highly leveraged lending.  It isn't in a bank holding company, and it is I wonder how we think about how people are moving up and down tables for some of those markets that we think are critically important, and whether may be moving out of into the unregulated sector, particularly with a supervisor that may not be as MR. ROSENGREN.  I have a question for Nellie as well, so one that was well leveraged loans.  When we think about financial-stability risk, both amounts and distribution matter.  And when you look at the loans, there have been some dramatic changes.  And, specifically, there is a fairly dealer who didn't used to be on the league league supervised by the SEC.  So the league there is some way to also capture some of that concentration of risk that the regulated sector focused on financial stability.

want to make sure everybody is clear.  Very little of this stuff is balance sheet of regulated institutions.  What Nellie's charts are showing is the this stuff-but, Nellie, you have to help me here, because you haven't done a at this, that we have seen it as a financial what would happen to the real economy if there were an awful lot of bankruptcies, MR. TARULLO.  I just held on the originations of recent detailed briefing on this-most of which is being held by quite nonleveraged institutions. And so I actually don't think, as we have looked stability risk, as conventionally understood, so much as, instead, a potential macroprudential risk because of which then carried through into affecting the end investors.

The largest nonbank entity-which is an SEC-supervised brokerto the same entity-its shares have held constant between 4 percent.  Is that what you're referring to?  I still see the top 10 as being standard MS. LIANG.  Right.  I think the supervisory guidance and the lessons from 2008 are still fresh enough that for loans over dealer, I think, if we're referring around 3 and bank holding companies.

It's possible that others might participate is that the ability to provide some backup revolver the primary lead.  For middle-market loans, where a smaller and distribute it, then it's possible these kinds of firms can join. MS. LIANG.  Right.  It had a 4 percent share two quarters.  So it clearly is there as an alternative, and it hasn't really moved up the the past couple of years as much as we had tables that give the share more than they used to.  This is just one way to look at it.  So, for the large loans, where we are now, the way we've been thinking about it limits the ability for nonbanks to be fund could take it

YELLEN.  Okay.  We now have an opportunity for comments on financial to make CHAIR stability-not a full go-round-and I have two people who indicated they would like comments.  Let me start with President Rosengren.

it might be useful to give a Stability in Charlotte in June.  The purpose was to obtain a how the nexus of monetary policy and supervisory policy tools could be MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I thought brief discussion of the financial-stability tabletop exercise conducted by the Financial Committee of the Conference of Presidents better understanding of

July 28-29, 2015

scenario in which financial stability issues were emerging.  The exercise was based on that was was that the economy had attained both elements of the dual mandate and the economy to remain at full employment and 2 percent inflation in the absence of any changes as developments in financial markets.  The scenario also signs of emerging financial instability.  Specifically, the scenario included a rapid rise and increased risk-taking used in a the assumption that decisions were being made in 2017.  At that time, the scenario assumed was expected to our monetary policy stance.  The staff provided forecasts for both macroeconomic variables using Tealbook discussions as well included in real estate values, significant growth in the shadow banking sector, by non-SIFI financial intermediaries.

issues and time lags in many of the potential supervisory policy In part because of these governance complications and the lags in supervisory The discussion of the scenario and possible policy responses highlighted the important role of both governance responses. implementation, some committee members thought that monetary policy tools should be considered to address the concerns about future financial stability, even though doing so would result in a less optimal macroeconomic outcome.  Other members wanted to use supervisory tools and margin requirements but did not necessarily rule out using a monetary policy tool at some later point.

financial-stability problems and the the materials with Governors Fischer might be worthwhile considering such an exercise for the full Committee The exercise was useful in crystallizing potential complexity of responding to those problems.  I've shared and Tarullo and think it at some future date.  Thank you.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota. CHAIR

July 28-29, 2015

Chair.  Actually, my remarks will build staff.  With in mind, I think that this Committee, the FOMC, should begin to thinking about recording its stability conditions on an ongoing basis in the FOMC statement itself.  If there is a chance that, in the future, the FOMC will feel the need to adjust the stance monetary policy in response to financial-stability risks-and President Rosengren described contingency that the New York and Boston Reserve Bank staffs helped frame Financial Stability Committee that seemed to have that monetary policy in that I think it means that we have to, as a Committee, start to say something about how financial-stability contingencies on an ongoing basis. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam on President Rosengren's.  I was one of the members of the committee who did think that monetary policy might be a useful response to the situation that was crafted by the that assessment of financial we do think of the very plausible for the Conference of Presidents' feature-and if we think we're going to be adjusting the stance of context, then we're assessing

I think what it could look like is adding a sentence about stability conditions to paragraph 1.  One way to at least start that discussion would be to system vulnerabilities are Alternatively, and like the QS report, the new sentence could also mention that there a sentence today or 1 that would read, 'In second clause saying 'with notable vulnerabilities associated with This is just a one-sentence description of what we of financial stability risk.  I don't think we want moment when it turns out that financial system vulnerabilities are really high so So what would that look like? financial simply restate the QS report's assessment that overall financial moderate. are notable vulnerabilities in valuation pressures.  If we were to add such tomorrow in the FOMC statement, you would add a sentence to paragraph the Committee's assessment, financial system vulnerabilities were moderate.'  You could stop there, or you could add a valuation pressures in certain asset classes.' would be seeing in the financial system in terms to wait until the

July 28-29, 2015

to raise rates to start to record that in the FOMC statement.  I doubt that the with this in this meeting, but I certainly we're going Committee will feel comfortable going forward encourage building toward that kind of formulation in the statement itself.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

First, on the tabletop exercise, it was a a bit of disagreement.  So it shows there's a lot of nuance VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you. really good tabletop exercise because it wasn't obvious what the right policy solution was supposed to be, and people had quite here in terms of figuring out how to use monetary policy versus macroprudential tools.  That was really very useful.

talk a little bit about Puerto Rico, which is in our District.  The Tealbook had a thought was quite good.  I think this is likely to be a very messy process is no bankruptcy option currently available for the territory of Puerto Rico or for Puerto Rico officials are seeking, with the support of the Administration, company-or broad, which is what of the commonwealth's obligations. the precedent of providing this option.  Recall that U.S. states do not have the to file for bankruptcy protection, although municipalities in states do have that option. I want to box on it, which I because there its public corporations. legislation that would provide a Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing option.  This could either be narrow, which is what the Administration would support-in other words, it would just apply as a public corporation, such as PREPA, which is the government power the commonwealth would prefer, and that would apply to all But the hurdle to even getting the narrow Chapter 9 legislation is high because many lawmakers are reluctant to set right

9 legislation is not forthcoming, it seems to me that Puerto Rico authorities to be able to restructure their Puerto So if you assume that broad Chapter it's going to be very challenging for

this year or early 2016, there really is a risk will happen is hard to say. really considerable uncertainty about how long the liquidity resources of the government when the timing of this Rican debt on a voluntary basis before the territory hits the wall in terms of running out of financial resources.  This means that sometime later of a hard landing-you can think of it as our own Greece-with the potential of disruption to social services and even, potentially, social unrest.  When this There's and the Government Development Bank will last.  I don't really know might take place.

quite likely, I do agree with the Puerto Rico's problems are quite debt, while sizable, only represents already been marked down sharply in price.  So a good portion of the pain has been manifested in financial markets.  One other potential channel of contagion are the about $15 billion of Puerto Rican debt.  Their share prices sharply, and they would clearly be hurt further if there was actually an outright the role of the monoline insurers has diminished very the financial crisis.  Monolines currently wrap only about 5 percent of new Puerto insurers went out of business, shouldn't be disrupted to distinguish between the implications for the country and the implications for Puerto of like Europe. Now, while a bad outcome in Puerto Rico seems Tealbook's assessment that contagion risks seem to be low. unique and are already well known.  Puerto Rican municipal about 2 percent of the total tax-exempt market, and the bulk of the Puerto Rico outstanding munis have already monoline insurers, which guarantee have often fallen default.  The good news is that significantly since municipal bond issuance.  So the ability of states and localities to raise funding, even if Rico got into difficulty and the monoline unduly.  But this is something that could be very, very messy and difficult for Puerto Rico.  So you want Rico-sort

the current reading of 2.8 percent is up from last year, still relatively low by historical standards.  However, some analysts have cited the recent ECI as evidence that tightness in the labor market is starting to show through to the Some caution should be used for this interpretation.  When you disaggregate the data and the minimum wage in many states, it may be premature to place too much recent numbers as indicating tightness in the labor market. MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Many analysts have noted some improvement in the ECI recently.  While it's trend in the ECI. consider increases in emphasis on the improvement in labor markets from advisory contacts describe wage and compensation pressures as being primarily complaining of wage those due to legislated salary changes and those in hard-to-fill jobs.  In light responses from businesses in our region, it's been quite puzzling that the registered such outsized increases in New England. New England, like most of the country, has continued to see markets.  Four of the six New England states have unemployment rates below that of the national average.  That's why it's surprising that qualitative discussions of labor groups and regional isolated to difficult-to-fill positions, such as cybersecurity professionals.  Even with a low unemployment rate in most New England states, employers aren't pressures other than of the qualitative employment cost index has recently

Data released in the past few underscore the transitory nature of the measured first-quarter economy is on a solid growth path.  Looking forward, I expect real GDP growth to average about 2½ percent for the remainder of the year before slowing to a more sustainable pace next year. With growth above trend, I expect continued progress in closing output and unemployment gaps and in moving inflation back to our

measure, have steadily declined.  At the same time, job vacancies and of job availability have improved substantially.  And quits, a barometer of the workers have in the labor market, are only a tad above pre-recession levels. The ongoing improvement in economic conditions means that we're very near to achieving our employment objective.  The question is, how close are we?  Labor market conditions have unequivocally improved.  Job growth is averaging more than 200,000 jobs per month so far this year, well above the roughly 100,000 per month that we need to keep up with trend labor force growth.  Consequently, unemployment and other measures of labor utilization, such as the broader U-6 perceptions confidence hire workers-and that's not just high-tech workers, but also those jobs in sectors like construction.  I'm also hearing about retaining workers.  For example, a large trucking firm in my District reports The improvement in the labor market data is echoed by my contacts.  They tell me it's getting more difficult to needed to fill medium- and lower-skilled concerns unusually high voluntary turnover-up to 100 percent annually.

indicators are still lagging behind, including involuntary participation.  But, as I have reported previously, it's clear that reflects longer-standing changes in demographics and labor market that are beyond the reach of monetary policy.  Wage growth is another lags until unemployment draws nearer to its natural rate.  Consistent with labor compensation.  And like the expect further acceleration as the labor market tightens further.

By contrast, the progress in our inflation objective has been less our preferred measure still running well below target.

remain well anchored, and I expect additional firming price declines and the dollar prices has moved pipeline, so to speak, and very recent additional declines in oil prices reflecting renewed Iranian oil exports should only temporarily depress inflation. Longer-run inflation expectations of price inflation with increased activity and further tightening of the labor market.  Moreover, the key factors depressing current inflation-namely, the oil appreciation-are transitory.  Much of the effect of last year's drop in oil through the optimism about the dollar appreciation, which has been sizable over the past year and dollar appreciation has a considerable but transitory effect on inflation. is that a 10 percent rise in the dollar knocks about in the first year.  This effect alone explains much of the been seeing of late.  Importantly, though, this effect quickly A bigger concern is may well continue.

District contacts has not changed appreciably from our reports of tight labor market conditions have significantly reduced the percentage of crops in reduced expectations for the national average, District home prices are nation as a whole. MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The Eighth District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.  News from previous meeting in most dimensions.  Anecdotal become commonplace.  A very wet spring has good condition.  Declining commodity price prospects generally have farm income for 2015.  Unemployment in District MSAs is exactly at according to the most recent reading.  Housing markets seem stable, and rising but are not as volatile as in the my comments on the national economy and, in particular, unemployment forecast as somewhat forecast as, at certain points, based on I'm going to spend the bulk of on the unemployment forecast.  I continue to see the staff's out of sync with more mainstream views.  I see the staff's

July 28-29, 2015

forecast path for forecasts, as described by the Blue Chip as of higher than privatethe Blue Chip.  The staff's forecast of unemployment falls to lower than today over the next percentage point lower than today a more stretched interpretation of certain aspects of the data than I think is wise to use as a basis for U.S. monetary policy.  Pages 2 and 3 of Tealbook A show that the staff's real GDP tends to be lower than private-sector July 10, 2015.  Similarly, the staff forecast for unemployment tends to be sector forecasts, as described by 5.2 percent by the end of 2016-just 0.1 percentage point 18 months-and to 5.1 percent by the end of 2017-just 0.2 over the next 2½ years.

I do not see this as a credible forecast, taking into account the more likely to to fall further, and that this should be part of the baseline case for this Committee.  One idea that unemployment will fall further comes from the historical series rate fell to below 4 percent in the late fell to the middle of the 4 percent range in the 2000s.  In view of the low interest rate to likely I have said before that declines in unemployment in the recent past.  My view is that unemployment is continue piece of support for the given on page 15 of Tealbook A.  The unemployment 1990s; it environment that's anticipated over the next few years, and barring an adverse shock, the historical experience of the most recent two expansions is, I think, the best guide developments in the next few years.

ratio of payroll employment to Current Population Survey employment is rising, and, two, that the labor force participation rate will return to line.  I do not think these are good baseline assumptions.  The ratio of payroll has risen recently, but it did not rise during the 2002-07 The labor force participation trend Page 20 of Tealbook A contains alternative scenarios for unemployment.  Key assumptions are, one, that the measures of an estimated trend employment to CPS employment expansion.  It has moved up but may or may not rise further.

This would likely suggest less future labor force participation rate. is on page 29 of Tealbook A.  This is, indeed, an unusual trend line with the data over the past five years.  The trend is, in fact, everywhere above the data.  This strikes me as a stretched interpretation of the participation data.  A more reasonable interpretation would accept the other words, the trend line would run through the improvement in the would be without these over the forecast horizon.  Changing both assumptions likely sends the rate below 4 percent over the forecast horizon.  Some version of these alternative private-sector forecasts.  An additional consideration in my mind level in decades and that, lower than in historical The Tealbook also provides what the unemployment forecast assumptions.  On page 20, changing either assumption would send the unemployment rate below 4½ percent unemployment scenarios would provide a better benchmark case for this Committee, in my view, and would be more consistent with available is that weekly initial unemployment insurance claims are at the lowest indeed, if one adjusts for the size of the labor force, the claims are even experience.

2014 end-of-year unemployment and 2015 end-of-year unemployment estimates made in 2012 and 2013 and have declined more or less that time.  In other words, the staff unemployment rate forecasts have growth forecasts also being too high over this period.  One would have growth would have made the unemployment forecast more nearly the forecast unemployment rates are still too high. Finally, Tealbook A also provides a past evolution of the forecast on page 33.  The forecast for were initially high when they were continuously since consistently been too high-too pessimistic about unemployment improvement.  Importantly, this is despite real GDP expected that the slower correct, but

July 28-29, 2015

my forecast and the model, there would be more 0.3 percentage point from that This is all my way of explaining some of the differences between staff forecast.  One implication would be that, using only the staff upward pressure on inflation than is suggested in the baseline forecast.  On this, I would note that the Blue Chip CPI forecast for 2016 is 2.3 percent.  If we subtract to translate it into PCE inflation, then headline inflation is projected to be at target by privatesector forecasters by the end of next year.  This strikes me as a reasonable expectation.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

you, Madam Chair.  Before I talk about what I that have been brought up in MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank prepared for these remarks, I wanted to touch on some of the issues others' interventions.

I just wanted to clarify correct that we don't see the very low growth rate in the first quarter-of near zero, below zero, or maybe we'll see the revisions later that will push it a little bit above zero-carried forward into the second quarter, third that 'transitoriness' are actually stories that you would not expect to show level of GDP.  On the other hand, the low growth that we saw in the first quarter is distinctly lower levels of GDP at the end of the year than at least I had We're not I think when we use the word 'transitory,' actually lead to a permanently has that There is a lot of discussion about a 'transitory first quarter,' and the meaning of that.  In growth rate terms, it's that we saw this week quarter, or fourth quarter.  Rather, we see more robust growth in those quarters.  But many of the stories with regard to up in the actually translating into anticipated going into the year.  We're not seeing a 3 percent growth rate overall. seeing catch-up in the second and third quarters.  So the stories we tell for that transitoriness should be stories that lower level of GDP going forward to the end of 2015.  The seasonal adjustment story

July 28-29, 2015

port strikes and others, seem much more flavor, but some of the other stories, such as the challenging along those lines.

the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's analysis of the SPF, about how some of the is from losing the inflation nutters-those forecasting the 3 percent and is actually a challenge for us.  If you have folks in the are betting on inflation being above 3 percent, that helps keep the real interest rate the economy.  If those folks are exiting the market-are not betting that to drive up the real interest rate and push down I haven't voiced publicly yet, that Allan past five years, because the actually a very positive force for in light of the fact that we're not able to drive nominal interest rates lower. For the second issue that came up, I was very interested to hear from President George about decline in the forecast above.  Losing those forces in the market market that low and helps stimulate inflation is going to be high-that actually serves stimulus, as long as we're keeping the nominal rates the same, or the expectations of nominal rates the same.  This is in line with the idea, which Meltzer was actually one of the big forces for accommodation in the idea that inflation was going to be high in the years ahead was this Committee,

WILLIAMS. Was that a beta test of that argument? MR.

Maybe a gamma test. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  It was a beta test, yes.  [Laughter]

Well, Allan says people don't always understand nominal versus real, and that people understand nominal versus real. MR. EVANS. this argument demands about local economic conditions in the Ninth District, then I'll talk about of the inflation MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Let me turn to a discussion of what I prepared.  Madam Chair, I'll first talk international risks, and I'll close by presenting what I see as a key feature outlook.

metrics, the Ninth District labor market looks very strong.  The unemployment 4 percent in the Ninth District.  Indeed, the four states that are located entirely 4 percent.  Yet other metrics suggest the labor market recovery is not yet complete in Thus, on average over the past 12 months, the fraction of people aged 25 to more than 2 percentage points below its average over the past year, the fraction of Minnesota, the full range of labor market metrics-the unemployment the PTER, and the 25-to-54 EPOP-have all come back to 2007 levels. By some rate has fallen to in the District-Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota-all have unemployment rates below the Ninth District. 54 in the Dakotas and Montana who have a job remains 2007 level.  And the fraction of those aged 16 and over who work part time for economic reasons remains high in Montana and South Dakota.  But yet, in Minnesota, the metrics are consistent with a more complete labor market recovery.  On people aged 25 to 54 who have a job has returned to its 2007 level.  The fraction of people over the age of 16 who are working part time but would like a full-time job has fallen back to its 2007 level.  So if you look at rate, labor market metrics, however, inflation is not unduly high in in the are little signs of inflationary pressures, even in that, in 2014, the inflation rate for services was essentially the I think Minnesota's experience gives some Despite these strong Minnesota.

the Ninth District front.  Let me turn to international risks, where I see two key alternative scenarios regarding recent developments in China global demand and in global That's on risks.  One is well captured by the in which adverse international events cause a deterioration in

July 28-29, 2015

market conditions.  The result is that inflation in the United States remains below target time than in the baseline, which enhances the risk that inflation expectations will slide downward further.  One way to mitigate these risks alternative scenario does not consider is to delay the date of liftoff beyond the September of liftoff beyond that considered in the alternative scenarios, taking on insurance against these eventualities. financial for an even more extended period of longer-term that the 2015 meeting.  By delaying the date the Committee would essentially be risk is associated with our own actions regarding the stance of monetary policy.  There is a risk that interest rate increases, especially in the absence of any conditions abroad In that case, we could well see large capital outflows three different First, they could create global financial instabilities that would be problematic.  Second, forced to tighten their own monetary policies in order to keep control, which would then push the demand for U.S. goods down overall:  One is associated The second international U.S. obvious inflationary pressures, could lead to rapid changes in financial market that could then feed back domestically. from the EMEs and Europe as investors seek to take advantage of higher U.S. interest rates. These outflows could have adverse consequences for the U.S. economy in at least ways. the dollar could rise rapidly, creating downward pressures on the demand for U.S. goods.  And, third, the EMEs could feel domestic inflation under further.  Thus, on the international front, I think there are two risks with exogenous events, and the other is more endogenous to our own actions.

me turn to an assessment of the national inflation outlook, although, I have to meeting, Madam Chair.  Under inflation will return to target only in Tealbook A is actually considerably more accommodative than most recent median S&amp;P forecast, which raises serious concerns that the Finally, let say, not much has changed in this dimension from our previous the policy stance of Tealbook A, the Board staff projects that after 2020.  The policy stance what's described in the

That would translate to inflation will be in 2020 based on the zero-coupon inflation swaps, is still percent in PCE terms.  Madam Chair, the modal inflation outlook strongly the need for further accommodation.  Here I'm sneaking into policy. As I've suggested before, I think there are good reasons to put a lot of weight on the market-based forecasts of inflation as guides what's implied by the Board staff's outlook.  Zero-coupon inflation swaps imply a CPI inflation rate of 1.7 percent over something on the order of 1.3 to 1.4 percent in PCE terms.

Chair.  My views haven't changed they in the second half of the year, with the risks about trajectory. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam much since the June meeting, and they don't differ very much from the Tealbook's forecast. With respect to economic growth, I think there are both positives and negatives.  Together add up to perhaps a 2 percent growth rate balanced around that

I see to employment growth and the easing of lending standards for residential mortgages in the latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices.  Housing is economy-unlike motor vehicle sales, for example-that one can argue is still I'd put Household spending should be well rate that is income.  And the Iranian deal, if it holds, increases the likelihood that oil stay low for several positives with respect to housing, including the relatively low level of housing starts relative evident a part of the cyclically depressed.

trade to remain a drag and inventory investment to the fact that inventory accumulation rates during the first half of the year were quite few monetary policy part here-then I think the case for liftoff will be quite compelling.  But I am reluctant to count on those chickens On the negative side, I would expect fall, given high.  The biggest risk in my mind, though, remains the employment trend, which has been very sturdy relative to the pace of economic growth.  If that trend stays intact over the next months-I'm going to speak on the monetary policy just yet.

I continue to become less worried that inflation will remain 2 percent.  This reflects several factors.  First, the trend of core inflation has damping effect of lower oil prices and a firmer dollar-influences that transitory.  Second, a tighter labor market is likely to translate soon into I know that the linkage between wages and inflation is very does matter in terms of affecting the inflation With respect to inflation, persistently below flattened out despite the will likely prove to be higher compensation trends.  While tenuous, I still believe that pressure on resources

I do have one nitpick with the Tealbook-as I said, I mostly agree with it.  But period,' goes on to say that 'some of these measures seem to really new information. anchored.'  Well, I'm not sure I share this viewa bit here, I think-because the size of these changes is not It's on the order of 15 to 25 basis points.  And as Loretta pointed out, the University measure tends to get bounced around by the trajectory of oil prices.  So some of the you see in the University of Michigan measure may just reflect the oil price trends. as President Mester also pointed out, some measures of consumer inflation Federal Reserve Bank of New expected inflation at the time horizons in recent months.  The one-year median expected inflation basis points since April, to 3 percent.  And the three-year median expected rate has risen 8 basis points since March, to 3 percent as well.  Now, I wouldn't large, either.  But I think it does push against risk to the downside in terms of really support that conclusion. Now, Tealbook A, after noting on page 19 that 'readings on longer-term inflation expectations have changed little over the intermeeting have edged down during the past handful of years.'  Now, that's not These developments, Tealbook A continues, 'suggest a downside risk to our maintained assumption that expectations will remain well and I'm channeling President Mester that large. of Michigan decline that Moreover, expectations have moved higher recently.  For example, the York's Survey of Consumer Expectations has shown a clear uptick in one-year and three-year rate has risen 27 inflation overemphasize those increases.

Personal consumption expenditures more than 3 percent over the remainder of this year, while residential grow at more than 5 percent-a good rate, albeit lower than predicted six weeks ago. Nonresidential private investment is expected more rapidly than expected in the June Tealbook, although very recent declines in the price of oil may reduce investment relative to Government purchases for the second half well below the rate of growth of GDP.

At the June economy-especially in the labor market, where 260,000 in 2014-could be slowing.  That fear was exacerbated by the March increase employment of only about 120,000, a figure we alleviated by the second-quarter monthly rate of increase of employment of 220,000 and the staff's forecast monthly rate of increase of 210,000 for the second half of the year.

The whole purpose of what we're asking an independent, more or less coherent, picture of what they think is that's convincing, and not to try to I would that the Blue Chip is itself a median.  There are a bunch of people in the Blue Chip and a bunch of people in the Blue Chip who think interesting that one of the things that, as a whole, the seven years is what's going to happen So, again, while I agree or disagree with particular components of it, I think that it's that we encourage the staff to take an independent view. I have a couple of other to try to encourage the staff to continue to do their own economic forecast rather than to attempt to get them to do is to give us going on in the economy, which then allows us to see whether calibrate it so that the final numbers somehow align well with what others are saying. also point out who think unemployment is going to be higher unemployment is going to be lower.

of things that I had prepared to say.  On labor markets, as many commented, we've had continued improvement across most dimensions with the exception, I still think, of wages.  After an upward tick, average hourly earnings ticked they've been in for quite some up, but Eric already made the point I would have made-that the ECI, in a number as some of the other the inevitable seven- to eight-week effort to 'What can you say that's new?'-that I actually now believe that the story of wages in this Samuel Beckett.  This is not an overly literary crowd, I can tell. I appreciate that the Chair got it. I'll turn now to a couple people have notable back down again, so they're in the same 12-month range that time.  The ECI has gone in particular, incorporates incentive pay, which has actually been pretty significant of industries.  So it may not be as revealing of underlying wage trends measures.

But to be correct, I think they're a cautionary tale about be, based on historical correlations between accelerating wage increases in post-recession periods by Federal precisely because they turn out, perhaps, not reading too much into any effort to create such correlations.

That is a Fed Letter-it was just posted on the Federal Reserve Bank of the first, if my arithmetic is right-not always a foregone and persistent wage authors of that rate has been rising for lower end of its pre-crisis may be a little bit early to judge how well this correlation holds up in the present that paper was not actually trying to that One, which I believe hasn't been reduced to a paper yet but parts of the post-recession unemployment rate has declined recession high to its pre-recession trough.  The other, which is a little less numerically determinate, concludes Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Chicago's website.  With respect to conclusion-we've now already retraced more than 80 percent of the increase in unemployment from the pre-recession low to the recession high without noticeable acceleration.  And when I looked at the charts that were presented by the presentation, by the time that 70 to 80 percent had been reached, there was already a quite persistent and noticeable increase.  With respect to quits, while the quits some years now, it has only relatively recently gotten back into the range.  So it recovery.  If I read the paper right, President Evans, I think make a very firm numerical determination but was instead just trying to suggest directionally this is when you can begin to expect some acceleration of wages.

So we should remain open to the possibility, even the likelihood, that things won't been in the evidence in the data.  All of that, of course, is uncertainty about inflation.

What I've relatively optimistic view that China's growth will stabilize in China tend as a group Turning to international mentioned that carry some downside risk.  The first understand what is going on in China, and I certainly don't have very much confidence in my own assessment of the risks of a significant drop-off in noticed is that people who speak to Chinese officials or who analyze data tend to discount the stock market turmoil and take a around where it's now reported to be, whereas people who do business to be more pessimistic and view the overleveraged stock market as a harbinger of other problems.

because at FSB meetings, I talk to Chinese can readily identify cognitive biases in both groups, so I don't know whose story is that there isn't much upside risk in China So, while the risks it poses to global economic growth and, through the mechanism on inflation may be hard to quantify Being in neither group-I guess that's not true officials-I more convincing.  But what I think is relatively clear is these days. of reduced demand for commodities, to downward pressures

But against the backdrop of the Tealbook's stipulation of a increase, the Tealbook projection embeds the assumption that most think there are at least some to think otherwise.  The first, of course, is the fact that rates have been at the zero lower that haven't moved so much, even in response to the increasingly explicit rate rises that many have been announcing. On the dollar, the Tealbook already projects significant drags next four to six quarters explained in his introductory remarks.  Because the Tealbook also projects only a small additional projecting September federal funds rate of the capital investment shift associated with divergent monetary policies has already been priced into relative markets.  This may well be the case, but I reasons bound here for more than six and a half years.  So there may have developed more entrenchment of positions predictions of

This is of the world have outnumbered increases 44 to 4 since again, 2 in South Africa and 2 in Brazil.  So I wonder whether the buying on rumors and selling on the fact may not hold true here, and whether there may be the potential for greater cross-border capital flows if we increase rates before either economic or

What have we meeting?  I'm tempted to say, 'Not much,' in light of the paucity of new U.S. economic data in the intermeeting period. confidence in the trajectory of the economy.  Moreover, some of the near-term uncertainties on the international environment have materially diminished.  The labor market has continued to strengthen.  Payrolls dropped to 5.3 percent in June and now is 0.3 percentage point although some of that is probably due to the 0.3 percentage point participation rate labor market slack continues to diminish.

with the household of what's driving the baseline forecast of a significant a very important box, and I applaud its inclusion in the Tealbook.  As the box I have a comment on the box on pages 20-21 of Tealbook A.  The box, on employment and unemployment in the staff projection, describes a pro-cyclical relationship between the different measures of employment in the establishment survey as compared survey.  That difference is a big part slowdown in the pace of decline of U-3 in the household survey in the face of still-strong payroll growth.  So it's

July 28-29, 2015

more evidence that the stalling of GDP in the first quarter was in the first half came from the drop in oilfield indicates that the substantial drag from may have run its course.  Although the recent further decline in oil prices may spur a a pullback, I don't expect that it will be as extreme as what we've just been through. GDP forecast is seem to be at 2½ percent Wilcox noted earlier that that was principally due, we think, to net exports. real GDP growth forecast for this round, but I feel that, at a minimum, We also now have anomalous.  In addition, some of the real weakness investment, and the recent bottoming out in oil rig counts that sector bit more of So the second half should be stronger than the first.

Then you grade yourself in the back performance was.  I think there's a lot of value in that, and I thoughtfulness that goes into it. I want to stop there for a chosen, with some trepidation, to depart from the staff forecast on a couple of items.  I say that I appreciate not be too concerned about where the public of the book and show how the actual appreciate the last go-round in from developments in Greece and China, and those risks do seem much market correction.  Greece now seems to be headed toward One of the risks to economic growth that was frequently noted in the June was the disruptions lower now, as has been noted by many around the table.  There's been no important fallout to date from the ongoing Chinese stock

So it seems to me that the risks to our economy from international a new deal taken over the past several years in from contagion from developments have diminished materially since the June meeting.

expectation and reality of rates in the United States will cause the dollar to strengthen more than forecast, abroad.  Unfortunately, this risk An additional risk I mentioned earlier is the risk that the increasing policy causing a further decline in net exports as demand is shifted seems likely to be with us as long as global economic growth remains weak, and the sharp decline in commodity prices does suggest that that could be a while.

other half of our mandate:  The price and wage data clearly some challenges.  The staff estimates that total PCE inflation was only 0.2 percent for the Of course, headline The staff estimates that core indirect effects of energy and that underlying core inflation may be around 1.7 percent.  It me reasonable to expect, with some degree of confidence, that core and total factors are behind us.  However, in oil prices and the appreciation of the dollar will restrain inflation throughout lesser extent, next year, and that may present a real Turning to inflation, the present 12 months ending in June, and that core inflation was only 1¼ percent. inflation is being pulled down by oil prices, and that will end. inflation is also being held down about 40 basis points by the import prices.  That would suggest therefore seems to inflation will move back up to 1¾ percent once these temporary the recent decline the second half of this year and, to a much communications challenge throughout the fall as the Committee considers liftoff.

Consumption remains moderate, buoyed by strong fundamentals, but apparently not strong enough to overcome the continued drag on investment and production from earlier oil price declines and the persistent effects of a stronger exchange rate.

Even so, new orders for capital goods and measures of in investment spending over the second half of in oil prices are as yet unclear.  Meanwhile, continue percent over the middle of the year.  The recent data on housing starts and permits point to further gains in residential investment, but the rise in activity contribution to overall demand relatively modest.

The 12-month change in core PCE prices, for example, is have been 1¼ percent in June, while the 12-month change in the Federal Reserve trimmed mean was 1½ percent in May.

But, in view of the absence of any noticeable the reduction in resource slack over the past several years and the likely to be quite gradual.  Furthermore, movement downward.  This is if you look at market-based inflation expectations; we're also seeing that in survey As I mentioned earlier, we've seen a further leg down in crude oil prices and some the trade-weighted dollar.  There's also a fair risk that the downward pressure on due to dollar appreciation and falling commodity prices could stretch beyond this year.

my usual summary.  Today I'd just like to make a couple of comments of my own. to raise the funds rate target range in September.  So I thought I'd comment on what dispense with For me, the data flow during the intermeeting period will be critical in deciding whether it's appropriate I'll be looking for in judging whether our two liftoff conditions have been met.

clearly improved somewhat in the year when we set out as a condition for liftoff that we need to see further market.  Based on your comments, I think this view was pretty widely the time of our March meeting to measures of labor utilization has labor force is down a bit since the March meeting, and the employment-to-population ratio trend.  So the staff estimates that the cyclical of this ratio has narrowed modestly over the past four months.  Payroll gains have received since the March the recent pace is nonetheless healthy.  If it's maintained over the next few months, labor utilization.  Of course, not all of the labor JOLTS quits rate has moved sideways, and the hiring rate is to the data we had in hand back in March. Starting with the labor market, in my view, conditions have since earlier improvement in the labor shared.  The unemployment rate is down from 5.5 percent at 5.3 percent in the June report, and the improvement in broader been more noticeable, with U-6 down from 11 percent to 10½ percent now.  The participation rate is unchanged, but the sideways movement of the employment-to-population ratio represents an improvement on the underlying demographic component averaged almost 200,000 per month in the four labor market reports we meeting.  That's down considerably from the large gains seen, on average, over the previous 12 months, but that's consistent with a further modest rise in market indicators are better.  The actually down a bit relative are a this reading, in view of the fact that the pickup is The ECI released in April suggested a pickup in wage growth.  We've had a very interesting discussion around the table, and, of course, as President Rosengren noted, there lot of question marks about how to interpret

Even so, not every right direction for us to reasonably say that overall conditions labor market conditions index, prepared by the Board's staff, recent months. concentrated in the Northeast.  June's calls into question whether any pickup in wage gains is actually under indicator needs to move in the have improved.  In that regard, the has registered gains in issue is not whether there has been some improvement since March, but rather think waiting until we've seen some time of the September meeting.  For example, if monthly payroll gains in July and accompanied by a rise in labor force the cumulative improvement to be sufficient.  Of course, and the ECI would strengthen the case for me. The real whether there's been enough to justify liftoff.  Personally, I further improvement is advisable, but I also believe that we could have sufficient evidence in hand by the August come in around 200,000 or so, on average-perhaps participation-I would likely judge stronger readings on average hourly earnings

see such a limited amount of additional improvement as return us to full employment.  Like the staff and many of you, I believe that we still accomplished in the next couple of months.  We economic growth is sufficiently the normalization process before all slack in the economy has been eliminated. To be clear, I would not sufficient to have a ways to go beyond what is likely to be aren't that far off anymore, and, provided that the outlook for strong to support a continued tightening of the labor market, I wouldn't see a problem with starting economic growth requirement also bears on the other criterion we established for that will allow me to be reasonably confident that 2 percent over the next few years.  Inflation data over the past few months many of you noted, these the downward pressure on inflation stemming from the This liftoff.  So let me next turn to the conditions inflation will return to have been in line with staff projections and my own expectations.  As data serve to confirm our assessment that

July 28-29, 2015

fall in energy prices would prove to be temporary and indirectly support our effects of past dollar appreciation will also fade.  In the meantime, however, more, leading the staff to revise down its forecast for inflation will is likely to remain close to zero until early 2016.  And, as David showed, inflation may not be of much help either, as the staff projects the available on 12-month core PCE inflation to continue to run close to 1¼ percent through the huge earlier assessment that the oil prices have fallen some appreciably in the second half of the year and, especially, in the fourth quarter.  Thus, we face a communications challenge if we choose to lift off this year because headline PCE inflation on a 12-month basis referencing core readings December meeting.

projecting that inflation is heading back the basic nature of the inflation process.  Based on over the medium term and in an environment of full employment, provided that remain anchored at their pre-crisis level and we don't At liftoff, we will need to make a good case for to 2 percent.  To me, that case largely rests on the econometric evidence, I'm persuaded that something like the staff's inflation model provides a reasonable way to assess the outlook.  According to this model, inflation should move back up to 2 percent longer-run inflation expectations experience further significant price shocks.

make the an attractor to which inflation converges in the absence of offsetting pressures.  Of of these models may be true of any model.  I think the is not that we have complete confidence in our models, but Most of the more complicated, DSGE, models maintained around the System same prediction and for essentially the same reasons.  In these models, longer-run expectations serve as course, there's a lot we don't understand about the inflation process.  All wrong or incomplete in some important way, but that's appropriate standard to apply here rather that our models do a reasonably good job of explaining the historical data and are not

July 28-29, 2015

that current survey measures of longer-run inflation instead to roughly equivalent to saying that the natural We deal with such uncertainty by the stance of monetary market than we now anticipate.  As expect that, in response to incoming data, we'll find ourselves raising the federal funds Now, the staff's estimates suggest expectations are not, in fact, consistent with inflation converging not to 2 percent, but a modestly lower level.  If so, I would see that as rate of unemployment is somewhat lower than our current estimate, a possibility we always face due to the uncertain nature of our supply-side estimates. continually reassessing our estimates of the natural rate and adjusting policy accordingly.  So if the staff's analysis of the survey evidence is correct, we'll find that bringing inflation back to 2 percent requires a stronger labor a result, I rate somewhat more slowly over time than we now expect.

factor that I think is somewhat concerning is the decline in far-dated market-based measures of inflation compensation.  This decline, the past few months, calls into question the premise that the past seven years and thus the that inflation is headed back to pre-crisis levels.  Fortunately, staff analysis suggests that risk premiums rather expectations per se.  Accordingly, these data won't lead me to raise serious my inflation projection-particularly if they continue to drift back up toward renewed decline in inflation compensation would certainly give me pause. Like President Kocherlakota, a over the past year which has been partially reversed in longer-run inflation expectations have remained stable over forecast most of the decline probably represents a shift in liquidity and inflation than an actual fall in questions about their old level-but a incoming data suggesting that real GDP growth The most important factor affecting my confidence will be the outlook for economic growth and the labor market.

But if the prospects for were to weaken in the near term, then I will be reluctant to begin the normalization process even if the cumulative many of you noted, one recent favorable development for the outlook has been that a daunting sustainability.

We may also want to alternatives to the 'reasonably confident' language in our public statements, both at the uncertainty that we face.

will be referring to the handout MR. LAUBACH. 8   Thank you, Madam Chair.  I labeled 'Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.'

Under the range, the odds of liftoff in significant, probabilities that is roughly a 25 percent chance that it might begin only in March of next year or have changed little meeting. Your first exhibit reviews market participants' monetary policy their economic conditionality.  The top two panels plot for the timing of liftoff derived from federal funds rate futures quotes-on the leftand responses to the Desk's Survey also showed in his briefing.  Both show very low odds of policy firming at this meeting.  As Simon noted, some care needs to be federal funds futures quotes to control for market participants' assumptions about where in the target range the effective federal funds rate will assumption that it will trade in the middle of the September based on federal funds futures are 33 percent; they are 40 percent, on average, in the dealer survey.  Both show lower, but still policy normalization will begin in December, and, according to federal funds futures, there later.  As you can see from the dashed lines, investors' views since the time of the June FOMC

very close to vertical line, have fallen more noticeably below their estimates of the the SEP median. The next three panels shed some light on investors' views about the medium-term path for the federal funds rate as well as the economic forecasts that underlie these policy expectations.  As shown on the left, almost three-quarters of the primary dealers are anticipating that core PCE inflation during 2016 will be at or 2 percent.  The expectation of the median respondent, shown by the blue is close to that in the June SEP, shown by the black vertical line.  At the same time, as illustrated on the right, most dealers are anticipating that, by the end of next year, the unemployment rate will longer-run unemployment rate than was true for of the federal funds rate a substantial 2 percent labor markets to than the median June SEP respondent, the median dealer's the federal funds rate is identical to the median SEP dot at the end of at the end of 2017.  This slightly lower path than in the SEP stance or, alternatively, The dots in the bottom-left panel show the paths associated with these economic projections.  The dealers' expectation of tightening in resource utilization and of core inflation returning to close to in 2016 seems consistent with the fact that most of them expect policy normalization to begin in September.  But although the median dealer expects tighten somewhat faster projection of 2016 and slightly lower might reflect an expectation of a more accommodative policy a lower path of the equilibrium real interest rate.  As shown in the lower-right panel,

to the pace of tightening in the first being 100 basis points or less, and these expectations are essentially basis points per year, the primary dealers assign greater-than-even odds year after liftoff unchanged from June.  Averaging across the Desk's two surveys, the pace of tightening in the first two years following liftoff is about 100 conditioned on not returning to the zero lower bound.

While decomposing into term premiums and risk-adjusted expectations is their effective lower bound-staff between the OIS path can be explained by negative term premiums over the first Thus, the marginal investors in this market seem to anticipate a yet more of the federal funds rate over subsequent years than is embedded in controlling for differences in their economic outlook to the Returning to the lower-left panel, although the dealer survey traces an expected path for the from OIS quotes-the red line-runs substantially lower.  In part, this difference might reflect term premiums associated with the assets in states in which these risk-neutral expectations challenging-especially with short-term rates at estimates suggest that only a modest share of the discrepancy and the other two paths two years. gradual pace of policy rate increases.  In sum, while market participants seem to be prepared for the possibility of policy tightening at your next meeting, they expect a lower trajectory the SEP median, after extent we can.

As indicated in the bullets in B is intended to convey the the economy has been evolving in such a way that it raise the target range for the federal funds rate in sees additional progress toward maximum language of the statement would incoming data to avoid deliberately shifting the Turning to the draft statements for this meeting, the three alternatives offer a range of characterizations of current Committee's economic objectives and of the likelihood of policy tightening (or further policy tightening) at upcoming FOMC the top panel of your second exhibit, alternative Committee's assessment that could become appropriate to September, provided that the Committee employment and becomes reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium term.  However, the express sufficient dependence on the current probability distribution of the timing of liftoff toward September and to retain the option to defer the start of normalization.

the economy is again expanding in the labor market-one of your criteria for commencing in labor market conditions, paragraph 1 would note that the Committee sees labor as having moved closer to those that would be consistent with 'some' further market. The message of paragraph 1 would be that moderately, with solid job gains and declining unemployment providing evidence of continued improvement normalization.  To underscore the Committee's view of the importance of the cumulative progress 'underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year.' Paragraph 3 would provide an additional indication that market conditions policy normalization, saying that the Committee needs to see improvement in the labor

B would leave largely unchanged the Committee's previously stated inflation developments and would repeat that it move back to 2 percent to energy prices having stabilized.  The change would recognize that crude inflation from energy prices might not dissipate Alternative assessment of current and expected still needs to become reasonably confident that inflation will over the medium term.  However, the draft of paragraph 1 suggests dropping the reference oil prices have fallen back a bit over the intermeeting period, and it could be read as suggesting that the drag on headline as quickly as previously anticipated.

investors currently view September as the most likely dealers expect no to imply that a draft statement like alternative B would not elicit a noticeably.  However, as we noted in Tealbook B, if market interpret the insertion of 'some' in paragraph 3 as boosting the odds of a the target range for the federal funds rate in September, then interest could fall, and the dollar would likely appreciate. As I indicated earlier, meeting at which policy normalization will begin, and most material change to the forward guidance in today's postmeeting statement.  That would seem significant market reaction or shift the probabilities of the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate participants decision to raise rates might rise, equity prices and inflation that would indicate that the that would warrant expectations regarding the date of policy tightening noticeably later. that 'in light of economic and financial the Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic tilted to the downside.'  And it would indicate the that 'inflation could run substantially below the 2 percent to return to two years 'if inflation does not begin to rise As noted in the middle panel, the draft statement for alternative A would provide an assessment of labor market conditions Committee does not anticipate seeing, for some time, conditions the beginning of policy normalization.  Such a statement would likely shift the distribution of Paragraph 2 of alternative A would report developments abroad, activity and the labor market as Committee's concern objective for a protracted period.'  This concern would be emphasized by the introduction of a stronger inflation criterion for policy normalization in paragraph 3 and the addition of a commitment to use all of the Committee's tools inflation to 2 percent within one soon.'

More important, it introduces for your of other changes that you might make when you announce the outlook to indicate that it expects to to make 'appropriate adjustments in the stance of monetary policy.' would set the stage for additional increases in the target range for the and would add a sentence emphasizing the Committee's view that, this adjustment, the stance of policy remains highly accommodative and a strong economy.'

YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  To begin our go-round, I'd like to say just a public. CHAIR few words about our policy decision and, in particular, our communications with the appear to be evolving in a manner that will likely make it raise the target range for the federal funds rate sometime this year.  That was the has materially changed.  As was evident from my own remarks yesterday my own recent public communications, I believe that liftoff at our next meeting, This decision, however, remains dependent on the data between keeping our options open, on the one hand, and not taking other.  Depending on how the data evolve and, along with Economic conditions appropriate to message coming from the June SEP, and, based on what I heard during the economic go-round, I don't believe that view as well as from in September, is a distinct possibility. and their implications for the outlook.  Hence, in our communications, we face the challenge of striking the right balance markets completely by surprise, on the them, both our thinking and that of the markets, achieving this balance may be tricky, and our public communications between now and liftoff will be under enormous scrutiny.

July 28-29, 2015

policy on external is that every Committee participant has an obligation the public's understanding of monetary policy, including its rationale.  So I would ask We have explicitly adopted a data-dependent rates. In considering this challenge, I went back and reviewed our communications, and I'm pleased that it offers some clear and useful guidance for us.  In particular, the first principle of our policy to enhance you to try to keep this principle in mind at all times, but especially now, when there's such tremendous focus on the timing of liftoff. approach to policy, and we're not yet in a position to determine when we will raise exact timing of the first move, in my own view, not only deliberative process, but also can easily confuse markets and public, adding to volatility and, ultimately, diminishing the effectiveness and about the precise timing of the first move, be sure, mark the end of an But, based on the economics, liftoff arguably contains entire matters for financial conditions in the economy, not just the And the real issue we will face is how cautiously we raise rates after liftoff to the economy can really absorb higher interest rates, and that inflation is truly heading Opining in public on the detracts from our consensus-driven the general credibility of our policy.  In addition, the more we talk the more we stoke the media's attention on one particular change in interest rates.  To the initial increase in the federal funds rate will be noteworthy, as it will extraordinary period of near-zero rates. more symbolism than substance.  As I've emphasized in my public statements, it is the expected path of the policy rate that initial increase. ensure that back to 2 percent.

useful formulation when asked about liftoff is to say that no decisions meeting.  If pressed, three additional points SEP.  If economic conditions evolve as initial increase, policy will remain accommodative to support progress toward our dual And, finally, as I just noted, it is the overall path of the policy rate that is of greatest announcement of its decision.  So my suggestion for all of us is to refrain from speculating about the time of liftoff.  One have been made, the Committee remains focused on the data, and you look forward to discussing this decision with your colleagues at the next FOMC might be useful.  First, this can be seen from the June expected, most FOMC participants view a first move sometime this year as likely.  Second, even after the objectives. import for the economy and not simply the first move.

situation in which the Committee appears inclined to raise at our next meeting but markets, in the run-up, appear to be judging it as case, my inclination might be to make some widely available public comments nearI want to assure you that, before doing this, I would certainly consult thoughts and advice. Let me end by noting that it's conceivable to me that some type of communication may be warranted if we find ourselves in a the federal funds rate unlikely.  In that through some sort of event or interview to try to better align public expectations for our term deliberations.  But with you to hear your our go-round, and remind you that, in addition to your thoughts of alternative C for a meeting at which we first decide to raise the target Let me stop there, begin on today's policy decision, it would be very useful if you could also provide your views regarding the suitability range for the federal funds rate.  We're going to begin with President Kocherlakota.

Chair.  Before I begin, I was wondering if MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam I might have an opportunity to ask Thomas a question.

July 28-29, 2015

I'm sorry.  I apologize.  I should have allowed questions for CHAIR YELLEN.  Oh, Thomas. Let's do that.

Thanks.  I have a question about the addition of the word alternative B, paragraph 3.  I wasn't sure what that was supposed to connote beyond that labor markets have improved. represents maximum employment because of that what the word 'some' was supposed to connote beyond what was MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. 'some' in what was already in paragraph 1.  Paragraph 1 describes We're getting closer, presumably, to whatever progress.  So I'm not sure already in paragraph 1.

thinking is that it's not unambiguous that 'further market' has a fixed starting point.  It could be simply measured in further improvement from wherever you are today.  I think what the 'some' signifies is in fact, implicit in this a fixed starting point, which was when the Committee been traveled and only some of it MR. LAUBACH.  My personal improvement in the labor terms of simply that there is, first adopted this language, and that some of that distance has remains.  That's what it's intended to clarify.

Are there further questions for Thomas before we begin our goPresident Kocherlakota. CHAIR YELLEN. round?  [No response]

Chair, with the exception of a few the next decade.  I do not see this outcome as consistent with our commitment to keep 2 percent over the longer run.  How can we do better? MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you.  Madam months in late 2011 and early 2012, core PCE inflation has been below our adopted target of 2 percent for nearly seven years.  The outlook in Tealbook A is that it will not return to target until inflation at

The staff provides a clear answer to this question in the excellent optimal control simulations in Tealbook B, in which they put zero weight on unemployment falling below the

July 28-29, 2015

Basically, we can facilitate a more rapid return of inflation to target if we are not to living in an America in which the unemployment rate is below 5 percent for several So if we're willing to make policy rise to unemployment rates in the 4s for an extended period of time, then those inflation back to target in a much more timely fashion. natural rate. averse years.  Now, for those of us in the Ninth District, we can tell you it's not so bad to have unemployment below 5 percent.  We live with it all the time. choices that give policy choices will push liftoff later this year rather than waiting longer, as long as we raise the federal But I'm not convinced this 'go and super slowly' approach is the best one.  A key part of what makes these policies work is, the agents in the model know that the FOMC is not averse to having lifting off in, say, September would signal that clearly.  From this communications the in Tealbook B suggest, we would get pretty similar inflation and unemployment Now, the optimal control exercises also indicate that we could obtain those outcomes, even if we initiate funds rate very slowly, by about 10 basis points per quarter. early in the simulations unemployment below 5 percent.  In the real world, the public doesn't know that, and I don't believe that point of view, we would be much better off deferring liftoff until, say, the latter portion of next year and then raising the federal funds rate more rapidly than 10 basis points per quarter.  As footnotes outcomes by doing that-as long as assumptions in the model are met, of course.

Especially in light of the deferring liftoff until we am sure that some of you, perhaps many of you, are All of this is based on the modal outlook.  I talked yesterday about some of the downside risks-possibly adverse international expectations.  I thought sharpen the constraints imposed by the zero lower bound, these risks also support have a stronger inflation outlook.  I

The Committee meets eight times risks to stability that we're concerned about, we should be letting our staff know what other undoubtedly concerned about other risks:  a possibility that considerably steeper than what the staff has modeled, or that risks to financial stability low interest per year and gets plenty of advance warning for these particular outcomes.  We'll hear about and see inflationary pressures through the behavior of inflation itself and through our intelligencegathering efforts.  The QS report, through the diligent work of our staff, will reveal financial stability.  If we feel that the QS report is not designed to elicit the kinds of risks to financial information they should, in fact, be including in that report.

This the zero lower bound.

I'm not sure what message the If the Committee is attempting to deliver the message that 'live' in its thinking, the route you were describing whereby you were going While I'm recommending alternative A, I do have a comment about alternative B, which follows up on the question I paragraph 3.  I think that a good discipline on all if Committee is attempting to deliver. September is very

Between now meeting, we will have two employment reports and further evidence on are experiencing wage and price acceleration consistent with returning PCE inflation in the medium term.  While I'm reasonably confident that labor markets will to improve, particularly in light of the apparent waning of several important geopolitical I need to see more data to determine whether we are returning to our 2 percent target within a reasonable horizon.  Although the oil price decline and dollar since the end of last year are likely to be attenuating, recent movements in oil prices may be continuing to influence pricing inflation target.  I'd like to see a MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

The inflation returning to target, I could be persuaded that September was the time for can easily imagine that wage and price data will not be improving as hoped, The statement is data dependent, and I believe we confirmed the conditions we have set My own view is that, in September, core PCE inflation may be as likely to rise-not economy is approaching a point at which the Committee will confront a difficult decision at each meeting.  If labor markets continue to improve and the wage and price data show further evidence of liftoff.  However, I and that a later liftoff would be appropriate. should be open minded to reacting only when the data have out in our statement.

look increasingly favorable.  Most important, the labor market has may not be quite there yet, we are finally closing in on return to 2 percent.  Of course, with oil prices dropping again and the dollar having longer, but the experience over the will be transitory.  Between now and our next meeting, a released, and this I anticipate that it will be to raise the target funds rate at our September meeting. Economic conditions improved steadily this year.  Although we full employment.  And, while inflation remains low, the most recent data are consistent with a gradual edged up some, the return to 2 percent may be delayed a bit past year confirms that those effects deluge of data on wages, prices, spending, and labor market conditions will be counsels a bit more patience.  But, barring any major surprises, appropriate approach taken in alternative C.  It smooth transition from past statements, which focus on the conditions for liftoff, to on the likely path of policy normalization.  Again, I agree in which we will be trying to describe the future policy decisions.  But this statement to the next.  But I agree with your point about talking about future policy normalization. Looking ahead to that time, I support the overall provides a future statements, which will focus with President Rosengren.  I see this statement, maybe, as the bridge between the past and future statements is a transition statement to get us from one point the need for

our policy decisions in this statements of the future once we've raised rates.  First, In that regard, I have two comments on how we should frame post-liftoff era, thinking ahead to the

July 28-29, 2015

improvement in the labor market for rate hikes.  For example, the future to raise rates even if the labor market softens a bit assuming I'm talking about a situation in which the unemployment rate is than the change.  I guess that's just a sign terms of our employment mandate over the rest of this year. when we're nipping at the heels of full employment, we'll need to get away from language that implies that we need to see further it could well be appropriate in between meetings, around 5 percent.  Instead, future statement language should focus more, I think, on the overall strength of the labor market-that is, the level, rather of the success I'm foreseeing in language in alternative C could be interpreted in a rising rate environment.  Specifically, this and the unemployment below the perceived longer-run natural rate of unemployment, a scenario described yesterday, and a characterization of my own forecast.  Basically, a situation in which we are appropriately pushing unemployment below 5 percent-picking comments of President Kocherlakota, too-in order to bring inflation back to Second, I'm concerned about how the bracketed 'balanced approach' paragraph 4 of language may pose communication risks when inflation is below target rate is at or by the Chair in her comments it's up on the 2 percent, but inflation is still too low.

situations in which circumstances I'm considering here, it's unclear what trading off.  Does a low unemployment rate on its own require a restrictive This gaps, a simulation that features a more accommodative implied by the standard symmetric as President Kocherlakota just mentioned. As noted in our consensus statement, 'balanced approach' refers to we're trading off conflicting goals.  In the we are balancing or policy adjustment that would delay the attainment of our 2 percent inflation objective? issue is nicely illustrated by the Tealbook optimal control simulation using asymmetric weights on positive and negative unemployment policy stance and faster attainment of the inflation goal than quadratic loss function,

clear guidance on this issue.  Unquestionably, the of view.  However, the longer-run of unemployment-the unemployment rate consistent with constant inflation-can Economic theory does not provide unemployment rate can be too low from an efficiency point natural rate and likely does differ from the efficient, socially desirable level.

longer run, our inflation mandate implies that this tension must be resolved in favor our longer-run policy deliberations.  As President Kocherlakota has pointed out in and again today, we as a Committee haven't really discussed this issue at any In the of the natural rate of unemployment, and our consensus statement makes that point.  But this doesn't answer the shorter-run question of how to weigh deviations from employment goal in our previous meetings length, nor have we come to any definitive conclusion.

position on the current level of the natural rate of unemployment that the Chair relative to the longer-run natural rate.  I'm just highlighting an important because of the uncertainty about how best the high degree of uncertainty associated with the measures of trying to reach, I am wary of including the 'balanced approach' in alternative C.  Astute observers will take notice and may whether perceived excess monetary policy.  To avoid the potential for such an unforced error, in the tennis, I prefer the language that emphasizes 'economic conditions relative to' rather 'deviations from,' and prefer not to include the bracketed 'balanced approach' our future statements as described in alternative C.  Thank you. Now, to be clear, I'm not advocating a particular efficient level of unemployment or the short-term mentioned yesterday issue in terms of framing our policy communications to think about this.  Because of full employment that we're language in the way that is laid out raise sensitive and, ultimately, distracting questions about employment, which President Kocherlakota says seems to be quite pleasant, is resulting in a tighter setting for parlance of than the language in

in the federal funds rate the past year, and I expect that to continue.  Continued stabilization in some of the inflation measures make me reasonably I believe me today is that our statement not preclude September as an option for liftoff. MS. MESTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  In my view, the incoming data continue to indicate that the economy can support an increase of 25 basis points from today's very low, essentially zero, level.  Economic growth has strengthened, the labor market has improved notably over economic expansion and improvements in the labor market, the stability of longer-term inflation expectations, and recent confident that inflation will move back to our 2 percent objective over the medium run.  I do believe we need to be data dependent.  But, barring any significant negative surprises, the conditions we've indicated for liftoff will have been met by September.  What's important for we move further toward laying the that 2 percent over the medium run even if the current measures of inflation are is going to be key to that rationale.  Nonetheless, I believe the language Personally, I probably would have preferred that foundation for the rationale for liftoff.  As we discussed yesterday, conveying the points monetary policy needs to be forward looking, and that our inflation models project inflation to return to underrunning 2 percent, in alternative B keeps September alive, so I support it.

that paragraph 1 gives some indication of the longer-term gains we've seen labor market, rather than focusing solely on the developments over the intermeeting the labor and I agree I appreciate in the period.  In paragraph 3, I support adding the word 'some' to the liftoff conditions for market.  I think that's appropriate because it acknowledges the progress we've seen, with Thomas's explanation of the value of adding that word.

July 28-29, 2015

getting near, I believe it's appropriate that we consider the language we'll at the time, and I'm glad the Chair has asked us to comment specifically on language.  I do think this statement will also serve as a liftoff statement. 1 provides a longer-term perspective on economic developments, which is appropriate beyond.  As paragraph 3 does, it is important to that, even after this initial increase in the funds rate, policy will remain highly not only the addition of 'some' to said, but also the evolution of the statement in C. With liftoff want to use alternative C Paragraph in our statement, not only at liftoff but also remind the public accommodative and supportive of the economy.  I like paragraph 3 in alternative B, as I've already alternative inclusion of a language choice in this maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, rather because I think one of the issues the Committee has struggled with over numerical objective for our pricehave a numerical goal, and My initial thought about our saying in paragraph 4 that approach to pursuing objectives was that it was okay because this about some of the issues that President Williams raised with respect to using this in this I need to consider that further.  I agree that including that our path is anticipated to be gradual is appropriate.  We've been saying that, but I that it's data dependent would be helpful. In paragraph 4 of alternative C, I appreciate the version of the statement.  I have a strong preference for saying that we'll assess 'economic conditions relative to' our objectives of than 'deviations from,' the past few years is how to explain that, while we do have a stability objective, we do not have one for our maximum-employment objective.  I believe speaking about deviations might be misconstrued as implying that we this is the explanation that Thomas gave. we will take a balanced language is used in our Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy statement.  But I want to think statement at this particular time.  So language also think that adding the language

Or, as they say in might take the opportunity to stop burying the lede.  Thank you, Madam Chair. Finally, because of the scrutiny any when we can something being read into it.  Liftoff affords us the opportunity, because solely on our action.  So this might be a time to return to the decision the journalism, we

Thank you, Madam alternative this year' in the sentence on underutilization of labor resources.  I in discussing progress and conveys that the Committee be unduly influenced hope this small change in wording will be seen as a slight foreshadowing of a Although these messages are subtle, I think the statement I see paragraph 1 as a good characterization of the state of the economy.  I like the effect of the phrase 'since early think it appropriately widens the aperture is considering and giving weight to accumulated gains, and that it will not by one month's data, if they are disappointing.

Yesterday, I was part of the group that explicitly putting balance sheet policy in the background relative to interest rate pointed out that the added sentence in paragraph 3 is intended to link the Regarding alternative C as a template for a liftoff statement, I can envision wording similar to that in paragraphs 1 and 2 working well at points, however, about paragraphs or implicitly argued for policy.  Thomas earlier

To be consistent with my just point out, however, that we may therefore the added sentence might come later. overall stance of policy with the funds rate remarks yesterday, I have to agree with this approach.  I'll not have totally wrestled to the ground the question of whether the overall stance of policy includes balance sheet policy, and

'balanced approach' wording in paragraph 4, which, at present, I to consider President Williams's in the now-eliminated paragraph 6, could be made about an policy.  So I raise these points as the broader meaning of as opposed to the phrase 'deviations from.'

let me say I share the concerns raised by with employment being-however natural rate is less than 5 percent.  So that's worth watching. MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  First, President Kocherlakota.  Until wages start rising, consistent you want to describe it-excessively high and inflation at or above 2 percent, I think there's a chance the alternative B.  I don't prefer including the qualifier 'some' in paragraph 3.  I think the economic updates in paragraph 1 should be sufficient can live with including 'some' in the statement. I support don't believe it's necessary, and I to capture the evolving fundamentals for our policy decision.  But, having said that, I certainly

rate, I don't have any major problems with that With regard to the question of whether alternative C contains the appropriate language for when the time does come to raise the target

July 28-29, 2015

the Committee will be monitoring inflation developments statement, either.  I would prefer a couple of small changes-namely, maintaining the commentary in paragraph 2 that closely.  I think that would be important.  I also would include the language in paragraph 4 regarding taking a balanced approach to our policy objectives.

within a reasonable when we make this policy move.  I could not support the language in the if we were beginning to normalize policy before we were, in fact, reasonably me, I'm still skeptical that the data will support reasonable Of course, my comments are premised on the assumption that we actually have reasonable confidence that inflation will be getting back up to 2 percent period of time alternative confident of such an outcome.  For confidence in this inflation outlook by the end of the year, if then.

thought it was interesting that, in the commentary yesterday on the Phillips curve, a faith like.  On variables, which, in this case, are going to play the type of thing.  They're transitory and should be The resource slack isn't really contributing helping us get to 2 percent until we overshoot.  Even then, it's not going to help us will be very small.  For anybody who's done empirical just really hard to get any noticeable slope on that, so the actual effect is pretty small. but, more recently, it's very hard to get results I number of people mentioned they had-however you want to describe it-confidence or that the Phillips curve would reassert itself in terms of inflationary dynamics.  So I went back and revisited what the Phillips curve, as it's usually employed in the Tealbook, looks the right side of the equation, you have a number of variables.  One of them is inflation expectations.  Another is some transitory X part of oil prices, energy, the dollar-that waning.  Then, of course, there's resource slack. very much there one way or another, because we're close to the natural rate of unemploymenr, and it's not very much, because the argument itself work, it's People might remember times when it was larger,

July 28-29, 2015

those.  So most of the heavy lifting to get us to 2 percent is going to depend on this inflation the variables.  It's expectations.  I don't see how you get anything above 1.8 to 2 percent inflation in which is not exactly longer-term inflation expectations, at about 1.8 like expectations term and the waning contributions of the transitory factors, X certainly reasonable that the contributions of the X variables are going to wane, but then that gets us to inflation this kind of environment.  The Tealbook has the-whatever the term is-reference rate for longer-term inflation, percent.  I hope it's moving up.

in that It fits better, but the theory is really much more about a shorter-term kind of inflation two- to four-year variety of inflation up to I understand the empirical reasons why we have longer-term inflation expectations equation. expectation.  You can understand why that would provide some uplift, the so-called gravitational pull about which we all say, 'If it's moving from the the longer term, then that would get us up there.'

just really hard to see any risk of inflation being 2 percent or higher in this type of I foresee pretty I think there's continued risk here that, when percent, we start our normalization process, and we end up with like the Tealbook inflation projection, it's going to be interpreted as looks a lot like a ceiling.  I don't believe we're going to get above That's one of the big risks that I really see with all of this. It's formulation, even if I have pretty good faith in the Phillips curve, unless substantial overshooting on the resource side.  So we say our objective is 2 something that looks indicating that 2 percent 2 percent.

That real activity we'd seen-strong consumer spending growth and labor market conditions-and the sense that forces temporary and likely to pass soon.  The forward guidance we had in place at the time, however, precluded such a move, and the economic consequences of lifting off just a meeting or two later seemed small.

As data have come in consistent with our outlook, the case for raising rates has been getting even stronger, making me less and less meeting without a prescheduled press conference would be a bit awkward, however, because markets clearly do not to the contrary.

Similarly, this perspective suggests evaluating current far we've come over the past millions of jobs the economy has added since 2009, it would seem perverse to delay liftoff if August payrolls fell short of expectations by, say, 100,000.

In paragraph 3, if I understood President Lacker's suggestion, I the relative to' language as opposed to the 'deviations from.'  Despite my in liking 'deviations' language, I think it's too nerdy and too technical for a document to say 'economic conditions relative to.'  I also 'balanced approach' language.

We've probably all said at some time it's unlikely to make much difference whether we lift off in September or December-we rate difference of only 25 for one quarter.

So it's The dynamics of the of that model, about that used to say June or September-for we will be discussing an interest basis points actually discussing a path that more than one quarter.

That strategy should be-and the Chair has said this the gradualness.  At present, I believe the process will be gradual.  We should continue to make it clear, as the Chair has we cannot promise it.

Over the past 20 years, inflation has but it has spent quite a bit of time under target, including much of the past eight years. by dint of the fact that I read what I'm about to say in one of the economic blogs, I can't vouch for its precision, though it's a pretty good blog.  But the author had calculated that headline PCE respectively, both under implied and then said is rise as the output gap shrinks, that intuition doesn't tell us when is the best time the federal funds rate and how quickly inflation may set in.  Even if we are that have counseled moving soon or, indeed, have been a matter of inference from past experience significant Next, I'll note that, although it is quite reasonable to state at a conceptual level that inflation should to increase approaching full employment, we don't know when and how quickly inflation would start to rise. Most answers I have heard to these questions counseled moving some time ago have basically and correlations.  Reasonable as that approach is as a starting point for policy decisions, I don't think it should ever be an endpoint, particularly when current circumstances differ in

I don't believe it's like some a little bit differently than people expect, but I think the odds are that it will be read as validating what the Chair said at her monetary policy testimony.

Underlying core inflation is rise toward the 2 percent objective as long as the economy and, Of course, the recent further commodity price declines in the dollar make it quite unlikely that we will see much pickup in inflation, if any, The more difficult question is clearly whether there is a basis for reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to its especially headline, However, are transitory factors that I would be actually closer to 1.7 percent or so, not that far from our objective.

BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I can support alternative B.  The labor market has continued to improve, and I expect to see further progress toward full before liftoff begins.  By contrast, inflation has remained notably below our target, with no concrete progress that we can point to.  Furthermore, currently low inflation, subdued wage growth, the far in the movement of inflation toward our target as resource utilization tightens could be quite

When crystallizes between a United States starting on a tightening path and foreign risk of additional dollar may well increase. Moreover, there remains a fair risk of continuing downward pressure on inflation from dollar appreciation and falling commodity prices, based on the foreign economic outlook.  China is slowing to an unknown degree and appears commodity prices difficulties in important emerging some time, and any contribution of Europe to global demand is likely to be quite the contrast economies in which monetary accommodation is likely to continue, the appreciation surely put great weight on any action we take, but is subject to a great deal more questions of interpretation think President Kocherlakota noted earlier.  I do believe September should we have available today, along with will be available to us at the September, October, and December substantial uncertainty around the degree of tightening we could see I've heard the case made to lift off in September and then stay on hold for some time. The risk with that strategy is that markets will perhaps less on an expected path that and uncertainty, as I remain a live option.  But, based on the reading of the data the additional data that meetings, as against the

Nonetheless, I believe we have the tools and to manage those risks. In that regard, it's need to view September as the logic, although, of course, I think it's important to be mindful of possible dynamics and possible the capacity market make it compelling, and I'd like to maintain optionality on December.  Thank you. In short, I would favor liftoff in September only if both inflation and labor conditions

alternative B, I think it keeps our options open.  It says we're making progress highly confident that the conditions will be in the next meeting.  In terms of language, I think the word 'some' We've made some progress in terms of the labor market, but we're not there yet, and I think market participants will interpret it in the correct way. In terms of toward our objectives, but not so much that we're place to begin to normalize at sends the right message. quite

C serving as a template for what the statement should look like at the 'economic conditions relative to' with the more wonky 'deviations from.'  I also think the first sentence of bit.  It really reiterates a lot of the thoughts that are in So I'd like to at least put on the table for first part of that sentence down significantly.  People know what our dual-mandate really quite a run-on type of sentence. In terms of alternative liftoff, I'm broadly supportive.  In paragraph 4, I prefer phrase compared paragraph 3 could be shortened quite a paragraph 2-the 'objective of maximum employment' and the expectation that 'inflation will rise, over the medium term, to its 2 percent objective.' consideration something much shorter.  We could just say 'our dual-mandate objectives' and shorten that objectives are; we've said it in paragraph 2.

We membership of some of the core working groups that thinking tentatively that this is a project that might well run end of next year.  I expect that the System groups exploring these topics will be effort.  So I'd be happy to take questions, and are any at this stage.  But our plan is to provide Vice Chairman. Assuming that the Committee is comfortable with initiating a topics, I've asked Thomas and Simon to send a letter soon to all additional would hope to identity over the summer the we intend to put together, and we're through the reporting back to the Committee on a periodic basis, and there will be many opportunities for input by FOMC participants throughout this Thomas and Simon would as well, if there additional details shortly to the research directors.

So I would the staff and everyone around the table to be very open minded in their view and to this issue broadly, without any prejudgment about what we should go to, because there many things that we're going to have to balance here.  There's going to be a lot of learning go through the normalization process and see how some of my advice is to look broadly and be open minded, believe we should really view this as an opportunity to think about what regime we VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

MR. FISCHER.  Yes.
