CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without  objection.  eter. P

MR.  FISHER.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. I  will  e  referring   the b to four ages  of olored  harts  ou should ind n ront  f  you. p c c y f i f o 1/ Beginning on  the irst ge  with  the eposit  ates, u  can  see y  the ed ines  n  the f pa d r yo b r l i top  panel hat  he .S.  forward ates  re  little  anged  since our  last t t U r a ch y meeting.  But  it  s orth  noting hat  oth  the -month  and  the -month i w t b 3 9 forward  rates  ontinue  o  trade  elow  the urrent  -month  deposit  ate, c t b c 3 r suggesting  ome expectation  f  an  ease oming  in  the irst lf  f ext  year, s o c f ha o n but  without uch specificity  it. he two  forward ates  re  trading  n  top m to T r a o of  one  another,  o  it  oes  not ook  as  if  hey mply  a  series  f asings, t s d l t i o e bu some further  asing eems  to  be  priced  n  here. e s i

Looking  at  the erman forward ates,  ou  can  see  that  hose ates G r y t r partially  ticipated,    late  ovember  and  into arly  ecember,  the an in N e D December 3 rd  Euroland ate  ut.  And the orward ates  ontinued  o  drift r c f r c t a little  wer  after  hat.  lso, he orward ates  n  Germany are  trading  elow lo t A t f r i b the  current  -month  rate, ggesting  gain  some  expectation  n  easing  n 3 su a ofa i the oming year.  You can't  ee  it n his  hart,  ut  let  e note hat  here  s c s i t c b m t t i very  little  idence f  greater  ear-end ressure  his  ear han  last  ear n ev o y p t y t y i German funding arkets.  It oes  seem to  be  worth  noting,  iven  the m d g coming  of he  euro  that  he arkets o  not  seem to ave  priced  n  any t t m d h i extraordinary  ar-end ffect.  hat  is lso n  contrast   the ronounced ye e T a i to p year-end ffect  e are  seeing  lready or he  year  after  ext--for  e  year e w a f t n th

2000. So there's  t  much special  ressure  n  German funding arkets no p i m surrounding  he  anticipation   he  euro. t oft

In  the ottom  panel  showing  the apanese  ates, u  can  see  that  n  this b J r yo o scale,  hich  is omparable  to  the op  two  panels,  he  deposit  ates  how a w c t t r s barely etectable se.  ut, s  small  as  it  s ere n  this  hart,   Japanese d ri B a i h o c by standards  his  eally  oticeable. t  me say  that    think  e have  found  too t r isn Le I w many, rather  han oo  few,  explanations r his  entle  acking p  in t t fo t g b u Japanese oney market  rates: hether  it's  at  he conomy is  expected o m w th t e t bottom  out  in he irst lf  f he  year r hat  he ields  n  Japanese t f ha o t o t t y o government  bonds (JGBs)  are acking p,  as  I  will et o n  a  moment, or b u g t i that  he  Bank of apan  is ot eing  quite  o  generous n  its  rovision t J n b s i p of reserves.  one of he  explanations  ntirely tisfactory e,  but  there N t ise sa to  m clearly  as  been  a  gradual ackup  in  Japanese oney market ates. h b m r

Turning  to he  second age, he  three  anels ive omething f  a  review t p t p g s o of  the ast  ix onths  in  financial  rkets.  In  the op  panel,  e have  major l s m ma t w exchange  rate  airs  ndexed o  100 as  of uly  st p i t J 1 . It  hows marks  per  dollar, s yen  per ark,  and  yen  per ollar, d  their  ercentage  hange  over he ast m d an p c t l six onths. m

In  the iddle  panel re  the hree ajor  equity  ndices, so ndexed o m a t m i al i t July  1st t  100.  In  the ottom  panel,  or he oment please gnore  he ed a b f t m i t r line hich  depicts  he GB  yield;    will  ome back  to  that  hortly. ut  the w t J I c s B other hree olored ines  n  that  ottom  panel how various  preads s  they t c l i b s s a have  traded rom  July o he resent. f t t p

My  point  n  bringing  hese  hree  anels ogether  s o  show that  here i t t p t i t t were  really  wo very istinct  isodes f elevering,  ich occurred t d ep o d wh roughly n  the eeks following  he  Committee's ugust  and  September i w t A meetings. here  has  been  a  third  ore modest  delevering ent n he ast T m ev i t l few  weeks associated th  the  year-end. he  very  pronounced  decline  n wi T i both  the ark  and  the ollar  gainst  he en seen n  the op anel  coincided m d a t y i t p with  the ignificant  rmoil  n  early  ctober.  You can  see n  the ottom s tu i O i b panel  that  he hree riangles  int  o he eak  spreads  eached lso arly  n t t t po t t p r a e i October. In  the iddle  panel  you  can  see here  equity  arkets, t east  n m w m a l i Germany and  Japan, eached heir  adirs  uring hat  eriod,  nd  the  Dow r t n d t p a almost  reached ts  adir nd  began  coming back. i n a

More recently,  ere as  been  some gradual ecline  n  the ollar  gainst th h d i d a the  yen, ut t  as  been  relatively  ted, ore  or  less  ssociated th b i h mu m a wi year-end hinness, th  some reversal  f hat  ove in  the  last  ay  or  so. t wi o t m d Also  in  the ottom  panel ou  can  see hat  wap spreads nd  the b y t s a on-the-run/off-the-run ad ave  backed  up  a  little.  ould  emphasize spre h I  w the  thinness  f arkets ather  han  anything lse  ere.  But  in he  middle o m r t e h t panel  you  can  see he  somewhat manic  behavior  f ur  equity  arkets. t t o o m I

seems  to  me rather  ronounced  and  in ontrast   the vents n he  other p c o e i t markets.

Focusing ow on  the  red  line  n he  bottom  panel,  hich  depicts  he n i t w t benchmark  Japanese overnment  bond  yield,  n  the ast  ew  days--and  ince g i l f s your  last  eeting  in act--there   been  an  extraordinary  ckup  in  this m f has ba yield.  he bond  was trading  t   yield  f round  80  basis  oints  t he ime T a a o a p a t t of  your ast  eeting  or ust  efore. t raded t 50  basis oints  esterday. l m j b I t a 1 p y It as off   further   basis  oints  arlier day,  r p to  190.  It as  come w a 40 p e to o u h back  a  little  om  that  evel, ving raded he imit  own today oth  in  the fr l ha t t l d b Tokyo and  London futures  arkets,  nd  it  s ow at bout  180  basis oints. m a i n a p

The  Japanese overnment  first gan  leaking  nd  then esterday g be a y announced  its  orrowing  plans or he oming year,  hich  in  their  orecast b f t c w f will mount to  roughly   65 percent  ncrease  n he mount of apanese a a i i t a J government  bonds  to  be  absorbed y  the  public  ortfolio--that  y  private b p is, b sector  emand. The bond  market  has  begun  to rice  his  n. d p t i

Back in  September  Japanese anks  were  given  a  choice y  the inistry b b M of  Finance ither   treat  heir  onds  on a  mark-to-market  r  on  an  original e to t b o cost asis.  Most of he  banks, irtually  l,  lected  o  do  it  n  an original b t v al e t o cost asis. n  my view, hat  imply  is oing  to elay he  day  of eckoning b I t s g d t r as  yields  ack  up, iven hat  he  holdings  f GBs on  the  balance heets  f b g t t o J s o all inds f  financial termediaries  e  rather  ignificant  a  credit k o in ar s as substitute.   the ields  ack  up and  approach he  average ost f ny  one As y b t c o a institution's ,  that  nstitution l ave  an extraordinary  centive JGBs i wil h in to sell  ut  its  ositions. at  already  eems  to  be  under ay and  is roviding o p Th s w p something  of   continuing  ccelerator  r he ackup  in apanese a a fo t b J government  bonds.  Given  the xtraordinary  ope  of his  ackup  in ust e sc t b j a couple  of  days,   think  t  s easonable  hat  he .S.  and  European  bond I i i r t t U markets  have  been  backing p  a little, apanese ccounts xperiencing u as  J a e these osses  re  off-loading me of heir  oldings  f .S.  and  other  ixedl a so t h o U f income  instruments.

Now, all his  s n  anticipation   he ather  xciting  ear  Japanese t i i oft r e y government  bond  markets re  going  to ave  in  1999,  so  we have  that  o a h t look  forward o.  We  in  all ikelihood ve  the pecter,    my humble t l ha s in opinion,  f  the inistry  f inance rying  o  change  the ccounting  ules o M o F t t a r again  at he nd  of he iscal ar f hese osses  ecome too  extreme  on t e t f ye i t l b insurance  ompany and  bank  balance heets. c s

Turning  to  domestic perations  n  the ext age,  the unds  market as o o n p f h been  a  little  ss table  han ormal, ut here  as  been  some improvement le s t n b t h over  the ast  ntermeeting riod n  terms  of ome reduction  n  the xtreme l i pe i s i e volatility. s  chart  s imilar   the  one  I  presented  t our  last  eeting. Thi i s to a y m On the  vertical is re  the asis  oints  ontained  ithin ne  standard ax a b p c w o

deviation  f  the aily  rading  ange,  nd  on  the orizontal is s he asis o d t r a h ax i t b point ariation   the  daily ffective te  rom  the arget.  he hollow  dots v of e ra f t T represent  bservations   the  intermeeting riod  etween  your  September o in pe b and  November meetings. he filled   dots epresent ys  since our  last T in r da y meeting.  And as  I  did ast  ime,    have  summarized  in he ower  left-hand l t I t l box the esults,  ughly peaking,  gainst  he enchmark period f  the rior r ro s a t b o p year  before ugust. A

As you  can  see,  hile e had  fewer ays  with  very  low  volatility, w w d where  trading  as in  a  tight  ange round  the xpected ate,  e had  roughly w r a e r w the  same number  of ays  within he  50  percent  ox.  Without  counting  he d t b t dots,  et  e point  ut  a  different  y of ooking t his.  n  the eptemberl m o wa l a t I S to-November  period,  ully  /3  of he ays  observed ad  a  standard  eviation f 1 t d h d of  greater  han  .4,  hereas  in  the ore  recent  eriod  nly  1/6  of he ays t w m p o t d had  a  standard  eviation  f ore than  .4. o we haven't me to he oint d o m S co t p of  a  quiet  arket, ut  we have  reduced ome of he xtreme  volatility. m b s t e I think his  as  been  caused y  a  reduction  n redit  oncerns nd  some t h b i c c a greater  ccess o  term  funding arkets,  hich  have  opened  up  to   wider a t m w a number  of  participants. o, arly  n  this  ntermeeting riod  e leaned Als e i i pe w rather  eavily  gainst  irmness, ing  quite enerous n ur  reserveh a f be g i o supplying  perations,  d  when we began  to  take hat  way from  the o an t a market, t ctually ok  the  market  a  while o  figure  hat  ut. hey i a to t t o T assumed, erhaps,  hat  e were  being  more generous han  we in  fact  ere. p t w t w

On the  last  age  I  have  shown the omparable ata or he  same period p c d f t exactly  ne  year go.  I  would  note hat  he ed  dots epresent e ays  with o a t t r r th d high  payment  flows--tax yment  dates,  ond settlement tes,  r pa b da o maintenance eriod ettlement  ates. hey are  really  he  days  when one p s d T t would  expect o  see  the igher  olatility,    that  s hat  we see  here.  In t h v and i w the  1997  period  he  dots n normal  days  are uch more densely lustered t o m c than  in  the omparable eriod  his  ear,  here  we see  a  mix of lue  and  red c p t y w b dots  at he igher  olatilities, cating e igher olatility still e t h v indi th h v we ar facing. ut  I  think  hat  as  calmed  down somewhat. B t h

Let  me note  that  e did onduct   pass o  purchase ndexed ecurities w c a t i s and  we also ndertook  hree onger-term po  operations.  hese  elicited u t l re T relatively  ttle  rket  reaction  nd  went  much as  I  had  hoped.  We  already li ma a have  $12 billion   repos n  the  books  for he urn f he  year,  hich  will in o t t o t w help s  unwind  automatically    reserve  eeds  diminish  fter  he  peak u as n a t year-end eriod. p

Mr.  Chairman,  we had  no  foreign  xchange ntervention  erations e i op during he  period.  e  have  completed he enewal  of ur  swap t W t r o arrangements ith  our  Mexican and  Canadian  colleagues, t ll ur  other w bu a o swap arrangements  ave  lapsed.    will  eed  two  votes,  owever.  I  have h I n h circulated    the ommittee  a  request  o dd  the uro  to  the urrencies to C t a e c in

which we are  authorized  o  operate.    would  propose o  come back  to  you t I t at  a  meeting  early  n he ew year o  discuss  emoving  the  legacy i t n t r currencies.  ut  for he oment  I  thought e would  leave hose lone. o,  I B t m w t a S am seeking  vote  to  add  the uro  to he  foreign  urrency uthorization. a e t c a I will lso eed  ratification ur  domestic perations.    would  be  happy  to a n of  o o I answer  any  questions.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let  me go  back  to he  issue  hat  ou  mentioned ith t t y w respect  o  the ncentives  apanese anks  to  sell  heir  GBs. The banks  are  carrying  hem  at t i ofJ b t J t book and  they  are ngendering ery  large  apital sses.  hose  losses  re  not eing  charged e v c lo T a b against  apital, t  would  be  if  he GBs were sold efore aturity.    didn't ite  et he oint c bu t J b m I qu g t p that  ou  were  making. y

MR. FISHER.  My  understanding  s  that  nce  the rice f he  JGBs declines  elow  the i o p o t b cost t  which they ere  purchased,  he anks  will ave  to  recognize    loss. a w t b h a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Is  it ost r  market  or  both? c o

MR.  FISHER.  It s ost r  market, hichever  they hose. They were  given  a  choice. i c o w c Virtually l hose  cost.   may be  wrong,  but  I  went  over his  ith  the inistry  f inance al c I t w M o F representative  New  York  just  esterday, d  my understanding  s hat nce  the arket  price in y an i t o m reaches ost,  he anks  will  hen  have  to ecognize    loss. c t b t r a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That  is he ld-fashioned rket  or  cost asis f t's t o ma b i i below  market.  Once they  reach ost,  t  ecomes a  loss. c i b

MR. FISHER.  That's  ight.  ut  I  think he ay they  will iew  this  s ot n  a r B t w v i n o bond-for-bond  asis. hey will ook  at  the  average ost f heir  GB portfolio.  d as  the b T l c o t J An market  price pproaches hat  evel,  hey  will ant  to e  liquidating  e ortfolio fore  he a t l t w b th p be t breakeven oint s  pierced. p i

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Why?  I  can  see t  n  a  bond-by-bond asis.  hey may i o b T have  a  different  y of eeping heir  ooks.  We  do  it ond-by-bond; ou are aying hey o not. wa k t b b y s t d

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. I  think  here ay be  a  distinction. t m The accounting  robably s ond-by-bond.  But  if  ou are anaging  the ortfolio,  u  are  going  to p i b y m p yo say: "It s pproaching reakeven o  I  better  et id f t."   think  he ccounting  ould  be  the i a b s g r o i I t a w way you  described, t he  managerial pproach  would  be  to unch  these ecurities. bu t a b s

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It s oor  management if    understand  hat  they re i p I w a trying  o  do, hich  is o ide heir  osses. t w t h t l

MR. FISHER.  Well,  would  it  urprise  ou if  hat  ere-s y t w

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I  won't omment on  that! n a seemingly elated c O r subject, oticed  hat  n  the ottom  graph  on  page  2 you  show the .S.  10-year wap spread ver I  n t i b U s o Treasuries,  ich  is omewhat more than  80  basis oints.  n  Britain  t  s lso bout he ame wh s p I i i a a t s order f agnitude.  On the ontinent,   I  recall,  s bout  30  basis  oints.  oes  this  eflect o m c as iti a p D r a presumption n  the arket  that  here s ore sovereign  acking f ommercial  bank  liabilities i m t i m b o c on the  continent an  either re  or  in ritain? f  hat  s ot  the nswer, hy is here uch  a h he B I t i n a w t s significant  fference   spreads? di in

MR. FISHER.  I  have  not ound  an  acceptable  xplanation  hat  yself. t s f e oft m I i something   have  tried  o ollow. o my first sponse  s hat    see  it  s  a  bit f   mystery.  I I t f S re i t I a o a think t's  pecially  mystery  if  ou realize at  hese  wap spreads,  s  most  of s  measure  them, i es a y th t s a u are  from  a  common panel  of ajor  international ks.  So  the  difference   spreads hould e  a m ban in s b credit  ssue, t  it  s ard o ull hat  ut hen one  is ooking  t   common  panel f  global i bu i h t p t o w l a a o players  ho  are he  ones  we look o  for  uotes n  these wap spreads.  hat  mean that  s w t t q o s T i somehow  embedded in--I  on't  ven  know how to  express t.  o term  comes to  mind  to  express d e i N this;  'm t   loss. I a a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. There  has  to e  an  answer  because omebody is idding b s b 30  basis oints  or ne  and  80  basis  oints  or nother, ich  suggests  hat  hey ee  a  difference p f o p f a wh t t s and  are  doing t  or   reason. i f a

MR.  FISHER.  There  are  some in  the arket  who think hat  uropean  central  anks m t E b are  active  n  this  arket. i m

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That  is   potential planation. a ex

MR. FISHER.  Yes,  that ould  be. w

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That  goes  to  the overeign  redit  ssue. s c i

MR.  FISHER.  It s oming  in  through he  demand side ather  han he  supply ide,  f i c t r t t s i you will. ut  I  have  not nterrogated   foreign  entral  ank  counterparts ough  to etermine B i my c b en d this.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. If ou  have  a  chance, ould ou track  t own? y c y i d MR.  FISHER.  Yes,  I  may be  able o  do  so. t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The only  reason   raise  he ssue  s hat  t  ay be  telling I t i i t i m us  something bout  the  issue  f ubsidization    the  system, hich  is   useful  nsight   roven. a o s in w a i if p

MR. FISHER.  Yes,  we will  try o  look  into hat  urther. t t f

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Any further  uestions? q

MR. POOLE. Is  this  he ppropriate me  to ring p  the ssue  f ndexed onds  that t a ti b u i o i b we talked  bout  last  ime? a t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes.

MR.  POOLE. I  happened  to  be  on  the orning  call  hen the esk  first ught m w D bo indexed onds,  and  there  as a  very  large  eaction   the arketplace.  t  eems  to  me that  his b w r in m I s t experience  aises  he  question  hat    brought p  before,  bout hether e should e  buying r t t I u a w w b

indexed onds  for he  FOMC b t portfolio. m still  posed  to  it.  n  my view  it roduced  a I  a op I p substantial  ange  in he  yields  hen we went  in  that  ay.  I  think ur  operations  his  arket ch t w d o int m are  going  to  muddy the nterpretation he nformation  e can  get rom  the arket. i of  t i w f m

MR.  FISHER.  You saw a  rather  ignificant  hour eaction,  esident  oole.  I  think s 1r Pr P the  1-day  and  3-day nd  3-week  reaction s rather  uted.  So,  my first int  s hat  rying  o a wa m po i t t t measure  this  n  a  minute-by-minute  asis  nvolves  orking  with  too  short    time orizon.

That  said,  ctivity  is  uarter  ppears nce  again o  have  surpassed  ur a th q a o t o previous orecasts.  hat is he  explanation  his  ime?  Unfortunately, f W t t t I can't  ive  as  neat n  answer  as  I  would  like.  learly, e  piece f he tory g a C on o t s is ur  earlier derestimation  he  rise  n  motor  vehicle  roduction, ich o un oft i p wh accounts or bout  half  he  extra  rowth  of DP  in  the urrent  uarter. f a t g G c q Some of  this  eflects e utomakers'  ompetition  or etail rket  share, r th a c f r ma but  heavy  trucks  ave  been  strong,  oo. nother  piece f he tory  s  that, h t A o t s i while  we thought hat  omebuilders  ad  a  sizable  acklog f  demand to t h h b o meet,  we couldn't resee  hat  he  weather  would  be  as  cooperative   it as fo t t as h been.

But, o eepen  the pr e s b t d mystery,  he  IP  data hemselves re eaker  over  the econd  half f his  ear t t a w s o t y than  would  be  suggested  y  the orresponding  xpenditure  omponents  of b c e c GDP.

That  brings  e to  the rospects  or he urther owing f  GDP  growth m p f t f sl o in  1999. As you  know, we're utting    lot f eight  on  the otion hat p a o w n t accelerator  fects ould e  shifting to everse  ver  the oming quarters. ef h b in r o c That  is,  he latness  utput  rowth  for   while ow implies  hat  e should t f ofo g a n t w expect he  level f nvestment  o  tend o  stabilize. t o i t t

As the erceptions  f usinesses  nd  households egarding  he p o b a r t prospects  or heir  ales  nd  incomes  moved up  in  recent  ears,  hey f t s a y t presumably  wanted  to xpand  their  tocks f apital ods  to evels  hat e s o c go l t would  help rovide he arger  lows  of roduction  nd  consumption p t l f p a services.  pending  on  business  quipment,  ouses,  nd  consumer  durables S e h a consequently  ose arkedly.

Finally,  few words  about  the upply ide f ur  forecast:  he recent a s s o o T upside urprise  n  GDP  growth  does  not  appear o eflect y  unexpected s i t r an improvement  in  productivity  ends.  ather,  hat  we've  seen  has  been tr R w consistent th  the  trend  e have  been  assuming.

Notably,  nstitutional  ancing  or ffice  nd  retail t t i fin f o a space  construction pears o  have  returned  o  at east  ome parts f he istrict ter ap t t l s o t D af disappearing r   while  in  the hird  uarter  s  a  result  he arket  turbulence. fo a t q a oft m

On the  other  and, ur  contacts  n  the anufacturing  ector  ontinue  o eport  hat h o i m s c t r t District  ants  nd  factories  e  feeling e ffects  f ower ommodity prices  nd  increased pl a ar th e o l c a foreign  ompetition.  s you  know,  we do  a  monthly  manufacturing  urvey nd  it howed  that c A s a s employment dropped  sharply  n  the anufacturing ector, rticularly  the obacco ndustry, i m s pa in t i machinery  fabrication,   textiles.  t  on  the ore encouraging ide,  he urvey lso ndicated and Bu m s t s a i that  actory  hipments ose n  November to  a level  e have  not  seen  for ome time.  We  have  a f s r i w s question  n hat  urvey  about xpectations   future  hipments nd, omewhat encouragingly, i t s e of s a s that  igure  ose n  November for he  first me  since  ay.  So,  there ay be  some signs f f r i t ti M m o a bottoming ut  in  this  ector, though he  signs re  still  irly ak. o s al t a fa we

As far s  labor  arkets n  our  region re  concerned,  t's  rd  to  believe  ut,  f a m i a i ha b i anything,  hey eem to  be  getting  ven  tighter    the ervice  ector, pecially    the nformation t s e in s s es in i technology  ector.  e  get  more reports  f  labor hortages  ow than e did  a  while ack, nd s W o s n w b a efforts   hire nd  retain  orkers  are eally  ery  aggressive. ey were  already  ggressive  ut,  f to a w r v Th a b i anything,  hat  ggressiveness  s  become even  more visible cently. t a ha re

At  the ational vel,  e agree  with  the taff at  he ost  likely  utcome  in  coming n le w s th t m o months  is hat  eal DP  growth  will ecline  o  a  rate  loser  o rend. t ertainly ems t r G d t c t t I c se reasonable  o  expect usiness  nvestment  n  particular    decelerate,  ven  the rospective t b i i to gi p slowing n  corporate  arnings.  ut  a  good  deal  of he urrent mentum i e B t c mo in  consumer  spending should arry hrough,  nderpinned y  the  recent  trong  rowth  in  jobs nd  in  real  ages. c t u b s g a w

I  think  he mportant  oint  ere s hat  ven  if  verall owth  does  in  fact  low  to t i p h i t e o gr s trend,  hat  ill  ot  necessarily  lieve e  current  xtraordinary  ghtness   labor  arkets.  It ill t w n re th e ti in m w only  stop he  tightening  at  as  been  accompanying  above  trend  eal  rowth  from  increasing t th h r g further.  n  other  ords, ven  with  the  slowing,  e may still    above  the aximum  path  on I w e w be m which  the conomy can  grow without n  increase  n  inflation   ome point  own the  road.  It e a i ats d certainly oves  that  nflation  rrently mains  exceptionally  ll ehaved.  We  can  take  some pr i cu re we b credit  or hat,    think, d  we should. ut  some time  next ear he ecline  n  commodity prices f t I an B y t d i and  in mport rices  f anufactured  oods  should nd  as  Asian  economies  begin o  heal.  At i p o m g e t that  oint,  oods  price  nflation  uld ell ottom  out nd  begin  to ise  ather  han  offsetting  e p g i co w b a r r t th service  rice  ncreases   has  been  the ase ecently. p i as c r

With this  n  mind,  and  as  we enter    period  here  our  focus s hifting om  trying  o i a w i s fr t achieve rice tability    trying  o aintain  rice  tability, ink e need  to  ask  ourselves  ow p s to t m p s I  th w h we judge  whether he olicy  hoices e are aking  now are  laying  he  foundation  or ontinued t p c w m t f c low inflation    a  resurgence  f nflation,  for hat  atter  eflation. e Greenbook  forecast or o i or t m d Th and  the ssumptions nderlying  t  erve s  the asis or he  Committee's  iscussion  his a u i s a b f t d oft crucial  uestion  t ach  meeting.

MS. MINEHAN. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. There  is ot  a  whole  lot  ew in  New n n England, t  least  ince he ast  ommittee  meeting.  The regional  conomy continues  o row, a s t l C e t g albeit  t   pace  a  bit  ower han arlier    the ear. nemployment varies  y  state  ut  in he a a l t e in y U b b t aggregate  s bout  a  percentage  oint ower  than n  the est  f he  country. ob  growth, n i a p l i r o t J i contrast,   lower han  in  the ation  s  a  whole,  with  New  Hampshire  having ewer obs han  a iss t n a f j t year  ago  for he econd  month in  a  row. t s

As I  noted  at he ast  eeting,  ome of his  lowness n  job rowth  reflects  e egion's t l m s t s i g th r demographic  trends. opulation  n ew  England  simply rows  more slowly han n  the est  f P i N g t i r o the  nation.  e  frequently ar tories at rowth  in  certain  ndustries, ical  care or W he s th g i med f example,  is ampered  by  the  lack f  available bor upply. he fastest owing  industries    the h o la s T gr in region ontinue  o  be  construction,  e eneral rea f inance,  nd  services.  anufacturing obs c t th g a o f a M j declined  n  all ix tates  gain n  October,  eflecting ecrease,  e think,  n erchandise xports i s s a i r a  d w i m e to  the roubled  sian  areas. t A

Turning  to  the ational  utlook,  e were  pleased  o ee  the hange  in he reenbook n o w t s c t G forecast om  November. The Greenbook  now projects tes  f  GDP  growth  and  levels  f fr ra o o unemployment in  1999 that  re  quite  lose o ur  own.  We  differ  bit  n  the nflationary h, a c t o a o i pat as  we have  over ime. ut  we have  been  continually  ong in  that  rea,  o  I  must  say  I  am a  bit t B wr a s humble in  that  egard. r

Overall,  oth  the reenbook and  our  own forecast scribe  n  economic  picture  hat b G de a t may be  the est f  all  ossible  utcomes:  a  relatively  ooth  slowdown in  the xpansion ith b o p o sm e w very  few  downside  risks,   the omestic ront  nyway. The question  s hether his  utcome on d f a i w t o will ctually cur.  Others  have  spoken  about isks  nd  I,  too,  hink  hat  here  re  large  isks. a oc r a t t t a r And they  occur n  both  sides.  n the lus ide,  he omentum  from  1998  could ropel rowth o O p s t m p g in  1999  and  tighten  abor arkets urther.   this  cenario, nsumers  would  not  retrench  nd l m f In s co a the egative  mpact  of  a  slowing conomy might  not ffect  orporate  rofits   significantly. n i e a c p as If this  oincided  ith  some luck n  the xternal  ide--if  pan's  rowth, or xample, urned c w o e s Ja g f e t slightly  sitive   the  euro  acted s  a  major ositive r rowth  in  "Euroland"--then nditions po or a p fo g co might  be  right  or n even  greater  purt  f nflationary ssure  han e project. f a s o i pre t w

On the  downside, nd  maybe more significant    terms f robability, wth  could  be a in o p gro slower f  onsumers  did  decide hat  he isks  osed  by  higher  ayoffs, clining  orporate  rofits, i c t t r p l de c p and  a  volatile  ock arket equire  hem  to  save  more and  spend  less  han rojected.  aning st m r t t p W corporate  rofits uld  cause  the tock arket  to ecline  harply  ather  han o  move roughly p co s m d s r t t sideways,  s  we and  the  Greenbook  have  projected,  d  could ncourage urther nsumer a an e f co retrenchment.  ad luck  on  the xternal  ide--Brazil,  xample--could  ell  add  to  the egative B e s fore w n effect.

As I  consider  hese isks  oth  on  the pside nd  the ownside,   must  say  I  am struck t r b u a d I by  the igh  cost f  being rong.  From where  we are ow,  necessary  olicy  hanges  to orrect h o w n p c c situations  uld ell  produce  negative  esults,   east  nitially. .S.  and  world  growth  is co w r atl i IfU stronger  han  projected,   eems inevitable  at  inancial  rkets ill oar nd  inflationary t it s th f ma w s a pressures  ill ise.  he question  ill e  whether  we can  intervene  n ime.

For  the ational  conomy,  I  think  e have  an  unusually  ide  spectrum f lausible n e w w o p outcomes.

- At  the ational  evel,  ur  broad  outlook, ke  thers,  ot  markedly  different  om  the n l o li o isn fr Greenbook  but  with  some differences    composition.   xpect ome slowing n  consumer in Ie s i spending,  usiness  ixed  nvestment, d  housing,  ut o  date here  s ittle  ncrete  vidence hat b f i an b t t i l co e t those rends  re  beginning o  develop. ndeed, he ear-term  utlook  s ore positive w,  given t a t I t n o i m no the  revisions   the stimated  hird-quarter   and  the ikelihood    strong  ourth  uarter  s to e t GDP l ofa f q a well.

My view is hat  he  more pessimistic  recasts y be  giving oo  much weight o t t fo ma t t further  eterioration  the nternational tor  nd  its  mplications r .S.  growth.  It  s y d i i sec a i fo U i m sense  that  e probably ave  already  xperienced  he runt f he  declines  hat  ill  ake lace nd w h e t b o t t w t p a that ur  domestic conomy remains  quite trong.  mployment growth  continues  t   strong o e s E a a pace; nemployment is  down;  consumer  incomes  are p;  and  energy, teel, d  other  ommodity u u s an c input  rices  ontinue  o ome down. The view  that  eclining rporate  arnings  rojections ll p c t c d co e p wi both  damp investment  xpenditures  nd  depress hare rices, ereby utting  ack  on  consumer e a s p th c b

Additionally,  e ffects  f  the ast hree  ate  uts ave  not  yet ully  orked  their  ay th e o p t r c h f w w through he conomy.

On the  other  and, arts f  the istrict  at  ave  been  struggling r ome time h p o D th h fo s continue  o  struggle. riculture,  d  especially vestock,   ne  example  of hat;  ining  and t Ag an li iso t m the nergy  sector  re  a  second; nd  parts  f he anufacturing  conomy are  a  third.  would  say e a a o t m e I that  n  those ectors,   nything,  he roblems  have  become more significant   attitudes  ve i s if a t p and ha deteriorated it  urther.  f  course,  ost  people nd  the ulk  of he  economic  activities  n a  b f O m a b t arei the  major etropolitan  reas,  o  in rying  o ut his  ogether  ne  doesn't nt  to xaggerate m a s t t p t t o wa e some of  those ut-state  oblems, s  it ere. o pr a w

As far s  the ational  conomy is oncerned,  wo  aspects  f t  ave  struck  e for ome a n e c t o i h m s time.

I  think he utlook or he  economy in  general  s ositive  erms  of ustainable al t o f t i p int s re growth.  There  are   couple f ignificant  wnside  risks  hat  eople ave  commented on. One a o s do t p h is  the razilian tuation d  another  s,  t  least   some people's dgment,  n  excessively B si an i a in ju a elevated  quity  rice. ut  I  don't  now what  probabilities ttach  o  possible  orrections e p B k to  a t c in those  situations.    fact,  t  s y view  that  e probably ill et  more  real  rowth  or t  least In i i m w w g g a more growth  in  aggregate  emand than  is ndicated   the reenbook  over  the  next ear r  two. d i in G y o

Taken  by  itself  at  s ertainly sitive. e question  s  what  rate f nflation   ikely th i c po Th i o i isl to accompany it. o far t  least, e urprises   the nflation  mbers  have  been  on  the  downside S a th s in i nu and  that  s o he  good.  And the eakness  in  commodity prices  uggests  hat  hat  ay continue. i t t w s t t m

On the ther  and,   must  say  that  he apid  rowth  in  the onetary  aggregates  nd o h I t r g m a generally  ccommodative  credit  onditions  o  give  me some pause.  They are  a  source f  at east a c d o l some potential ncern.  At  a  minimum  we need  to onitor hat  losely. co m t c

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Teer. Mc

MR. MCTEER. Texas  employment  growth  has  decelerated om  fast  o oderate fr t m during he  course f  1998--from bout .6  percent  n  1997 down  to  about   percent  ately.  hree t o a 4 i 2 l T head  winds  or rags re  causing his  rowth  to  moderate. ne is ight  abor  arkets.  They have d a t g O t l m been  tight  or   long ime,  ut  we have  less  nd  less  bility  ttract rkers  into  exas  from  the f a t b a a toa wo T rest  f he ountry ecause he  markets  are  tight  verywhere ow. o t c b t e n

The low  oil rices  hat  ack  Guynn  mentioned ave  hit  s  very  hard.  Incidentally, p t J h u our contacts  xpect il rices  o  remain  very  low  for onger  han he utures  arkets re  suggesting. e o p t l t t f m a In  our istrict,  traction  ployment has  declined  y  about  5,000  and  the ig ount as D ex em b r c h declined  round  37  percent.  f  course,  ow  oil rices  re  not  nearly  s  harmful o  our egion f a O l p a a t r o the  country ow as  they  were  back  in  1986. Not  only  are  we more diversified,    we have  more n but energy-using  ndustries  at  enefit  rom  low  oil rices  han e did hen. i th b f p t w t

but  they ay not  have  as  much room on  the iscal de. o,  there re  some risks  ecause m f si S a b Europe's  conomy seems  to  be  slowing omewhat. e s

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Rivlin.

MS. RIVLIN.  Let  me make three  eneral  oints  bout he  situation   find urselves g p a t we o in  at ear-end.  ne is hat  he ontinued  terling  rformance f he y O t t c s pe o t U.S. economy is eally r remarkable,  nd  it  s oing o  be  worthy  of ome serious  cholarly tention r ome time  to a i g t s s at fo s come. A year  or  two  ago  the ress,  conomists athered  t eetings,  nd  even  the OMC p e g a m a F were full  f alk  bout   possible  ew era. e  did ot  all ndorse t,  ut e all alked  bout  it. ome o t a a n W n e i b w t a S of  us  were  trying  o xplain  ow labor arkets ould emain  so  tight  ithout  ausing age t e h m c r w c w

Then we all ot  distracted    the orldwide  economic  crisis d  our  effort  o aintain g by w an t m our  island  f  prosperity   he idst f lobal  urmoil  or he orld's  ake  as  well  as  our wn. o int m o g t f t w s o But  while e were  distracted,   U.S.  economy continued o hug  along,  umping out  goods w the t c p and  services,  king better  nd  better  se  of  limited bor upply,  ewarding kill th  wages ma a u la s r s wi that rovided  ncentives   acquire ore skill,  nding ut  bonuses  to  high  performers, t ot p i to m ha o bu n shifting to he  mode of  general age inflation.  reover, ood productivity  owth  continued in t w Mo g gr even  in  manufacturing  here  demand slackened nd  payrolls  ere  falling. e  urge  to w a w Th modernize  and  computerize emained obust  n  the ace f  macroeconomic  forecasts at  ight r r i f o th m have  prompted  retrenchment  n  earlier  as. he U.S.  economy really  oes  seem to  be  working i er T d better  han t sed  to ork. It s ore flexible;    s ess  nflation  one.  The  good  performance t i u w i m iti l i pr is ore remarkable he  longer  t ontinues. m t i c

Second  point: t s ossible  hat  ne  of he hings  e all hought  e knew about I i p t o t t w t w monetary  policy as  to  be  unlearned, mely  that t  perates  ith ery  long ags. ack  Guynn h na i o w v l J referred   this  n  the pposite  irection,  t  I  don't  hink  e  and  I  are aying nything to i o d bu t h s a inconsistent.   was reminding s  that  he  full  ffects  he olicy oves of  the  last  ouple f He u t e oft p m c o months  have  not et  been  felt, mething e would  not  have  needed  to  be  reminded f   few y so w o a years go.  We  would  not  have  expected he ffects  o e  completely  ncorporated t. a t e t b i ye

We  used  to hink  hat  entral  ankers ad  to  take ig eaps nto he ark  because ur t t c b h b l i t d o policy  nstrument, ile  powerful n  the ong  run, ffected e conomy only  over  periods f   to i wh i l a th e o 6 18 months  or ore. But  now we find urselves  ith  a  tool hat  eems  to  work  faster.  ur m o w t s O

actions  n  September  through ovember are  credited th  strengthening--or etimes  credited i N wi som with  overheating--the .  economy in  the  current  uarter, t  to ention  the rospects  or he U.S q no m p f t first lf f  next ear.  One reason s he  increased  mportance f quity  arkets oth n ha o y i t i o e m b i financing  usiness  xpansion nd  more importantly   enhancing onsumer  wealth.   think he b e a in c I t wealth  effect  s ot  going  to e  temporary. t  ill nly ecome more important  s  prosperity  d i n b I w o b a an longer ifespans mbine  to  increase  he ortfolio   the verage amily. hat  is ot  so  true  n l co t p of a f T n i Europe  yet,  ut t  urely  ill e  in  the oming  decade  and  elsewhere round  the orld  as  well. b i s w b c a w So,  we have  to earn  o  accept ealth  impacts n  consumer  behavior  s  an  increasingly  portant l t w o a im aspect f  the onetary  equation. o m

Another  phenomenon that  as  cut  the ags s he rowing  importance f onsumer h l i t g o c credit  nd  home mortgages. he ease  of efinancing me mortgages nd  home equity  oans a T r ho a l makes the  transmission   monetary  policy  oves into onsumer  behavior  ore direct  nd  faster. of m c m a The growth  of  global quity  lows nd  sensitivity lobal  arkets o  information  lso e f a of  g m t a magnifies  he  effect  f olicy  oves by  the orld's  mportant  entral  anks, amely  us  and  the t o p m w i c b n soon  to e  created  CB.  So,  we have  a hotter strument  n  our  hands  than  we used  to ave  and b E in i h we had  better  et sed  to  it. g u

Third  point: he world  is till  scary lace.   won't rgue  with  the reenbook T s a p I a G forecast,  t  I  believe  e will ll e  lucky f  t omes  to  pass.  While  there  re  some upside isks, bu w a b i i c a r which have  been  mentioned,  t  eems  to  me that  he isks  re ostly n the ownside.  There  is i s t r a m o d Brazil,  hich  is till ry  uncertain.  here  is ussia,  here  more chaos  is ossible  nd  the orld w s ve T R w p a w community seems  absolutely ralyzed  bout hat  to  do.  There  is apan, here  the orst ay pa a w J w w m be  over,  ut e have  said hat    lot f imes efore nd  the ossibility  spiral  eflation b w t a o t b a p ofa ofd is also  there.  nd there  re ountries  ll round he orld  that  e have  not ocused n.  There  is A a c a a t w w f o

also n  uneasy  knowledge  that  hatever lows  up  next,  he  turmoil  ill pread apidly  hrough a w b t w s r t world  markets  in  unpredictable  ys. So,  despite  y optimism bout he undamentals  t  home, wa m a t f a I  think  e had  better ok arefully r orld  trouble  nd  hope  that  e know enough to  use  our w lo c fo w a w increasingly  ort-lagged licy  ool ppropriately    e have  to. sh po t a if w

On balance,  inancial nditions, anks n  part o  recent  onetary  policy  ctions, f co th i t m a continue  o  be  supportive  f rowth  going  forward. here  are evertheless  ausible ounds  for t o g T n pl gr projecting  slowing f  growth.  The rationale  r he lowdown is ell resented  n he a o fo t s w p i t Greenbook,  though  it hould e  admitted hat  irtually  l he rguments,  ncluding  he s b t v al t a i t dissipation   he  positive imulus  rom  the ealth ffect,  e  dissipation   ccelerator  fects, oft st f w e th ofa ef etc.,  ere  considerations  at  nderpinned he rojected owdown for 998. w th u t p sl 1

On balance,    expect rowth  to  slow  to  about -1/4  percent  n  1999  and  I  see   somewhat I g 2 i a better  alance ow in  upside nd  downside  risks.    think  he  upside isks  rincipally  flect  e b n a I t r p re th experience  f  continued  ositive mand shocks hat  fter  ome point ake me wonder  what  we o p de t a s m might  be  missing bout  the undamentals riving  his  xpansion. he downside  risks  ave  been a f d t e T h well  discussed  round  this  able.  hey relate  rincipally   razil,  o uestions  bout  the a t T p toB t q a sustainability  urrent  quity  rices, d  to  other  ressure  pots n  the orld  economy. of  c e p an p s i w

Let  me note  two  upside isks  elative    the taff's lation  recast.  I  have  noted r r to s inf fo As at ecent  eetings,    find he  Greenbook  forecast    slowing n ominal  wage growth r m I t ofa i n somewhat aggressive.  he risk  ere  can  perhaps e  seen  by  comparing he orecasts r ominal T h b t f fo n wage change  based  on wage-price  nd  wage-wage versions  f he hillips rve,  wo a o t P cu t specifications t  re  routinely acked  y  the  staff. e forecasts r he  wage-price tha a tr b Th fo t specification  int o  a slowing f  nominal  wage changes  going orward--and  erhaps po t o f p a significant  owing--as  he esponse  o he  recent  ecline  n nflation  d  the rojected  odest sl t r t t d i i an p m rise  n  the nemployment rate  ominate  the ffect  f he revailing w  level f he i u d e o t p lo o t unemployment  rate. ome of  the  wage-price pecifications icate  slowing f  as  much as  a S s ind a o

percentage  oint  n  the ate f ominal  wage gains n  1999. On the ther and, he orecasts p i r o n i o h t f from  the age-wage specifications  gest   sizable  ncrease  n  the ace  of  nominal  wage gains w sug a i i p going  forward. oth  of  these pecifications e  yielded  imilar  rrors  ver he ast our ears, B s hav s e o t p f y and  they re  now  generating  orecasts at  iffer   as  much as a f th d by 1-1/2 percentage  oints ver  1999. p o I  think his  ighlights  e onsiderable  ncertainty  out  inflation  ing  forward. t h th c u ab go

Second,  the reenbook  allows or ome diminution  n  the  favorable  actors at  ave G f s i f th h been  suppressing  nflation: eversal  f  declines  n  oil rices;  ome further preciation  he i a  r o i p s de oft dollar;  reversal  f he  recent  ecline  n  non-oil  ommodity  prices; d  a  faster ce  of ncrease a o t d i c an pa i in  health  are nd  health  enefit sts.  he dissipation   he ontribution  om  these pecial c a b co T oft c fr s factors  s he asis or he onvergence f  actual  o  core nflation    the reenbook forecast. t i t b f t c o t i in G Bu I  am concerned hat  he rojected bounds n  these omponents  could esult  n  somewhat higher t t p re i c r i inflation  an  in he taff  orecast d  that  n  addition  here  s   particular  side isk  rom  a th t s f an i t i a up r f sharper-than-projected  reciation    the ollar.  hank you. dep of d T

As a  number  of  you  have  indicated,  e isks  n  both  sides ave  widened.

Since he  prices  f T i i o e ho t o

As a  consequence, o h fo a pe o t realized ins ssociated th  the  sales  f  homes have  been  significant.  increase  n ga a wi o The i mortgage  debt hat  ne  can  attribute   xisting me sales ay be  derived y  taking  he et t o toe ho m b t n change  in  mortgage  debt n  single-family  mes and  subtracting  om  it  he ebt hat  ne  would o ho fr t d t o anticipate    here  ere  no  turnover  f xisting mes--that  s,  ew debt aken  out  on  new home if t w o e ho i n t sales  ess cheduled  mortization   existing rtgage  debt.  The net  of hose wo  subtracted l s a on mo t t from  the  total tstanding  ebt s   reasonably  ood  estimate  f he ncrease  n  debt n  existing ou d i a g o t i i o homes. That  number  looks  remarkably lose o  independent  stimates  f apital ins n  the c t e o c ga o sale f  homes. The assumption ere s hat  hat  oney is  extracted om  the  home market, hich o h i t t m fr w of ourse  it  s.

As a b o tow s wr d consequence,  he  aggregate  mount  of  realized pital ins n  housing nd,  in  a  rough  sense,  he t a ca ga i a t amount of et  debt  on  existing mes have  been  going  up  commensurately ith  the ramatic ise n ho w d r in  sales  f xisting mes. o e ho

Theoretically,   can  say  that  f  he ash  received  y  the eller  nencumbered, one i t c b s isu which  of  course t  s,  here  s o  reason hy it  ill ot e  used  to ake purchases.  he i i t i n w w n b m T economics  literature onsistent  th  the iew  that  onsumer  spending nd  cash  flows  move is c wi v c a hand  in and.

The trouble, fortunately,  that  he  stock arket  and  existing me sales  re ot un is t m ho a n uncorrelated.  is  makes it  ifficult  form  a  judgment  as  to  whether hat  we think  s he tock Th d to w i t s equity ealth  effect  s eally  n  part  he ousing ealth ffect. e reason his  s mportant  s w i r i t h w e Th t i i i that  hen the  stock arket  declines,   ver,  t oes  not  necessarily  llow hat  he ame pattern w m if e i d fo t t s will ccur n  existing me sales. s a  consequence,  nless  e are  able o  disaggregate e o i ho A u w t th wealth ffects  hat  re nvolved--and  are  going  to  do  some of hat nalysis   get   sense f e t a i we t a to a o those ffects--the ecast  f inal  omestic emand in  the ext  year r  two  will  e  a  very e for o f d d n o b complex undertaking.

I  think  hat  omes  from  what  are ow,  fortunately, y,  ery  deeply p t c n ver v embedded views  about  price tability  continuing  ow  inflation.  ck  in  the  1970s  when firms s or l Ba would  raise  rices, her irms ould  use  that  s  a  good  excuse o aise  heir  rices  lso. ow p ot f w a t r t p a N

when firms aise  rices,  ther  irms o  not  follow,  nd  the  original ice  ncrease  ets olled r p o f d a pr i g r back.

There  are mportant  xceptions  o  this  ypothesis at    am offering. til he ast  ew i e t h th I Un t l f months,  the  dollar s  tended o e  strong  ather  han eak. We  have  not een  increases ha t b r t w s in prices  f  foreign  ssets  elative    the ollar.  ertainly l nd  other ommodity  prices  ave o a r to d C oi a c h gone  down sharply.  il  is n  important  sset  hat  an  be  held n  the round; t  oes  not ave  to O a a t c i g i d h be  produced. ut  I  am persuaded hat  he  money growth  that  e have  seen  is howing  up more B t t w s or  less  s  we would  expect n he conomy and  that t  xplains    great eal f hat  we see n  the a i t e i e a d o w i current  ituation. s

Ned Gramlich  earlier lked  bout  the ifficulties  xplaining  he oney growth  that ta a d of  e t m we've  seen.  I  would  like o resent  n analogy ere.  Suppose  we saw a  jump,  let's  y, n  the t p a h sa i ECI. If e could  explain  hat  ump  as  a  consequence f ome anomalies n he ata r  faulty w t j o s i t d o seasonal djustment  r  something  like  hat,  might  feel omfortable  ith  the ump.  But  if  e a o t we c w j w could  not xplain  hat  ump,  I  think  ll f s  around  this  able  ould  assume  that,  nd  behold, e t j a o u t w loa we were  finally arting   see  the esults  he abor arket  pressures  n  that  umber. So,  the st to r oft l m i n fact hat  e cannot xplain  n  detail  here  this  oney growth  is oming  from  or here  it  s t w e i w m c w i showing  up  is ot   source f omfort o  me but  a  source f oncern. n a o c t o c

If t ere  not  for he act  hat    tightening day  would  be  a  very arge  hock  to he i w t f t a to l s t market, iven  our  recent  asing oves,  I  think  here ould  be  a  case or ightening  w because g e m t w f t no we are  working  through he redit  arket isturbance. e bond  market  is  functioning rmally t c m d Th no again;  he umber of ew issues  s ack  more or  less  here  it  as.

MR. HOENIG. I  am speechless!  ut  I'm oing  to  say  a  couple f  things  nyway. B g o a

First, upport our  recommendation  completely.  Without  getting  nto ananas  or gonizing, I  s y i b a I would  caution  s  about  how we look  at he eed  for uture  olicy  ctions.  ere I  associate u t n f p a H myself  a  little  th ill oole.  I  think  e need  to  look t  the ctions  e take n  terms f he wi B P w a a w i o t risks,  specially  e isks  o he omestic conomy,  and  the  systematic  orces  hat  re n  play hat e th r t t d e f t a i t lead o  the pside isks: ur olicy  asings,  he apid  onetary  growth, trong  omestic emand, t u r o p e t r m s d d and  robust  ncome  growth.  I  think hose actors  o  give s  pronounced pside isks. i t f d u u r

- On the  other  ide,  he ownside  risks,   Governor  Rivlin aid,  re isks  f hocks, s t d as s a r o s which are  impossible  o t forecast. I'd  uggest hat  e consider  ot  holding ff  oo ong  on  the s t w n o t l unwinding  of  our ecent  asing ctions  s  we worry  about  the ownside  risks  rom  shocks  that r e a a d f might  occur ut  also ight  not ccur. o I  want  to  be  thinking  bout  unwinding  our  earlier b m o S a actions  nless ome real hocks  emerge. u s s
- MR. BROADDUS. I  agree ith  your ecommendation, r.  Chairman, ot  with w r M n agony--that uld  be  too  strong    term--but  ith  at east  ome sense f nease.  What I wo a w l s o u especially ree  with  in  your  recommendation  is our  statement  hat  e are ow back  at he ag y t w n t point f  looking t  the isks  n  both  sides f he quation.  y  feeling  s hat  hey  are ow o a r o o t e M i t t n probably kewed  to  the  upside.   agree  with he  comments that  arry eyer made and  Bill  oole s I t L M P as  well.

The other  s he  possible letion  f he  sentence  n the rowth  of he  money supply t 3 i t de o t o g t a the  very nd  of he  directive.  I  understand  t,   the asis f ur  previous  iscussions,  ere  s e t As i on b o o d th i

strong  upport  or ption  at his  oint. ome members of he  Committee  have  focused n  the s f o 3 t p S t o question  f  deleting e  language n  the  middle f ption regarding  he  months  ahead, believe, o th i o o 3 t I and  some have  raised    question  bout eleting e  money supply anguage. t ould  be  helpful a a d th l I w if  e went  around  the able  airly ickly  o  get   statement  rom  each  of ou  on those ssues.  t w t f qu t a f y i I may be  that  f  e get   significant  dal value n  these,  e can  finally ing his  iscussion  o  a i w a mo o w br t d t conclusion.

MR. BOEHNE. May I ask  one  question, .  Chairman? Mr I was one  who,  just  or f language urposes,  anted  to  drop  the entence: Any potential anges  in  the ederal  unds p w s " ch f f rate...." e expressed    concern hat ne  of he  subtleties    that ording  related   your Som a t o t of w to authority   act n  the ommittee's ehalf  etween  meetings. ne view  was that ropping hat to o C b b O d t sentence  omehow  might  be  interpreted   erceived  s  compromising  your  authority tween s orp a be meetings. My question  o  you  is:  Do you  believe  hat  he eletion  f hat  entence  n  any  way t t t d o t s i creates    perception  f  compromising  your  authority? a o

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. We  will ow go  back  to  the ld ssue  f  disclosure n o i o policy.  summary of  our  past iscussions d  positions   this  ssue  nd  a  proposed olution A d an on i a s have  been  written  ut nd  I  will  roceed o  read t. o a p t i

The Committee  has  had  two  very  productive  iscussions is  ear n  disclosure sues d th y o is other han  the ilt nguage,  t he une-July  eeting  and  the eptember  meeting.  However,  the t t la a t J m S Committee's iews  seem to  have  evolved ainly nto wo  disparate sitions,  th  of hich v m i t po bo w have  presented  ery  cogent rguments  in  their  avor. ne group,   small ajority  f he  18 v a f O a m o t governors nd  presidents,  pports: 1)  eleasing e perating  aragraph f he  directive,  ich a su ( r th o p o t wh includes  he  tilt,  mediately fter  very OMC t im a e F meeting; 2)  releasing  brief  nnouncement ( a a immediately fter  hose eetings n  which  either  he olicy tance r  the  tilt   hanged; nd  (3) a t m i t p s o isc a releasing e  minutes  of he  meeting s  soon  as  feasible ter  very OMC th t a af e F meeting,  resumably p a couple f  weeks  earlier  an  now. o th

Another  group,   sizable  inority, vocates  eeping he tatus  uo  in  all  hese a m ad k t s q t respects.  hat  is,  he perating  aragraph ould  continue  o  be  released  long ith  the inutes T t o p w t a w m after  he ext eeting,  nd  immediate  announcements  would  routinely   made only  after  olicy t n m a be p changes.

Finally, o  presidents uld  drop  the ilt tirely om  the  operating  aragraph. tw wo t en fr p My  impression  s  that  n  general  he ommittee's iews  have  become held  with i i t C v increasing nviction  nd  have  polarized  nto hese wo  main groups. s Chairman  of  the co a i t t A Committee  I  would  strongly  rge  that  n  a  matter ike  his  ne, here  any  change  will  e u o l t o w b irrevocable   practice,  e  FOMC in th should ot  adopt  a  reform ased  on  a  narrow  favorable te, n b vo with  a  sizable  inority  f he  governors nd  presidents rongly  pposed.  A small hift   the m o t a st o s in voting alance oward  status  uo would  not  enable s  to everse  olicy  ny  more than  a  death b t q u r p a sentence  s eversible  ter  eing arried  ut. i r af b c o

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Wow!

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Instead,  would  propose   compromise solution,  ich I a wh we can  try ut n an  experimental  asis  t  least  or he ime eing. hat  compromise,  which  I o o b a f t t b T may say  was crafted  y  Don Kohn  in  a  Solomonesque  insight,  uld  be  for he ommittee  to b wo t C continue  ts  urrent  ractice  f eleasing  e  operating  aragraph nd  minutes fter  he ext i c p o r th p a a t n meeting  but o  expand  the overage f ts mmediate  announcements  to  include  hose nstances t c o i i t i where,  even  when policy  as  been  kept nchanged, he  Committee  wants  to  communicate  to  the h u t public    major  shift   its  iews  about he  balance f isks  r  the ikely  irection  uture  olicy. a in v t o r o l d off p This  announcement  would  be  reserved  or ituations    which  the onsensus f he  Committee f s in c o t clearly  as  shifted gnificantly,  ugh  obviously  ot  enough  to  change  policy,  nd  in hich h si tho n a w markets  would  be  informed hat  ur  thinking  as  changed  in  order  o  avoid  seriously sleading t o h t mi them. It ould  not  apply very ime  the  tilt  s changed  where  these  hanges  in  the ilt w e t wa c t encompass only  small hifts   the enter  f ravity  f  Committee  thinking  r  where  in  the s in c o g o o context  f  incoming  data he  markets ave  already urmised  he  shift   Committee  thinking. o t h s t in

The announcement  itself  uld  not  necessarily  ference  he ilt t nstead  ould  concentrate wo re t t bu i w on  the hange  in  the ommittee's  ssessment  f conomic  prospects. c C a o e

For  example,  under he ompromise  we presumably  would  have  made an immediate t c announcement  after  wo  FOMC t meetings  this  ear  when we did ot  change  policy.  n y n A immediate  announcement  after  he  late  arch meeting  would  have  indicated at  he ommittee t M th t C had  seen  a  shift  way from  a  situation   which  prospective rces  ere  roughly ffsetting    one a in fo w o to in  which  the isks  f  greater flation  emed apparent.  uch  an  announcement  would  have r o in se S avoided  some confusion ver  the ntermeeting riod s  market  participants  tempted  o o i pe a at t interpret  r  remarks, nd  an  unauthorized  isclosure  he  tilt  curred. ou a d oft oc

An immediate  announcement  after  he  August  meeting  would  have  conveyed  the t Committee's  erception  f  a  change  in  the isks  rom  rising flation    a  more balanced utlook. p o r f in to o In  the vent,  s  you  recall,  th  your  agreement   revealed  he hift   a  speech t erkeley e a wi I t s in a B following  ur  Jackson ole  discussion.  ould  have  been  better  ommunicated, n y o H Itw c i m judgment, ith  a  Fed  statement.  s was  demonstrated  fter  he ast  OMC w A a t l F meeting,  n a announcement  can  be  used  to onvey  the essage  that  he ommittee  has  changed  its  ssessment c m t C a of  risks, cluding    sense f he ilt, n  without he  release  f he  operating  aragraph. in a o t t eve t o t p

The compromise,  which  is uggested  y  Don Kohn and  which I  fully  upport, ils s b s bo down to  a  commitment at imes f  a  major  shift  n he ommittee's entiment  o  take dvantage t o i t C s t a of  the urrent  isclosure licy  n  which  the ommittee  has  reserved  he ight  o ake an c d po i C t r t m announcement  in  the bsence  of olicy  hanges.  When  the OMC a p c F announced  its  ew disclosure n procedures  n  February  1995,  the  statement  aid n art hat  t  ould "announce  each  change  in i s i p t i w the  stance  f onetary  policy, cluding  ntermeeting anges,  he ay  they re  made. When  no o m in i ch t d a change  is ade at  a  meeting,  he ommittee  will ormally ust  nnounce  when the eeting m t C n j a m

ended  and  that  here  re o  further nouncements.  However,  in  some infrequent rcumstances, t a n an ci the  Committee  might  decide o  issue    statement  ven  when no  policy ction  s aken." t a e a i t

With  respect  o he mplementation  f  this  articular  ange  in  policy  hat  s eing t t i o p ch t i b recommended,  because  the ecommended compromise represents   implementation  f he r an o t Committee's urrent  olicy  ith  variations,  suming  that  n  informal  onsensus f he c p w as a c o t Committee  agrees ith  the dea,    do  not  think  hat    formal ote oday ould  be  needed.  I w i I t a v t w should oint ut  that  hould ou  concur ith  the  compromise, t  ould  not  foreclose  ater ifts p o s y w i w l sh in  procedures  n  either rection sed  on  our  experience  ith  this  pproach. n  fact,  suspect i di ba w a I I our  experience  ight  help s  to  reach   consensus. m u a

Finally, ws of  this  pproach ill et ut  when the inutes f his  eeting  are ne a w g o m o t m released  n  early  ebruary,  nd  I  could iscuss  t urther   my February umphrey-Hawkins i F a d i f in H testimony. f o, hese rocedures  ould  be  put  in  place y  the arch FOMC I s t p w b M meeting.

MR. GUYNN. Clarification,    Chairman.  I  may not  have  listened refully ough Mr. ca en but  I  am not lear:  ould this  e  a  statement  rom  the ommittee  and  would  the tatement  e c W b f C s b reviewed  by  the ommittee at he  meeting  after  hich  it  s o  be  released? C t w i t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes. At  the oment, we now discuss  ur  position  ith m o w respect  o olicy  n erms  of lternatives  B, or  C,  and,  secondly,  ith  respect  o  tilt.  en  it t p i t a A, w t Wh appears ppropriate,  ere ould  be  a  third  lement n  the iscussion,  ich would  be  a a th w e i d wh statement  he  Committee  might  wish  to  make. And that tatement  ould  be  cleared  nd  edited t s w a by the  Committee.

MR. KOHN. That  process,  r.  Chairman, ould  be  approximately  he ame one M w t s followed hen there re  policy  hanges  now. That  is,  ou would  read o  the ommittee a  draft w a c y t C of  the roposed tatement  nd  ask  for heir  omments. p s a t c

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Meyer.

MR. MEYER. Mr.  Chairman,  your roposal  s   compromise  that    can  heartily p i a I endorse.  Indeed,    think    would  argue hat  t  s etter an ither e tatus  uo  or  at his  oint I I t i i b th e th s q t p going  to  the mmediate  release  f he perating  aragraph. s you  know,  I  have  been  an i o t o p A advocate f  the  immediate elease  f he  operating  aragraph  n  general  nd  the ecision  n  the o r o t p i a d o tilt    particular.  t  I  also gree ith  you  that    change  like  his  hould ot e  made unless in Bu a w a t s n b there  s   stronger  onsensus  han ow exists. i a c t n

It eems  to  me that  hat  your  proposal  oes  is hat  t  espects  he iews  of he ajority s w d t i r t v t m by affording  n  opportunity   make announcements  about ymmetry on  those ccasions  hen it a to s o w would  be  most  constructive.    that  egard, is pproach  goes  a  long ay toward ulfilling In r th a w f the

objectives at    have.  But  it  lso espects e iews  of he inority  y  not aking a  formal th I a r th v t m b m change  in  the perational ocedures  hat  annot e  easily  eversed. o pr t c b r

And,  as  you  also ndicated,  ere  s   chance  to xperiment.  Let's  ee hat  happens. i th i a e s w Let's  ee  how useful  n  practice ese nnouncements  are, nd  let's  so et   feel or he  degree s i th a a al g a f t to  which  they ffect  he  dynamics  of ur  decisionmaking  nd  consensus-building.  e a t o a Th discussions   have  had  around  this  able  ver he  last  ouple f  meetings ave  given  me a we t o t c o h better  ppreciation  he  potential  sts s  well  as  the ikely  enefits   an  immediate  release. a oft co a l b of Given  the ncertainty out  this  alance,    think  our  compromise  is   perfect  olution. u ab b I y a s

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  inehan. M

MS. MINEHAN. I  think  he ompromise  makes a  lot f ense  as  a  way to ry ut t c o s t o a simple ecitation   he  reason hy no  policy  hange  was made. I  have  long elt  hat  o policy r oft w c f t n change  is s  much a  decision  s  a  change  in  policy  s--that  ere  s   policy  ontent  o  whatever a a i th i a c t we do at  all f  our eetings. t  times t  ould e  very seful,  s  you  have  suggested,   release o m A i c b u a to an  explanatory  tatement.    think  he  experience  e had  with he  short  tatement  fter r  last s I t w t s a ou meeting  gave  us  an  indication at  his  ould e  quite  ositive   terms f ow the arket  reacts th t c b p in o h m to  what  we are oing.  In  that  ase,  he tatement  as  made in he ontext  f   policy  hange. d c t s w t c o a c Still,    rovided   little  planation  t,  nd  that  ives s  some insight to ow a  simple it p a ex ofi a g u in h discussion  f he  understandings   the  Committee  beyond  no  policy  hange  would  be  reacted  o o t of c t in  the uture.  o to  me it  s ery  definitely tep ell  worth  taking. f S i v a  s w

I  also gree ith  your  view  that  aking  a  major  move in  what  we say  to he ublic a w m t p about  what  we are  doing  without  ull  onsensus,  ithout verybody  buying  in, ould otentially f c w e c p be  a  real  roblem  and  that  e could ot  go  back. p w n

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  roaddus. B

MR. BROADDUS. Mr.  Chairman,  I  certainly derstand  he  dilemma  we face nd  I un t a agree  that  e need  to ave  a  strong  onsensus efore e make a  fundamental hange.  I  suppose w h c b w c this  s robably    good  step,  ut  'm ot  quite  s  sure r onfident  f hat  s  other  eople.   think i p a b I n a o c o t a p I there s ome risk hat  t  ould  cause onfusion  n  the arkets nd  for he ublic enerally. i s t i c c i m a t p g I guess  I'm hinking  f   situation  ere  there  s o  change  in  basic olicy  ut here  we change t o a wh i n p b w the  tilt.  I  understand  t,  ometimes  we would  announce  it  nd  sometimes  we would  not; As i s a I don't  now what  the  criteria  ll e  and  I  think here  s oing o  be  some head  scratching t k wi b t i g t ou there  bout hat.   can  certainly pport  our  suggestion.  owever,  I  think  t  ould  be  very a t I su y H i w useful o  have  a  formal ommitment that    year rom  now we will evisit  is  ssue nd  evaluate t c a f r th i a in  some detail  ow it  as  worked.
