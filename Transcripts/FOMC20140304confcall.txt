of the Federal Open Market Committee Conference Call on Transcript March 4, 2014

appreciate your making time for this that we all be together in person for my first meeting as Chair offered.  But let me express those CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon, everyone.  I meeting.  I would have preferred so I could thank you personally for the good wishes you have thanks nonetheless.

would like to defer the end of the meeting.  But if time permits after we have discussed forward guidance, sure he would be glad to take them up.  The main purpose of reach agreement on how to Steve Kamin distributed a note on developments in Ukraine, and I that until if you have questions for Steve, I'm this meeting is to discuss our forward guidance so that we are able to revise it in March.

And despite the weaker tone of recent data, the threshold could be crossed soon, may need to remove in also the post-threshold period.  In light of the complexities for us to discuss some context of a regular meeting where the state of the economy and a policy The unemployment rate, at 6.6 percent, is very close to the threshold in our FOMC statement. perhaps even before our March meeting.  At a minimum, this means that we the threshold language at the March meeting.  But many of us have expressed an interest providing more information about involved in modifying our forward guidance, I thought it would be useful options outside the decision take priority.

to make a couple of general comments about our forward guidance as having served a very important role accommodative and as having thereby supported the recovery. point when a return to something close to full employment By way of introduction, I would like forward guidance.  I personally see in keeping financial conditions Now that we have finally reached the

to remain mindful, though, of the numerous 'false dawns' the and downside risks.  For this reason, and also for remains important that our forward guidance continues are as clear as possible, the conditions under which policy will remain lasting end to this lengthy zeroI would urge everyone economy has presented.  The effective lower bound on interest rates still imposes an important asymmetry on our ability to respond to upside purposes of policy continuity, I believe it to convey, in terms that highly accommodative in order to promote recovery and a interest-rate episode.

behavior after the 6.5 percent threshold is crossed.  And with market reluctant to offer less guidance in March than we provided in December and January. We did add some language in December that provided specific information about the Committee's likely expectations now well aligned with both that guidance and our own views, I would personally be quite number of important issues for us to consider in revising our guidance, and I a number of you provided, and they helped shape the memo and for this videoconference. There are a want to thank the staff for their thoughtful background memo.  I appreciate the very useful comments and suggestions that the materials circulated 1

So the present moment could provide an attractive opportunity for more For today's statement, and it is labeled as option 5.  But I asked the staff to focus the memo on changes that go well beyond such a essentially necessitates a nontrivial expecting a

Despite substantially clarify our intentions, remembering, as always, that some perhaps along the lines of the one circulated by the best.

Now may be an appropriate time to signal this shift in the staff memo focused on the state of employment to our assessment of its maximum sustainable level.  This formulation has the virtue of new concept into the statement and might itself seem to call for some language circulated last Friday simply makes an assessment of whether the recovery in the labor market is complete.  This Let me highlight four specific issues raised in our First, the current guidance is focused on the unemployment rate, but we have consistently communicated that once evaluation of the labor statement.  Some of the options suggested in the relative being taken from our Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, but this approach would bring a new, single measure of slack.  Alternatively, the reference to formulation might accurately bring to mind the broad assessment that we actually engage in.

become more prominent.  It might be appropriate to clarify inflation in our policy intentions beyond the clause we added in December that current target range is likely to be maintained, especially if projected inflation run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal.  The first two options in the Second, over the past several months, the possibility of inflation running persistently and significantly below our objective has the role of low specifies that the continues to

This could be warranted, for example, either concerns over financial continues and the economy strengthens, or, alternatively, to convey a willingness of the FOMC to respond if, say, financial conditions tighten in a way that compromises the outlook for attaining our objectives.  The options both of these considerations.  And option 4 provides an alternative financial-stability risks.

if the recovery continues as we all hope, we will face an increasing need to new normal.  The current statement mainly suggests that the FOMC that sheds little light on policy in the broad range of likely cases in which both objectives, so that any need to balance remains well in the future. Finally, clarify how policy will be conducted during the transitional period between liftoff and the time when we settle into some will, after liftoff, embrace the balanced approach from the consensus statement.  But this is language employment and inflation are falling short of our conflicting objectives included in the first four options, the staff has provided two as a very general of the reaction function, whereas the second is focused on the fact that even after we to price stability and full employment, the appropriate federal funds rate target may as normal in the longer run.

If you have any questions for just begin the go-round.  [No response]  Okay.  Seeing no questions for me, why don't we begin the go-round, and let's start with President Kocherlakota.

Chair.  Let me be the first, in this group, role.  I look forward to working with you in your new MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam at least, to welcome you to your new capacity.

your framing our discussion as ably as you did.  I also found the options and staff for the memo. I appreciate analysis in the memo dated February 21 to be quite valuable, and I want to thank the great work that was included in that two parts.  First, I'm going to address the question of forward guidance about the future evolution of the federal funds rate. use the answers to this question to inform my preferred choice among the five staff. I want to divide my remarks into why we need to provide Second, I'll options offered to us by the

to a well-documented statistical pattern of behavior-that In the absence of forward guidance from us, or in the of deliberately vague forward guidance like that in option 5, markets are likely to turn Taylor (1993) rule or the Taylor (1999) FOMC behavior.  The problem is that, as the Summary of I see two related answers to the question of why we need forward guidance.  The first is connected to policy effectiveness.  In my view, monetary policy can be effective only if markets and the public have a good understanding of our reaction function.  Before the financial crisis, that understanding came from decades of historical experience-historical experience in which the FOMC adhered relatively closely is, something akin to a Taylor rule. presence back to those pre-crisis historical relationships, like the rule, to provide their guide to future

March 4, 2014

is likely to be more accommodative than either are going to deviate from our pre-crisis reaction informative as we can be about the reaction function that we are information.  So that's the Economic Projections indicates, monetary policy of these rules for years to come.  Given that we function, we need to be as actually going to use, and good forward guidance can provide that effectiveness argument.

to credibility. appropriate policy would be long-run average inflation rate noticeably below 2 percent.  Against this recent be at all surprising if the public and markets still saw the new 2 as being more of a ceiling than a true target.  We need to be using our our reaction function to build the credibility of our 2 percent target by the public and markets that we are in fact doing whatever we can to facilitate a rapid to 2 percent inflation. The second reason why we need to provide forward guidance relates Before January 2012, the FOMC did not have an inflation target of 2 percent.  Indeed, several FOMC participants, including my predecessor, thought that consistent with a historical backdrop, it would not percent inflation marker forward guidance about assuring return to do two things:  to make clear that our years will differ importantly from what we did prior to the Those are the reasons why we use forward guidance. I think we need to be using forward guidance reaction function over the next few crisis and, relatedly, to make clear that we are purposefully making choices to keep inflation at 2 percent.

those reasons, I see option 3 as being a great example of the kind of guidance that that it the FOMC is highly unlikely to raise the target fed funds rate at least until to two-year-ahead outlook for inflation has risen back to 2 percent.  Raising the fed true target.  Rather, Given we should think about using.  I see option 3 as having four desirable attributes.  The first is assures the public that the onefunds rate before that point would imply that we don't see 2 percent as a

March 4, 2014

to see sub-2 percent inflation as being an outcome for monetary policy.  Now, I want to be clear:  The need to wait until the It is an actual description of how inflation-targeting central banks operate For example, the Bank of Canada has a single mandate-to keep inflation equal to 2 operating practice is to adjust policy so that inflation is projected to return to 2 to 8 quarters, ranging from 6 to 11 quarters.  It is mandate, but we want to be about what that means for policy.  It does not provide a rationalization for raising the employment mandate is responsible for making the FOMC is responsible for making sure means that the employment mandate can than a strict inflation-targeting central bank like the Bank cannot rationalize being less accommodative than an inflation-targeting central such an action would imply that we continue appropriate inflation outlook has returned to 2 percent isn't some arcane result from some fancy-pants theoretical framework. in practice. percent.  Its percent over some period of time that is close true that, unlike the Bank of Canada, we also have an employment clear federal funds rate before the inflation outlook gets back to 2 percent.  The is fundamentally asymmetric in nature.  It does not say that the FOMC sure that employment doesn't get too high.  It says that that employment doesn't stay too low.  This asymmetry rationalize being more accommodative of Canada, but it bank.

observers have suggested that waiting until the outlook for inflation has returned to inconsistent with the FOMC's historical behavior.  That may be right, but target, our actions need to be is exactly why we need to include actions will be consistent with that target, not with our past behavior. Some 2 percent is historically we didn't have a 2 percent inflation target.  That is a very recent development.  It goes back to January 2012.  Now that we have a 2 percent inflation consistent with that target, not with our past behavior.  This this kind of 2 percent inflation floor in our forward guidance.  And we need to underscore the message that our future

March 4, 2014

desirable attribute of option 3 is that it does not have an employment think this is going to be challenging for us, because it may seem that, by not An employment threshold actually works against the maximum employment.  The reason is that such a threshold is designed to give the escape clause that lets it raise the fed funds rate even though inflation is under control inflation outlook is still at 1½ percent, if unemployment falls below, 6 percent, that kind of threshold gives the FOMC an escape clause that lets it raise even though the inflation outlook is still too low.  So I see adding such a threshold as being with promoting maximum employment, and leaving it out also gets around a lot of trying to define how we want to be thinking about the labor market. The second threshold.  I including an employment threshold, we are not putting as much emphasis on employmentwhereas in fact the opposite is true. promotion of FOMC an simply because the unemployment rate has gotten too low or employment has gotten too high. For example, even if the say, 6½ or rates inconsistent problems of desirable feature of option 3 is that it appropriately allows for the possibility that modulate risks or because we want to loosen financial market A third the FOMC might choose to alter monetary policy in light of financial market developments either because we want to conditions.  I think option 3 allows for both of those possibilities.

in particular reminds the public and markets that the FOMC is not returning of behavior. Finally, I like both elements of paragraph 6, both the first and second sentence.  I think the second sentence to its historical patterns my opening remarks, Madam Chair.  We need forward the ways in which our reaction function over that we are fully committed to keeping inflation I'll close by echoing some of guidance.  We need forward guidance to make clear the next few years will be different from what we used in the pre-crisis period.  And we need forward guidance to make clear to the public

March 4, 2014

to 2 percent.  I think option 3 does a good job on both dimensions.  Thank you, Madam close Chair.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you, President Kocherlakota.  President Bullard.

that today we have lined up a mind-numbingly complex discussion for think that's a good way for you to get started in your new role. MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair, and welcome to your new role.  I'm looking forward to it, and I see you to navigate, so I

many of you did, I appreciated the staff memos on this topic.  They really from several presidents.  I will my discussion here around three issues that are key from my perspective, which opening remarks. As I suspect helped my thinking, and so did the comments on the staff memos organize actually dovetail with what you said, Madam Chair, in your this opportunity to change out the The second question is:  Is there a case to making inflation the focus variable and deemphasizing any real variable?  And the question is;  How should the Committee reference financial-stability issues?  I'm going to you The first question is:  Does the Committee wish to take real variable in the qualitative description of our reaction function from unemployment to employment or, possibly, to some other real variable? be made for third talk mainly about these three issues here and not too much about the fourth issue that mentioned, Madam Chair.

comment on each of these questions in turn and, along the way, on some of the forward in the memos.  Let me just foreshadow my conclusion modestly negative on the options in front of the Committee.  My bottom is that, as a practical matter, the Committee should proceed with changes to the existing may cause more problems for the Committee than they solve. I will specific alternatives that were put here.  My comments are line thresholds in a minimalist way, relying mostly on simple qualitative language.  Attempts to do more in the current circumstances

March 4, 2014

in the existing Several of the alternatives suggest that the Committee no longer its So let me reach that conclusion by discussing these three questions.  Question 1 was, should the Committee take this opportunity to change out the key real variable qualitative description of our reaction function from unemployment to employment or, possibly, to some other real variable? refer to unemployment and instead use 'the projected shortfall of employment from maximum sustainable level.'  I have several comments on this particular language.

it may be a minor shock to financial markets, referring explicitly to unemployment.  I am not may come as something of a surprise. First, I think we should keep in mind that households, and businesses that we are no longer sure how markets will actually react to this.  Many understand that we are unlikely to retain an explicit numerical threshold for unemployment as the economy nears more normal performance, but removing the reference completely

One reason for this is that employment projections in the SEP, so it seems like we would have to provide information outside the SEP employment level.  On balance, my 'unemployment' to 'employment' in this way may FOMC intentions.  This can, of course, be managed, may be quite difficult. Second, and perhaps more important, I think that considerable uncertainty may attend the very notion of an employment shortfall, as well as how the Committee intends to measure it.  I think it would be very hard for financial markets to infer, based on what we have so far provided, what this phrase means for the date of liftoff. are not process as to what might be considered an appropriate judgment is that changing the reference from create unwanted uncertainty around future but I think it to the idea that the Committee might wish to use an alternative real a comment to the Committee, I suggested real output growth as that alternative First, unlike employment levels, which are not projected This thought leads variable.  In variable.  This has several advantages.

March 4, 2014

market indication of what the Committee is expecting to the key real variable mentioned in the statement.  Second, in my view, a move traditional to normalize.  Referencing output employment gaps.  Athanasios Orphanides, in particular, is who has emphasized the pitfalls of gap mismeasurement and has suggested that better guidance for monetary policymakers. in the SEP, output growth is explicitly in the current SEP.  This would give financial participants and others in the economy a clear with respect toward more emphasis on output growth would move the Committee closer to approaches to monetary policy as the economy continues growth also has the advantage, according to some studies, of avoiding monetary policy mistakes associated with level-based output or one author output growth rates might provide may worry that output growth today is relatively robust and, therefore, that real variable, accommodative policy because of today's lower-than-expected inflation outcomes.  I recognize, to go in this direction at this time, but I we want to change out unemployment for a new real variable, this might be a at some point in the future.  As you suggested, Some of you this might suggest a more aggressive policy than the Committee intends.  But, in my view, even with a reference in the statement to output growth as the key can still be rationalized Madam Chair, that the Committee may not be willing think that if reasonable alternative-if not now, then perhaps Madam Chair, this meeting is probably a good opportunity to at least consider possible alternatives, and that's why I'm putting this one forward.

my second question-namely, is there a case to be made for making variable and deemphasizing references to a real variable?  This idea is memo.  I think there is a compelling case for going in this This type real variables to be as robust as possible, This leads to inflation the focus contained in option 3 in the staff direction, which I would characterize as something closer to strict inflation targeting. of option would make clear that the Committee prefers

March 4, 2014

the Committee to Here I am unwittingly made, particularly the idea that Committee would not want to be putting such limits on real variables.  After all, we provided that no serious inflation problem develops, and so does not require put explicit limits on either levels or growth rates of real variables. echoing some of the arguments that President Kocherlakota just perhaps the want low unemployment, high employment, and so on.

much to commend it in terms of transparency, simplicity, andmay be realistic in terms of levels of unemployment, employment, or only educated guesses in any event?  Would it not be better and simply set monetary policy accordingly?  If rates can soar, is this not all the better?  The answer is that, indeed, it in our Surely this approach has I believe-consistency with what the Committee truly desires.  Why should the Committee put limits on what it thinks output growth when those limits are to react directly to evidence on inflation alone this means that unemployment can move to very low levels, employment levels can be quite high, and output growth would be better, and so, in many ways, I think that promoting inflation as the key variable communication has much to recommend it.

text refers to projected inflation between is credible for a central bank to project inflation over term as being different from target, at least under ordinary circumstances.  Indeed, as criterion for optimal inflation-targeting policy in policy exactly so that inflation would be projected to equal the the central bank could increase the amount of Still, my sense is that the Committee may not be ready to go in the strict inflationtargeting direction, and, in any event, I think option 3 as written does have one important problem.  The problem, at least in my view, is that the one and two years ahead.  I do not think it the medium President Kocherlakota just stressed, the very many models would be to set target over the medium term.  Any projection that does not meet this criterion would normally be viewed as involving suboptimal policy, because

March 4, 2014

perspective.  If the Committee's inflation forecast does not equal the target over term, why doesn't the Committee simply increase the amount of accommodation so accommodation in a way that would make the projection equal to target over the medium term. Because of this difficulty, I see the adoption of the approach in option 3 as problematic from a communications the medium that the inflation forecast does equal the target over the medium term?

me to question 3, which is how to handle references to financial stability in topic, I think a minimalist reference is appropriate.  We need to show that understood by the Committee without overstating how much of a factor this may be 'irrational exuberance' speech by former Chairman anyone inside or outside the Fed has to be reminded that stability is an important concern in the making of monetary policy.  If we make a to financial stability, that will be sufficient to remind everyone that we are issue. This brings the statement.  On this the topic is in Committee decisionmaking.  The Greenspan was given in 1996, and since that time, the Committee has struggled with two extraordinary bubbles in the U.S. economy.  The debate on monetary policy and bubbles continues to rage.  I do not think that financial minimal reference fully cognizant of this option 5, with its more minimalist in the Committee's forward guidance paragraph, is most thresholds and replaces the previous text the The considerations I have emphasized suggest that approach to changing the language likely to succeed in delivering the continuity sought by the Committee in contemplating this change of language.  This approach simply removes the with references to a wide variety of indicators and a notion of complete recovery in labor markets in the future.  This last criterion will cause some uncertainty as to its meaning but at same time suggest that a judgment call will have to be made by the Committee based on a wide variety of factors.  This is a better approach for the time being and, in my view, moves the

March 4, 2014

reference to financial included through the phrase 'readings on financial developments.' Committee somewhat closer to normal monetary policy.  An oblique stability is on I think would On balance, then, Madam Chair, I prefer option 5 of the options presented to the Committee for its use of mostly qualitative language to replace our existing thresholds unemployment and inflation.  The other options suffer from key drawbacks that introduce unwanted uncertainty into financial markets' understanding of Committee intentions. Thank you, Madam Chair.

a pleasure to be serving in the first capacity. MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  It is meeting in your official

language we choose does the neutral effect on expectations.  Expectations seem appropriately aligned thinking at this time.  Given the weakness in incoming data, I would MR. ROSENGREN.  My hope is that the forward guidance following.  First, as in the memo on the different options for forward guidance, I believe the language should have a with the Committee's certainly not want the language to tighten financial conditions.

implications for our current thinking on the likely liftoff date.  This is the statement that the current target range for the federal funds rate will be It is tied to our modal interpretation of this language will be that liftoff the latter half of 2015. Second, given the market focus on calendar dates, the language needs to avoid adding to uncertainty around the achieved by maintained 'for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends.' actions-namely, the tapering program.  Since the tapering program can be slowed down or sped up, it has flexibility.  However, the would likely occur in

March 4, 2014

language should be as simple as possible.  The difference between purchases rise in short-term rates that followed the announcement of possible Third, the and liftoff and between triggers and thresholds has been surprisingly difficult to communicate, as witnessed both by the tapering in the middle of last year and by the confusion that persists around the 6½ percent threshold.

the option that gets closest to these objectives is option 2.  It is designed to In my view, have a neutral effect on expectations, provides clarity on likely liftoff, and has a relatively simple construction.  However, I think it should be simplified further.

option 2, paragraph 5, I would substitute the first area highlighted in blue with 'the are normalizing and the inflation returns to the Committee's longer-run goal of 2 percent.  In market conditions, the Committee will consider a broad seems more consistent with the concept of the SEP, although normalizing would incorporate For Committee will consider the projected pace at which labor markets projected pace at which assessing the improvement in labor range of indicators.'  The concept of normalizing long-run unemployment forecast provided in the more than just the unemployment rate.

option 2, paragraph 5, I would substitute the second area highlighted in blue with 'at the process of normalizing, inflation projected continue to be well anchored.'  This refers back to returning to normalized an inflation ceiling, 'does not exceed percent.' For least as long as labor market conditions are in between one and two years ahead does not significantly exceed 2 percent, and longer-term inflation expectations labor markets.  It also replaces language that sounds like 2 percent,' with 'does not significantly exceed 2

on financial developments In terms of the other questions, I would not include language at this time.  I do not believe we have clarity or consensus on this issue yet, and we probably

March 4, 2014

much more discussion on that topic.  I am comfortable with paragraph 6 in options that some of the SEP submissions may we are providing.  This is likely to provide less clarity than it highlights more work that needs to be done on the SEP.  Ideally, how we report Chair. need to have 1 through 3, and I would highlight one concern, which is not be consistent with the guidance desirable, and the SEP should be as consistent as possible with any guidance provided in the statement.  Thank you very much, Madam

Chair.  I would like to comment on broad as the substance of the statement.  I MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam communications tactics as regards forward guidance as well will respond to some of the questions as I proceed.

statement alone as our tool point I've made before in Committee meetings is that the Committee is a common decision, not necessarily a uniformly held rationale for decisions. to crafting the statement that treats it as a vehicle for communicating a statement, for our determination of the path of policy. First, I would caution against going too far in reliance on the to transmit guidance.  A designed to arrive at So I prefer an approach framework, or a general its own array of possible tactical devices are the Chair's press conference, the SEPs, the and general color or can draw attention to I see the statement as a device for implementing forward guidance as having a tactical role within a set of communications alternatives, each with uses.  These other communications minutes, the Chair's speeches and testimony, our collective speaking opportunities, and, maybe, other devices to be developed.  The use of these alternative communications vehicles can convey more information, appropriately qualified details, quantification in the SEP of elements of the statement.

a legitimate concern.  The principle of Committee As we move ahead to in good time with how to do all of as a package.  I can envision a checklist of sorts for might critical considerations changing policies. Proper governance, however, is ratification of the content of formal communications requires, it seems to me, a disciplined process around use of some of the alternative communications devices. refine our communications strategy, I'd like to see us wrestle this and deal with communications composing and updating a statement to convey a framework for policy decisions.  It include elements such as an assessment of progress toward qualitative goals, a projection of progress over a time horizon, a reference to a broad set of indicators, and in setting or

I have in mind.  I think it we view financial stability as distinct consideration, I would not be averse to language like that in option 4 on financial Of the five options presented, option 5 comes closest to what adequately covers the financial developments consideration, and if a stability per se .

on economic conditionality.  Reliance in the statement on qualitative I I believe the Committee is trying to avoid. A statement that serves to communicate a framework would almost of necessity rely qualitative measures of measures allows, in my mind, for interpretation elsewhere, particularly in press conferences. would, therefore, drop the use of thresholds, targets, or triggers.  I do not favor linking the timing of the first increase of the federal funds rate to the asset purchase program.  I view the winddown as likely to continue on the current track unless the economy deteriorates markedly.  This makes the terminal point of asset purchases fairly predictable.  Linking liftoff to the end of the asset purchase program introduces a date feature that time.  And I do not additional guidance on the path of the policy rate post-liftoff. I also do not favor introducing an inflation floor, at least not at this think it's necessary yet to introduce

I see misinterpretation of how near the liftoff date might be, so I would hold fire on to the existing The conditions for liftoff are still down the road, and I would prefer to assess and communicate our exit strategy with a clearer view of what conditions potential for additional post-liftoff guidance at this time.  However, I do not particularly object post-liftoff language.  Those are my comments.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

I suggest that our changes to the be minimalist and a little bit more qualitative, and at the same time maintain respect established under your predecessor. MR. FISHER.

in reverse order.  I wish to make the following points and then to make a Chair. memo, more or less suggestion, Madam ideal for the Committee to decide on a strategy for communicating that strategy to the proceed for two reasons.  First, private-sector expectations concerning economic criteria for removing accommodation in the post-liftoff that merely recites the dual mandate or repeats what is said in the Committee's Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy doesn't contribute much, and it to be an already overly long FOMC statement. To begin, I believe that it would be conducting post-liftoff monetary policy and also on a plan for public-through statements but also through our speeches, and particularly through your press conferences-either before or in conjunction with the new forward guidance on liftoff.  I think this is a sensible way to the post-liftoff conduct of policy influence current demand and, hence, the timing of liftoff. And, second, the appropriate period logically determine the appropriate criteria for liftoff.  I think a statement of broad principles Statement on Longer-run actually adds to what I consider

about paragraph 6 in options 1 the one that I have trouble with.  It that short-term interest rates are likely to remain unusually low for a time even after Unless we have a consensus as to likely to remain unusually low, and a consensus that these reasons are don't think that sentence should be included, and I wouldn't include the first paragraph 6. With regard to a point made by President Kocherlakota through 3 and paragraph 7 in option 4, that second sentence is states employment and inflation return to mandate-consistent levels. why short-term rates are important, I sentence in forward guidance, I spelled them out in a memo I sent around to our colleagues.  I would prefer a statement along the following lines-I'm 'The Committee intends to adjust its policy instruments so as As to my own preferences on post-liftoff that just going to repeat what I wrote:

March 4, 2014

the coming three to five years, and beyond, as as possible constant at 2 percent.  Realized inflation of a rate modestly higher than inflation at a rate modestly lower than 2 percent is acceptable if The Committee monetary policy conducted according to these principles will help households and in a manner to hold projections of average PCE inflation over nearly 2 percent is acceptable if accompanied by weaker-than-previously-projected real economic activity, and realized accompanied by stronger-than-previously-projected real economic activity. believes that firms plan their purchases and investments and manage their financial obligations that keeps employment near its maximum sustainable level.'

that financial developments, if not financial stability se issues I'd prefer a statement that meets the following to the existing language until we get this hammered out a able to do in this phone call. I do believe per , certainly need to be mentioned in a policy consideration.  And I conclude overall, with that background, that we are going to need some additional time to tackle thoughtfully and thoroughly the associated with post-liftoff guidance.  So for now criteria.  First, it does no harm.  Second, it keeps the door open to my preferred form of postliftoff guidance-of course, this is my preference.  And, third, except as necessary to accomplish those first two points, it keeps close little bit more thoroughly than I suspect we are to option 5, Madam in the second section, which begins with 'The Committee anticipates.'  I'm 'The Committee anticipates, based on its that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to funds rate at least as long as complete recovery in the labor a year away, and projected inflation is not above the So I come down to option 5.  I would make a slight amendment Chair, and that is just going to read what I would suggest here: assessment of these factors, ¼ percent target range for the federal market appears to be more than Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal'-in other words, I would strike the word 'especially.'

March 4, 2014

operative changes are inserting 'and,' striking 'is not above.' Those are my changes to that sentence.  The key 'especially if,' striking 'continues to run below,' and inserting think President Lockhart said, I would get rid of the next sentence ties liftoff of the federal funds rate to the asset purchase program, and I think President think that sentence is necessary.  And then I leave the last sentence that's now in blue by itself. In keeping with what I because it Lockhart made a very good point there.  I don't would basically

I would suggest we make.  Certainly, that's as much as I maintains longer-term inflation goal.  And it takes away specific date guidance So those are the changes that could support at this juncture.  I think it does provide us a bridge.  It's qualitative.  It respect for our 2 percent and also removes the numerical reference to unemployment.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Williams.

will make my own in spirit to President MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I actually find myself in complete agreement with the comments of President Rosengren.  Nevertheless, I comments, and I have my own version of paragraph 5, which is similar Rosengren's comments but, I think, is something that may be even a little simpler.

years to more ordinary statement should context of the to cover all possible issues and contingencies. As we move from the extraordinary times of the past several times, our policy statements and forward guidance should move away from numeric thresholds, triggers, and floors, as many people have already mentioned.  Instead, the provide a more qualitative explanation of our policy reaction function in the economic situation and our goals.  Over time, the statement should become shorter and should not try quantitative guidance, I think of the analogy of to Disneyland from Northern California-say, from In considering the qualitative versus giving someone instructions on how to get

Sacramento.  And the first part of it is, get on I -5, go south for several hours, and just keep going.  That's what I see as our threshold language of a 6½ percent unemployment rate, and I think that served us very well.  Eventually, you start going over the Grapevine, you come into Los Angeles, and you run into the massive not expect.  Obviously, there you have to use circumstances.  So any attempt to explain to somebody how you navigate through an area Los Angeles in a predetermined way is going to fail.  I goals, we are facing a choice to either say, 'Well, keep going on I -5 at full speed'-the danger with that is, you end up in Mexico-or try to explain all of the contingencies and the factors the thresholds that you should be following.  And it's better to framework, the reaction function, and not try to explain all of the public's between the end of our asset purchase program of funds rate liftoff; and, third, to provide a general contour of how we expect to see memo, in my view, try to do these three basic goals.  I think we can be clearer and more that of January but, at the same time, I see three primary goals of the March FOMC statement:  first, to reaffirm understanding of our policy approach and our plans-that is, keep policy expectations basically where they are today; second, to provide a bridge and the date policy in the post-liftoff period.  Many of the proposals in the staff too much, distracting attention from effective if we keep the statement language more similar to importantly, anchor interest rate expectations appropriately.

end, I have my own four-sentence version of paragraph 5, which I will read, like this:  'To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price that a highly accommodative stance of Toward this and it goes stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program

March 4, 2014

current range of 0 to ¼ percent for the fed funds actual and expected future progress of unemployment and toward their mandate-consistent levels.  This assessment will take into account a wide conditions, indicators of it will be appropriate to maintain the current range for the achieved, provided that inflation expectations continue to be well anchored and risks to financial stability I am also comfortable with including paragraph 6. ends.  In determining how long to maintain the rate, the Committee will consider inflation range of information, including various measures of labor market inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.  The Committee currently anticipates federal funds rate until significant further progress toward its goals is longer-term remain contained.'

interest rate expectations in three ways.  First, it retains and think Second, it states that we will maintain the funds rate at its current level until is achieved, and, of course, it makes reference to after liftoff. This approach anchors highlights the 'considerable time after the asset purchase program ends' phrasing, which I is important. significant further progress toward our goals both of our goals.  And, third, the inclusion of paragraph 6 should help anchor expectations about the path in the staff memo, paragraphs 2 to 4 of the FOMC in paragraph 5, in my view.  I would also mention at that about objectives or appropriate stance of policy, and, in thinking about you want to realize that that whole set-up is around asset purchases.  So, in my with a reference to the end of asset purchases. Now, regarding the questions statement already discuss the general principles of our approach to policy, so we don't really need to restate the general approach point that it's important in thinking about paragraph 5 to reread paragraphs 2 through 4.  There is a lot of discussion there paragraph 5, view, you want to start paragraph 5

March 4, 2014

developments, I think the current discussion in the FOMC that has already been made, we want to be avoid the appearance that we have a particular target for asset prices in mind. With respect to financial statement, the very brief mention of it, is appropriate and encompasses consideration of financial-stability issues.  And, to repeat a comment careful to

In my view, this approach would preserve the presenting the full set of SEP submissions, which gives you the full range of views of 19 participants but, importantly, would give would provide hard numbers to reinforce the message in the statement.

It simply is key for maintaining the necessary high degree of Furthermore, as noted by the staff, market with the FOMC views on how policy is likely to evolve, and I agree with the principle that we don't want our new statement to alter that view.  So I am in favor of forward guidance in the monetary accommodation as we go forward.

Any changes to the forward guidance in our FOMC statement should be consistent number of uncontroversial key elements.  First, our guidance to our January 2012 Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy our clear intention to meet our dual-mandate goals in a should repeatedly ask if our policy formulation is consistent with second element.  We should mention both sides of our dual mandate and inflation. This takes me to the prominently in the guidance-both the real side

an inflation agree with the Kocherlakota on this.  Our policy commentary should be construed with convincing to the public that 2 percent is not a ceiling for inflation. Third, central bankers, in general, have difficulty acknowledging that objective should be evaluated symmetrically around its long-run goal.  I comments of President sufficient care to be overall stance of monetary policy is characterized by both the current settings after its Fourth, the and the entire expected path for our policy tools.  This means that our guidance should include commentary that adequately captures our future policy intentions for the funds rate initial liftoff from zero.

most drawn to option 5, which contains the smallest for not lifting rates, as 2 percent, to be workable and acceptable.  With regard to the mandate, I personally like using highly explicit conditional criteria in our reducing the unemployment threshold is off the table. With these elements in mind, and considering the history of the Committee's discussions on the subject of forward guidance, I'm changes to the January forward guidance.  I find its conditional guidance long as projected inflation is under employment side of the forward guidance.  However, I know that I also recognize that the somewhat unusual behavior of the unemployment rate of late suggests

That's still that inflation is going to increase very quickly, and I don't think it's going to very soon.  But if it did and the unemployment rate was at 6½ percent, or little bit above, I think a balanced approach calls for patience in adjusting our funds rate, forward guidance is helpful in that regard. The other options seem to have more challenges, in my opinion.  In the abstract, I drawn to the threshold for the employment.  However, I don't have operationalize it well.  If anyone has then I'd be interested But, in my opinion, option 3 alone lacks sufficient real-side important.  I doubt increase to 2 percent just a and having both of them in the

modifications, I think it could be workable.  The most important attribute in this formulation, for me, is the description market guideline-that is, 'at least as long as complete recovery in the labor market clever and is broadly consistent with many ways a labor market threshold.  For example, if the unemployment rate a little bit below that, I might expect that 5½ percent unemployment is to my policy intention, as I would expect it to be line with the January 2012 longer-run goals statement.  It also allows for a wide conditionality test-employment levels, and labor force participation rates relative to trends, and hiring So I tend to prefer option 5.  With some very small reasonably of the labor appears to be more than a year away.'  This is one might want to formulate fell to 6 percent, or even in reach within a year-maybe.  It gets closer formulated in array of labor market data to be included in the employment-to-population ratios

Lastly, a description of the post-liftoff path for short-term interest could be enhanced in one of the various paragraph 6 options, as in paragraph 6 of option 3-that fits nicely.

Thank you, Madam Chair.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you, President Evans.  Vice President Weinberg, who is substituting for President Lacker.

Chair.  It's clearly an opportune and appropriate MR. WEINBERG.  Thank you, Madam time to modify forward guidance, given the approaching 6½ percent unemployment threshold. At the moment, there doesn't seem to be much of a case for trying to significantly shift market

March 4, 2014

to be pretty expectations for the path of short-term interest rates, as market expectations appear well aligned with the Committee's center of gravity as displayed in the SEP, for example.

The Committee has really not spent raise rates for the first time.  On this, there is probably a wide range of views around One of the key questions in thinking about what to communicate is how to describe conditions that would lead to an initial interest rate increase. much time discussing the economic conditions that, for each participant, would likely trigger wanting to the table.  Accordingly, anything more than a fairly minimalist approach could be premature at this point.  Trying to articulate something more precise involves implicitly staking out the conceptual framework, and more discussions about the framework might be useful before doing so.

read as follows:  'The Committee anticipates, based on its maintain the current 0 to ¼ target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase This eliminates the clause 'at least as long as complete recovery in the labor this a 'hyper-minimalist Our preference would be for a streamlined version of option 5 in which the third and fourth sentences are combined to assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to percent program ends.' market appears to be more than a year away, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal.'  You could call approach.'

'complete recovery' language in option 5 is intentionally less specific, and that consensus statement of 2012, While the is appealing in some regards, I think that people seeing that language are naturally going to want to map it to a specific unemployment rate or an employment-to-population ratio or some other metric.  Using a phrase like 'complete recovery' or 'maximum sustainable level of employment' in this context seems to go beyond the Committee's

March 4, 2014

and which emphasizes its variability.  Granted, the consensus statement goes on to cite it never actually that concept with the maximum level of employment.  In the current context, pivoting threshold to a formulation that refers to 'maximum sustainable level risks looking opportunistic, as if the Committee is responding to the fall in the which states that 'the maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors' participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, but equates from an unemployment rate of employment' unemployment rate by shifting to other labor market indicators.

Or would they conclude financial market developments ought to enter into the monetary policy role of financial-stability considerations more problems than it solves.  Here again, further deliberations by the Committee Finally, we're against including market developments.  Aside from one would want to single out for special consideration the developments for our goals, compared with the full array of factors Further, the creates some difficulties.  Would people conclude that employment and inflation objectives that large asset price increases would induce tighter monetary policy, or that large asset price declines would induce easier policy?  Might they conclude that the Committee would ease policy in response to distress at one or more large financial institutions?  Without a shared understanding of how reaction function, communicating to the public about the could create on the relevant conceptual framework could be fruitful before expanding the dimensions of Committee communications further.

most likely lead to liftoff for the pace of adjustment after liftoff. MS. PIANALTO.  As today's discussion demonstrates, the communication challenges before us are significant.  In my view, we face two broad challenges.  The first, and more pressing, challenge is communicating the conditions that will federal funds rate.  The second is communicating the likely is simpler to address than the second, although I'm not sure, after the date-based guidance and then with the unemployment thresholds for liftoff, highlight the importance of proceeding cautiously with very broad the timing of liftoff-and then take some time over the spring and The first challenge today's conversation, that it's going to be quite that simple.  But I do believe that our experiences, first with the fed funds rate changes to our forward guidance.  For now, I suggest that the Committee focus on addressing the first challenge-that is, summer to study and discuss the efficacy of approaches to guidance on the pace of adjustment after liftoff.

would be most the forward guidance to simply refer to labor market conditions in broad terms will to improve gradually, and the inflation forecast is likely to be the key driver in the to an inflation floor, the formal establishment of an inflation large change in our approach. To address the communications challenges around liftoff, in my view, it effective to revise and to establish an explicit inflation floor.  In my economic outlook, the labor market continue timing of liftoff.  In addition, since the current statement language has an inflation ceiling and other wording that comes close floor wouldn't represent a large change in guidance or a

March 4, 2014

options circulated to the Committee, I view option 5 as the best Committee will consider in deciding on liftoff.  However, I believe that option 5 to 'at least as long as complete recovery in the labor market appears to is that the Committee is likely to have difficulty in clearly defining a complete around the LSAP labor it might be problematic is that such guidance would imply that the the labor market at least one year in unemployment rate over the last for careful study one year before the labor market recovery is Of the forward-guidance starting point because it provides continuity with the current statement and includes the full range of factors that the the reference in be more than a year away' could prove to be problematic.  One reason that it could be problematic recovery in labor markets, just as we had some trouble with the guidance program that referred to a simpler notion of substantial improvement in the outlook for the market.  A second reason that Committee can accurately predict complete recovery in advance, even though the simpler exercise of forecasting the two years has been difficult.  And a third reason is that we haven't had the time of the efficacy of waiting to raise rates until just complete.

reasons, I would prefer a version of option 5 modified to drop the reference to second sentence of option 3.  The inflation forecast will to determine liftoff, but they are more difficult to spell the forward guidance.  When you look at the December SEP, it suggests 2 percent inflation floor would also be generally consistent with the Committee and policy views.  Based on the limited information available in the as though the liftoff for many participants was being driven more by an than by the unemployment threshold. For these complete recovery in labor markets, and, in place of that language, I would insert the inflation floor language that's provided in the capture many of the factors that are likely out in simple terms in that using a participants' forecasts December SEP, it looks inflation forecast

Committee.  Regarding whether to include a general statement on policy decisions, I it would be helpful to include the guidance that is provided in the second and the last option 5.  I think any further general statement that the Committee wishes to make Monetary Policy for linking liftoff to LSAPs, I believe that the statement language should preserve current statement.   To do otherwise might suggest a shift in So, with those general comments, let me very quickly turn to the questions that were posed to the believe that sentences of would best be presented in the annual Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Strategy.  As the guidance that's provided in the our policy position.  Regarding thresholds, triggers, and floors, as I just stated, I would prefer forward guidance that includes an inflation floor.

Instead, as I've indicated, I'd prefer to focus now on The Committee can take time again over the spring and summer to study and discuss the adjustment after liftoff.

I think, the significant communications challenge that we face in about the various and consequences, I gravitated to minimal changes at this rather than introducing new benchmarks sense of the future path of short-term rates.  To that our March statement, including the while leaning on other think that will pose some mean by that. This exercise highlights, the transition from unconventional aspects of our policy.  So, as I thought options and the related implications point, continuing to simplify and clarify where possible or thresholds to describe the Committee's end, I would support language along the lines of option 5 for alternative drafted by President Plosser and sent out earlier, communications vehicles to elaborate.  And I want to also join in with those who have expressed concern within option 5 about that language of 'complete recovery.'  I challenges in explaining what we to our existing strategy statement and the SEP.  I continue to think the Statement on to its policy decisions.  The statement is clear, I think, that we account for deviations of assessment of its considering risk to the financial system.  It also explains the balanced are not complementary and describes that FOMC statements with further In terms of the first and third questions, I would offer two thoughts on forward guidance relative Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy provides a good depiction of the Committee's approach inflation from its long-run goal and deviations of employment from our maximum level while approach we intend to pursue when these objectives we account for the balance of risk when setting policy.  So this statement is an important complement to forward guidance, and I would not muddy future

March 4, 2014

to be either redundant or attempts to explain our approach to monetary strategy, since it's likely confusing.

the SEP in providing guidance on the path of rates after liftoff.  The SEP, despite its the economy.  Unlike static dates or thresholds or other quantifications, which can move intentions, the rate projections move in response to economic developments, providing information on reason, I continue to believe by moving median projections of the funds rate into the FOMC statement. In addition to leaning on our existing strategy statement, we should not underweight value of the noted shortcomings, offers an ongoing and consistent framework that currently communicates the intention of Committee participants to keep the funds rate at an unusually low level to support in unpredictable ways that don't always align well with our policy in the SEP over time will how policy will vary with economic conditions after liftoff.  For this that we could leverage the existing communication provided by the SEP to convey our future intentions raised is whether the median should reflect all or only voting members.  And because the submissions today are not identified, I'm this is an issue just in theory or in reality.  But a reference by the FOMC to the described minutes at each submission.  Of course, in addition to these two vehicles, minutes can assist importantly with the heavy lifting of One issue, of course, that's been participants not sure whether SEP would not be without precedent.  SEP medians are referenced today in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, and they're visibly attached to and as part of the FOMC the press conferences and FOMC communicating our policy intentions.

question 2, on a more prominent role for financial developments, I tend to on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy already references I could support including a sentence along the lines of that offered in option 4. In terms of think that our Statement this.  But

March 4, 2014

theme that Dennis introduced, and several people have echoed it since that, particularly as we pass the 6.5 percent threshold, we're better advised to the FOMC statement, which can be elaborated upon elaboration, particularly, though not exclusively, think it becomes particularly here, Chair. MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I'll make a few comments here.  First-and I think this picks up on a then-I do believe have somewhat generally stated standards in as circumstances dictate.  I might deviate a bit from what Dennis stated in expressing a strong bias in favor of having the Chair do most of that in the press conferences that she'll be conducting.  To the degree that we think of communication of forward guidance as itself an element of monetary policy, I important to have an authoritative voice elaborating that position, and there's no alternative really, but the standards, I do think important that we not lose the advantage of what we've gotten already in the language that the notion that we are the time when we pass a unemployment rate.  And, second, as we begin to increase interest rates, we will, to It might be advisable to substitute in that language something that makes mention of-and I'm not sure this is the A second point is, although I've got, personally, a fair amount of flexibility on the specific language that we will adopt, consistent with that notion of general it's we've inserted into the existing paragraph 5.  One of those things is likely-not certain, but likely-to stay at the zero lower bound well past 6½ percent use our euphemism, 'take a balanced approach.' 'balanced approach'

March 4, 2014

those give a justification for why prejudging right term-the headwinds that we'll be confronting, because we think the path upward is, again, not likely to be steep, although we're not anything.

note in passing that, although I've got a fair amount of flexibility on the option 2 rather than in really am less concerned with that.  I would say, though, that I think there's a bit of a as our standard becomes a bit circular.  That is, it almost is the conclusion being and employment is going target, and that's your projection, then, almost by definition, you're going to be in of I say that with the understanding that we already use as we go forward here and in other I would just language and, in some respects, I like some of the earlier statements in option 5, I risk here.  Not many people have proposed it, but there's a bit of a risk that too much reliance on projections stated as the standard.  If you think inflation is going to be below target to be below favor of a longer period of accommodation, and you're in favor of it because of your expectation that that's where we're going to be.  So I'm not sure it communicates an enormous amount information very effectively, but projections and we're going to continue to use projections parts of the statement.

and, second, some indication of how steep a climb we'll have once we begin. the benefits of the communications we've had to they are.  We haven't yet said I, like several of you, find paragraph 6 in a few of thinking about we haven't had a debate on that, and it may be The next point is that what we've got now is, first, some indication of when we'll begin to raise rates That's where, I think, we don't want to lose date, and we want to keep market expectations about where anything about the endpoint, and this is where the options attractive, because it does state an endpoint.  And it seems to me it's an endpoint that, while not giving a specific number, communicates something about how we'll be policy along the way.  Richard is quite right that

March 4, 2014

a little bit concerned about taking and sometime thereafter we'll talk about the endpoint.  I think it's three-again, in somewhat generally stated standards-and elaborate after listening to the whole Committee during the quarterly that it would be premature to adopt it.  But, unlike Sandy, I'm it one step at a time.  Let's just say when we're going to begin, and sometime later we'll talk about how steep a climb, preferable to say something about all then allow the Chair to meetings that are followed by press conferences.

It would be of it.  And a simple minimalist financial-stability considerations would be just fine, from my point of view, but I With respect to the financial-stability point, I think Jim had it just right. useful to make reference to it, but not to make too big a deal reference to don't feel very strongly about that.

agree with what I think is the somewhat emergent consensus, a basic minimalist approach.  But with respect to the this is one for which I happily give you my proxy so that, as you try to In conclusion, Madam Chair, I would stay away, as much as possible, from projections being the basis for the standards.  I with a lot of variation-that we go with specific language, allocate the votes, you've got an extra one just to lean in whatever direction you think useful.

take to be mass of where the Committee sees the appropriate path.  Like many others, again, I to do no harm, and to remember that we've got considerable FOMC statement-for the guidance, both in your credibility on that if we just keep the LSAPs going until CHAIR YELLEN.  Thanks-much appreciated, Governor Tarullo.  Governor Stein. MR. STEIN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Let me start with a few premises-three, in particular-and then I'll comment on the options.  One, as several others have observed, is that we're basically in a good place.  Market expectations are roughly lined up with what I the center of think it's good not to 'overtinker,' support-beyond what's in the this issue and in the LSAP timing factor, which is

March 4, 2014

end of 2014, it's hard for people to envision a world in which we lift off before midneed to overdo it in the statement. roughly the 2015.  This suggests not feeling the is, I think we want to begin thinking about all of this in terms of a we will want to communicate more normal world.  Then we should ask, is what we're setting up now going to converge Or are we setting up a bunch of one-offs, tests regarding may have to awkwardly So that's the second consideration. The second point transition back to a more normal world and asking ourselves how in that smoothly to that desired end state? certain variables, that are helpful and serve a purpose now but we dismantle later on?

The collective view is that the right time-consistent rate is below what a naive may ultimately converge back to doing a Taylor rule, but we need a coherent narrative that both takes us there and, in the process of getting to where we want to be now, we don't if the news comes in a little bit good-when somebody you should be doing this.  Why aren't you doing it?'  In this spirit, one asymmetry induced by the zero lower bound and the fact that, in a world of Chair, that you mentioned at the outset, and it surprises me that we're not little bit more advantage of it.  I think it's a nice bit of logic.  If you lean on it a little bit special factors and data idiosyncrasies, which may work for The third thing-and this is something that Narayana pointed out-is that there's a clear challenge: application of a Taylor rule would seem to suggest.  We something like ideally, self-liquidates.  That is, leave ourselves with a lot of junk DNA in the statement.  At the same time, we have to have a strong, coherent explanation-especially says, 'Hey, Taylor says observation is the uncertainty, it's just time consistent and rational to wait a little bit longer as a result of that uncertainty, because, if you get a little bit behind, you can always raise, but if you raise prematurely, you can't undo that.  This is something that's missing from all of the options, and it's something, Madam taking a more, you have to lean less on other

March 4, 2014

that to be a little bit of a lesson from Carney's as though it was going to get you somewhere, and then it that.  I like the fact that it's a self-liquidating thing.  It has a logic now that just away as we normalize. now but then may not work later.  And I take adventure with 7 percent.  It seemed didn't.  So I like pulls more use of this asymmetry.  Now, whether it belongs in the in the press conference, I don't have a strong view.  It may well be that think it's worth maybe having folks work up a one of these like 'In determining how long to maintain'-blah, blah, blah-'the Committee will take motivation this rules for waiting until the recovery is well that in any option that you like.  And again, I I think one could make statement as opposed to it's better off not being in the statement.  I sentence and see if it writes itself well.  I'd just throw out something somewhere in options into account the asymmetry created by the zero lower bound and the added creates relative to traditional monetary policy established.'  So one could use something like think it takes a little bit of the lean, then, off of some of the other stuff.

In terms of the options themselves, like many of the others, I'm attracted to the Sandy and a couple of others, there is a sentence concerns me.  The sentence contains the phrase 'at least as long as complete recovery labor market appears to be more than a year away.'  I read this as very threshold-like in its we used for the threshold-'at least as long as remains above 6½ percent.'  So I worry that if you say that, people are out what that means.  What are the indicators that tell you what is?  And when will you know that it's a year away?  Then we'll get drawn little bit of the same kind of numbers game.  I would be quite comfortable with option 5 if little clause with something we've had before-'for a considerable time All right. simplicity and continuity of option 5.  But, like that really in the language.  It has very much the formulation that the unemployment rate going to ask you to call 'complete recovery' into a we could replace that

March 4, 2014

zero-lower-bound stuff.  But, read that as threshold-like.  Even though there's not a number in there, I feel as though ponying up what your metrics are.  So that's than that, I think something along the lines of option 5 works well. after the asset purchase program ends.'  If one felt that that didn't do enough or wasn't strong enough, I would be happy with something along the lines of the again, I it'll put you in a position of really having to start my concern.  But other Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Powell. CHAIR

some variant of option 5 is of the other the preceding options. MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I, too, think that the right place to land, and I'll talk about that.  But I want to talk first about a couple issues that arise in think it market as a significant signal, and the signal would probably as a measure.  But we are market that idea. First, I am not attracted to the idea of switching to an employment type of goal.  I would certainly be perceived by the be along the lines of losing confidence in the unemployment rate already saying in the postmeeting statement that we are looking at a variety of labor measures, and, therefore, I think it might be confusing, and, in the end, doesn't buy us a lot.  So I'm not attracted to

the point of the thresholds that are in option 2 and option 4 to be to set up some brakes on in the form of a link to the end I realize we are mixing state dependence and I think this is really the ballast that is holding market expectations Turning to the pre-liftoff guidance, I am not attracted, again, to the new thresholds.  And I take this locomotive against unwanted tightening if the economy does strengthen again.  But, in my view, we have already got effective brakes-and, for me, that is of asset purchases.  Specifically, monetary policy will remain highly accommodative for a considerable time after the end of asset purchases. time dependence there, but

March 4, 2014

to where the Committee is.  I think this is a very important fundamental aspect.  It's to the market's understanding, and I think it would be very it at this time. close working right now and is central unwise to change recovery in the labor market as a threshold, in If you look at what we know of the Scandinavian countries or the long history the labor market in a lot of cases.  So it's I'll come to this in the end, but complete particular-you know, you think about those words and we may never have that, if you take it literally.  Right? of crises, there is permanent damage in some respect to not a great formulation, in my view.

'considerable time' sentence is linked to the highly monetary policy, which the memo points out is kind of ambiguous on I'm actually okay with either formulation, and, frankly, I think consistent with and in sync with the December SEP. Now, the current formulation of the accommodative stance of its face.  But I strongly suspect that what many in the market interpret that to mean is the current target for the federal funds rate. that either formulation is this into one proposed sentence, is that as we pass the unemployment rate and the threshold language drops away, we lose, especially if I think all of those thoughts in one sentence and come out with something like this, which 'The Committee anticipates that it likely will be appropriate to I think President Williams managed stability' into that sentence, too, and I wouldn't object to that. A final point, and I'm going to put 6.5 percent projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal. you can put would land in paragraph 5: maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economy strengthens, particularly if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-term goal.' to squeeze 'financial

March 4, 2014

in here-and I hate to complicate this even further-is open the question of reinvestment of the assets on the balance sheet.  I don't synchronous with liftoff.  So this is the time to think about whether we wouldn't resolve that we will maintain our reinvestment policy and as it exists at the end of the asset purchase program until that out, there's a suggestion that we forgot it. On a separate point, what's not that we have left think we have said anything publicly about it since 2011, and at that point I think we were saying we would cease reinvestments six months before liftoff.  I think in the previous Tealbook, it was actually that question and use this occasion, or an occasion soon, to say what we're going to do about that.  In other words, we would indicate preserve the size of the balance sheet liftoff, or something like that.  If we leave the more explicit formulations.  I could live with ones in paragraph 4. In terms of financial stability, I like either of the

is concerned, I like paragraph 6.  It is pretty much fine an explanation of why.  As someone pointed out, it inflation, and we are going to have a 2 percent funds rate.  That, I think, to the press conference, and, therefore, I am going to jump ahead and say what I it's an asymmetrical situation and we need to get as far away from the zero lower bound as I would also personally emphasize that the output gap is not time.  And I believe that, today, size of the gap is unusually high and is probably skewed in a way that to understate the real resource gap.  Finally, I As far as post-liftoff guidance with me.  What it doesn't have, of course, is just flatly states what the SEP already says, which is that we're going to be at full employment with mandate-consistent clearly falls would say in the press conference.  First I'd mention the headwinds, deleveraging, lack of credit availability, that kind of thing.  I would also make the risk-management point that Jeremy made, that possible before easing off the gas. directly observable and famously difficult to estimate in real uncertainty about the indicators, like the unemployment gap, are likely

YELLEN.  Thank you, Governor Powell.  And last but not least, Vice Chairman CHAIR Dudley.

DUDLEY.  Thank you, Chair Yellen.  It is great to have the VICE CHAIRMAN opportunity to work with you as Chair.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.

DUDLEY.  I want to first start by answering the questions and then make a few general observations, given the discussion that we've had.  In terms of the am very much where most people are.  I'd prefer a qualitative approach rather than a It seems to me that the goal of the statement is to describe our VICE CHAIRMAN I'll questions, I quantitative approach. expectations about the outlook and then our likely reaction function not just to that outlook but to other possible outlooks, so people can sort of think along with us.

is such a link, and it's highly unlikely that we are going to start to raise the short-term Should we link the liftoff explicitly to the end of asset purchases?  I think the answer is yes.  There funds rate before we end asset purchases.  So why not be explicit about that?

like thresholds, triggers, or floors.  I think they are both too complicated and too in the sense that we then have to articulate why we picked they are too specific in the sense that as the may not want to be governed so specifically by the particular I don't specific.  They are too complicated that particular threshold, trigger, or floor; information set changes, we threshold, trigger, or floor that we chose.  The world is, obviously, more complicated than that,

March 4, 2014

the case of the 6½ percent unemployment rate, and we saw that in the case of threshold. and we see that in the Bank of England's 7 percent unemployment rate thresholds, triggers, and floors that are tied to forecasts.  What And how does the market react to forecast changes?  Say we to two-year time horizon of 1.6 percent and then we moved it to also think if we tie our actions to our make the flawed SEP process even more important and introduce the potential submissions could actually be used policy outcomes directly.  I think it would be really unfortunate if we got into that I particularly don't like happens if the forecasts are wrong? had inflation on a one1.9 percent.  How would the market respond to that?  I forecasts, it would for gaming in terms of SEP submissions where the forecast to drive the sort of situation.

having a sentence referencing financial market developments is welcome, but are important.  The first issue is second is financial stability, so it The fact is, if financial conditions are grossly different monetary policy, so we need to take that I agree that I strongly prefer financial market developments to financial stability because I think the topic of financial market developments emits two separate issues that deviations of financial conditions from what we expect, and the includes two very different concepts. from what we anticipate, this does have implications for into consideration.

trajectory of interest rates after liftoff, the terminal level of the funds rate, because I think that is an important of financial conditions.  Bond yields and equity prices today depend on what is in terms of the time of liftoff, but where short-term rates go over the post-liftoff guidance implies that all that matters is the time if we don't include it now, I very much prefer providing guidance about the both the gradient and determinant going to happen not just medium to longer term.  Leaving out you lift off.  The other problem, I think, in not including it now is that

March 4, 2014

in this position of, when do we introduce it?  And is going to be a really big market event.  So if we're going to revamp the statement, now is a to do it, with a new Chair.  Let's get this into the statement now, because it will much easier to keep it in the statement going forward.  In general, I think the statement to be revamped now for several reasons.  The 6½ percent unemployment rate threshold is timing is right with the new Chair.  If we don't alter it in March, it would more significant change if we were to revamp it later.  So this is actually a meaningful changes to the statement. and liftoff gets closer, then we are going to be that perfect time make it needs stale, and I think the just make it a much singular opportunity to make what I'm for, I am generally inclined to a more minimalist approach, along changes.  One, as someone observed, it does seem like it has a threshold in there, need a paragraph 6 to what happens to the trajectory of interest rates after liftoff.  In terms of other changes, I should put the punchline up-front, to be raised until a considerable time after the end of asset that coming first, rather than burying the lead. In terms of the lines of either option 1 or 5.  If we went down the route of an option 5, I would want to have two sorts of and I'm a little uncomfortable with that.  And, two, I really do think we explain think President Williams made a suggestion that maybe we that short-term rates aren't going purchases.  I like

least consider the idea of being more explicit in the statement by market expectations.  I'm not really sure how to with its earlier dateit is going to be firmer if you have that in than if you just defer it to the press conference.  If you decide not to include it in important that it be discussed at the press conference. I think we should at saying that the changes are not designed to shift do that.  But if you remember, in December 2012 when we shifted to an unemployment rate threshold, we said, 'The Committee views these thresholds as consistent based guidance.'  And I thought that was good because the statement the statement, I think it is extremely

March 4, 2014

think the press conference is extremely important.  In addition to making it clear that we trying to alter expectations, I think we want to explain in the press conference why the linking the interest rate liftoff to the end of asset purchases because that is how the think it's important to provide guidance.  I think we need to to people a little bit more that we're providing long-term guidance on the path of shortbecause it's important for financial conditions.  I don't think we have really articulated degree that we need to.  And I think, in the press conference, you could explain a important as well. I are not statement needed to be changed, the staleness of the 6½ percent unemployment rate, and the importance of Committee is thinking about that.  I explain term rates it to the full little bit more why financial market developments are made a good suggestion about reinvestments.  Our last statement would likely begin the process of normalization by ceasing like that has been hanging out there as something that, you know, clearly We are not going to want to cease reinvestments six months before when six months before is.  So I think we should really correcting that as well.  Thank you, Madam Chair. I think Governor Powell about this in 2011 indicated that we reinvestments.  I feel doesn't apply any more. liftoff, because we are not going to know try to think about

Thanks, everybody.  I think we've had a really rich discussion, and the staff's task to work with me to see takes many of the comments into account. CHAIR YELLEN. you have made a lot of truly helpful comments.  It will be if we can figure out something that lines of option 5, a the valuable suggestions you've given and come I have heard a considerable amount of interest in something along the more minimalist approach building on what we have, but with many suggested changes to what we offered up.  We will try hard to think about back to you early next week with some proposals for your reaction to see if we can converge by the time of the meeting.  But I appreciate very much everyone's input today.

[No response] We are running perhaps first of all, are there any other final questions or comments on forward guidance anyone would like to opine, I think we have a couple of minutes if Seeing none, then, let me give you an opportunity, if you have any questions about Ukraine and want to take that up and get Steve anyone wants to make a comment or ask a question about developments there.  [No response] Okay.  Seeing none, I guess it is time to wrap up.

is sufficiently us in a better place in could attract support in March.  And I think we have learned a of your input. We are beating our estimated time by a considerable amount.  I appreciate all of you making time to do this.  I know it was last minute, but I really thought this complex that having a go-round and hearing your views would really put terms of designing options that lot, so thanks so much for all
