YELLEN.  Thank you so much.  Before we go to questions, there is one item I measure, as of yesterday at 5:00, the Board's the intermeeting period was up 20 basis points over past two meetings.  Since the October-November meeting, it's up 29 basis points.  The fiveis also up 21 basis points. CHAIR wanted to mention.  Simon noted during his presentation that the inflation compensation has moved up quite a bit.  According to the Board's five-year, five-year-forward measure over the year inflation compensation in the intermeeting period of in the five-year, five-year-forward measure.  So, seeing that, I asked the include in the alternative B that we'll discuss tomorrow and that Thomas will distribute I asked him to bracketed proposed statement language that would recognize this fact. Now, in recent years, the Committee's postmeeting statement has noted every move 20 basis points or more staff to either later today or it may be tomorrow morning-I did want to warn you that include some

to think about this, let me tell you explicitly what the new language will be.  Currently, at the end of paragraph 1, the language in alt-B 'Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low.  Survey-based measures of expectations are little changed, on balance.'  And the new proposed in recent expectations are little the proposed changes we'll see in to questions for Simon or Lorie.  President Evans. So, just to give you time proposed statement reads longer-term inflation language would read 'Market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased months but remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation changed, on balance.'  So I wanted to let you know about alt-B and give you a chance to think about it before we discuss it tomorrow morning. Let me now open the floor applied MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Somewhat related to that point, Simon, on chart 7 on exhibit 2, I think I missed the punchline or the discussion.  So the average

rate-so the five-year, five-year looks like it's CPI.  So if I take some off of that for the PCE, it looks like that's coming in under 6 years to 10 years in the future.  What's the story there?  Or is there point estimate of annual average CPI inflation 2.05 for the 2 percent-that's inflation, a story?

2016 U.S. election, you saw an increase in inflation increase in inflation compensation markets.  This time we've seen an increase in inflation compensation, which is past few months, we've seen no change in the average estimates that's consistent with other evidence, which is from surveys. the past reflected in the surveys that we MR.

And But inflation compensation is something like 70 to 80 basis points above its lows over two years.  So it's been a pretty big move, which is just not look at.

Okay.  Thank you. MR. EVANS.

The is intended to idea that it takes time for inflation to respond fully to movements in The staff's starting point for thinking augmented Phillips curve, an example of which is given by equation 1 on slide 1.

this framework, permanent changes in expected inflation eventually pass actual inflation.  In addition, if expectations are perfectly generate only inflation.  To better understand the role of anchored expectations in the staff's framework, it is useful to compare our baseline with an alternative model, commonly referred to as an 'accelerationist' In through one-for-one into anchored, transitory supply shocks and temporary changes in slack will short-term movements in inflation model Phillips curve.  An example is given by equation 2 on slide 2.

The assumption that that implies that even transitory shocks permanent imprint on inflation, as change in inflation is eventually reflected in the proxy for expectations.

In particular, the Great permanent imprint on inflation's long-run trend.  In broad terms, movements seen in measures of long-run expected inflation appear to roughly parallel long-run trend. as the estimated long-run trend.  Hence, in providing a structural characterization of inflation dynamics, we see the inflation expectations and use the observed behavior of expectations to inform our judgmental estimate of trend inflation in the Tealbook projection.

framework, however, leaves unresolved a number of issues that are explaining and forecasting inflation.  One issue, discussed in slide 4, is inflation expectations and how they are formed.  As I just noted, inflation element of the framework that we employ to analyze inflation inflation expectations.  For example, evidence that long-run expected and, in addition, the idea has models, one can find a role for survey inflation, but most of the identification comes from the mid-1990s. The current relevant for the role of expectations are a key developments.  However, several concerns are associated with how we use and forecast inflation drives actual inflation is largely circumstantial weak theoretical support.  In empirical inflation measures of long-run expected the period before that economic theory does not clearly identify which inflation measures should be most informative for inflation-the ones of forecasters, or expectation measures derived TIPS.  Because inflation expectations have generally been so stable recently, impossible. Another concern is expectation households, businesses, professional from constructing a meaningful empirical model of expectations-and identifying how they are determined-has become essentially

Empirically, the Phillips curve appears relatively flat at present. of the Phillips curve and the noise in the inflation data imply that price is not very informative about resource utilization.  The staff could be natural rate of unemployment because some other measure of resource utilization, such as the shortor real marginal costs, is the appropriate one for analyzing could also be wrong about the current or prospective inflation to slack.  For example, the relationship between slack and Another central question is noted in slide 5-namely, what is the inflation The flatness inflation mismeasuring slack-say, because our estimate of the is wrong or term unemployment rate inflation behavior.

For example, a comparison of lines in the chart reveals that time-varying estimates of the slack diverge after the Great Recession and depend on whether the included in the inflation the red line.  The reason appears to be that, in unemployment rate remaining rate. Another complicating factor, considered in sample used in particular, those associated with importantly the red and black coefficient noticeably relatively small category of financial services prices is measure, the black line, or excluded, the aftermath of the recession, the price index for these services was increasing much faster than its average pre-recession rate, despite the well above its natural inflation lack thereof, played by wages.  Labor decisions.  In the aggregate, labor two-thirds of firms' total production costs, and economic theory that increases in labor costs in excess of productivity gains should put that in recent years.  Hence, the staff tends to take little direct from movements in wages. Slide 7 notes two additional issues associated with the staff's price framework.  The first is the role, or apparent costs should be very important for firms' pricing costs represent about suggests upward pressure on prices.  Empirically, however, we find little evidence independent movements in average labor costs have had a material effect on aggregate price inflation signal for price behavior

unexplained movements in inflation is another question reflect an incorrect assessment fundamental factor that is real time. Finally, how to interpret with which we often struggle.  Such movements might of the effects of fundamental factors, the influence of a missing from our model, idiosyncratic price shocks, or simple noise.

all the uncertainties regarding the staff's inflation analysis, we cannot rule influences at play that will hold down inflation more persistently anticipating.  Some of these are listed on slide 9.  One potential influence While plausible, this possibility is hard to square with the trend in labor's share of income-which is often attributed to to be consistent with competition in recent years.

draw on the large body of research on forecasting to provide some perspective on these issues.  I will first present a of the model.  I will then report estimates of a specific version of the In my part of the presentation, I will inflation simple, general forecasting model and summarize the established research findings on the components

to shed some light on recent inflation, its trend, and long-run inflation discussing the importance of model uncertainty, I will finish model expectations.  After then up with a brief summary.

commonly considered in the forecasting literature take the relate inflation, long-run economic drivers, denoted by inflation and its trend.  The idea behind the model is that inflation contains a slow-moving trend component dissipate, inflation its trend.  This general model is closely related to the one Katia described. The inflation models form shown on page 10 of the handout in equation (1).  These models denoted by the letter π, to a time -varying measure of trend inflation or inflatio n expectations, denoted by π*; a set of X , that typically include measures of economic activity; and past basic and a cyclical component.  Over time, as cyclical influences reverts to sizable, judgmental forecasts.  But forecasts have generally been most of the 1970s and 1980s.  Although forecast than those observed during expansion, they are similar in size to the errors of a decade.  While the average size of component of the model-the forecast error-hasn't changed very size of the predictable component captured by the model's explanatory with regard to recent frustrations with inflation Historically, the errors of forecasts obtained with these models have been but so have the errors of more accurate since 1990 than for errors of the past several years appear modestly larger much of the 2001-07 economic the 1990s.  That said, the variation of inflation explained by the model appears to have been relatively small for the better part of the unpredictable much, the variables has declined.  Therefore, forecasts, one might view the glass as either half-full or half-empty.

the model's components for measures of literature has also considered a wide So what do we know about the usefulness of forecasting inflation?  As noted on page 11 of the handout, many studies have examined the efficacy of output gaps, unemployment gaps, and other economic activity for forecasting inflation.  The array of other indicators that might have predictive content for inflation, including asset prices, import prices, and measures of supply shocks to food or energy.

the crucial role of economic drivers in structural models of inflation, the evidence in the forecasting literature indicates that including these drivers than helps, forecast accuracy.  Although some indicators may literature has yet to provide a definitive explanation for why is that a Phillips curve relationship does weak enough to be difficult to consistently see in forecast comparisons Despite body of typically harms, rather help forecast inflation in particular periods, they don't consistently improve accuracy over long periods.  The this is the case.  One possibility among others exist but is over 10 to 30 years.

the model:  the timetypically use one of two approaches to the trend as a long-run expectation of Philadelphia's Survey of approach is consistent with a common as a long-horizon forecast.  The second approach Page 12 of the handout turns to another key component of varying long-run trend.  Forecasting studies measuring the trend.  The first simply defines from a survey such as the Federal Reserve Bank Professional Forecasters.  Conceptually, this econometric definition of trend

The trend previous value and an error term, indicators to the model, such as survey-based measures treats the trend as unobserved and estimates and trend inflation, taking the form given in equations (2) and (3) inflation equation (2) is the same equation (3), which relates the current trend to its serves to capture a smoothly varying trend in inflation.  Some studies have extended this approach by adding other of inflation expectations or bond yields.

improves historical forecast accuracy, I should acknowledge that the model economic questions surrounding trend inflation, inflation expectations, policy.  It is also possible that, if inflation remains broadly stable and as inflation from the mid-1960s through the early 1980s and the disinflation fade further into the past, the importance of modeling a timeless important than it has been historically. Although the literature has established that including a time-varying inflation trend can't address or monetary the upward trend in subsequent varying trend in inflation could become perspective on the recent behavior of inflation, its trend, and survey observed variables not only PCE inflation, but inflation expectations from both the Survey of Professional Forecasters equations for inflation (4) and (5)-take the same basic form as I model, inflation has trend and cycle case, though, I have dropped economic drivers-the for simplicity; in the research that developed the model, gap had little effect on trend inflation estimates To provide measures of long-run inflation expectations, I will now present results from a particular model that fits within the class I have described.  The model, detailed on page 13 of the handout, includes as also long-run and the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers.  The and for trend inflation-equations described a few minutes ago.  As before, in the components.  In this x variables-out of the model the inclusion of an unemployment and reduced historical forecast accuracy.

idea is that the survey expectations, along with itself, may provide useful information on trend inflation.  This model an empirical assessment of how closely inflation expectations reflect in actual inflation.  The survey expectations can move more or less from the trend by wedges that vary over and (7) that are model, and it lacks the economic structure that would be needed to causality. The model adds in equations (6) and (7) to relate the SPF and Michigan expectations to trend inflation.  The inflation structure permits long-run trends than one-for-one with trend inflation or differ time, captured by the intercept and slope coefficients of equations (6) allowed to vary smoothly over time.  But, again, to be clear about limitations, this is an econometric address questions of measures of inflation and inflation expectations show fit actual historical inflation as well as the precision of the trend inflation In the study of Chan, Clark, and Koop that developed the model, historical estimates obtained with various that long-run survey expectations provide information that improves both the model's ability to estimates.  But the survey expectations cannot simply be equated with trend inflation: although the surveys do move with the trend, persistent differentials exist.  Finally,

is as accurate as the best-performing benchmarks literature. for forecasting inflation, this model from the provides the current estimate of trend inflation obtained model, using quarterly data through 2017.  The chart displays the point the trend as the black line and the 68 percent confidence band with the line marks the FOMC's 2 percent objective.

Both the SPF and Michigan expectations measures exceed the estimated trend, Michigan more so than SPF.  As to recent 2008 to 2015, the estimated trend has been stable.  Looking ahead, medium-run forecasts from the model directly reflect the trend estimate.  For 2019 and 2020, the model's point forecast is 1.8 percent, with a 68 percent confidence interval of about 1.0 percent to 2.6 percent.

I will now turn to page based confidence bands like the ones I just forecast associated with parameter estimation and the model's error term, they don't reflect Many specific models are viable, and we don't know which one is 'true.'

As I described earlier, despite the crucial role such as output gaps in inflation models has had a improving forecasting accuracy, and many such indicators perform comparably.

Although some studies have advocated particular measures of is little to distinguish the time, models with very different trends can yield very different inflation.  For example, studies by Stock and Watson and by Faust and been successful in forecasting incorporates an econometric trend, whereas the the Stock-Watson model project PCE inflation of 1.6 percent in 2019 and The choice of a time-varying trend measure represents another important source of forecast uncertainty. trend, in broad comparisons over 20 to 30 years, there performance of different time-varying trend specifications.  Nonetheless, at any particular point in forecasts of Wright have developed models that have historically inflation.  The Stock-Watson model Faust-Wright model measures the trend with a survey-based expectation.  Updated estimates of 2020.  In contrast, a Faust-Wright forecast obtained using SPF expectations puts PCE inflation at 2 percent in 2019 and 2020.

It has come to this:  The earlier declines in inflation is on its way back to 2 percent. of a move upward from a low of 1.30 percent in August to in September, to 1.49 percent in November, and to 1.52 percent in look for five- or six-tenths of a away from target but instead move to just two- or three-tenths away. targeting that, earlier, we likely would have The most index-that's second decimal place matters, because we're looking for signs that inflation were indeed transitory, and that Evidence so far consists 1.35 percent December.

This is not a first-order miss. Now, as page 17 in your packet shows, core PCE inflation, the blue line, has remained stubbornly below 2 percent since 2012.  Of course, during a good part of that period, the unemployment elevated, which in bank's target.  As shown in the consistently overpredicted inflation during this period.  Some of this error likely reflects the fact that earlier assessments of the natural rate of unemployment were higher than current estimates-a topic to which I will return in a moment. likely reflects unexpected dollar appreciation.  It is important to note that both the SEP inflation forecast errors and period, which are not shown in the exhibit, have been quite a bit smaller average errors in of biblical of explanations have been forwarded to explain low inflation in the prices for cell phones, prescription drugs, and imported Taking that perspective onboard-that this puzzle is not one proportions-a number as itemized in exhibit 18 of your handout.

Like the expectations-augmented model, it as the gap which is explicit about underlying economic which captures key statistical regularities without taking as strong a stand on fundamental relationships.  This distinction is the subject of your next exhibit on page 20.

As the diagram suggests, the Committee's setting of the policy noting the influence of policy actions, realized inflation, and the inflation goal on long-run expectations.  Of course, the diagram is not a complete depiction of all the interactions.

As the exhibit also suggests, the slope of regression lines that run through the unemployment gap-appears to be shallower although it is not zero.

Thus, some expectations.  But, in this case, come from.

As suggested at the outset and summarized on page 26, it is to put recent inflation puzzles in historical context.  This is not an event the size the Great Depression, the great inflation, the great disinflation, or the Great just not that 'great.'  Inflation has fallen short of our target by a we would have thought quite difficult to attain earlier, and which in fact to attain in the future.

All that the forecast errors aren't particularly large during the most a decade, we've more or less missed little bit more about those two observations and And could you maybe talk a little bit about there are any biases in the errors that would indicate that there's some kind of in the error structure that would be consistent with that? MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you very much for quite useful three presentations highlighted recent period, and yet we've been in a period in which, for our 2 percent inflation target.  Could you talk a how you would weigh those two observations? whether fundamental process that we're missing?  You illustrated a number of possibilities, but is there anything

From a forecasting perspective, regarding bias, it and the horizon.  So, as Jeff noted, the SEP at a 2-year horizon a 1-year horizon.  Some of the consistent bias over the past 10 or so Faust and Wright forecast is an example of one, because it quickly MR. CLARK.  Excellent questions. does depend in part on the model has tended to underpredict inflation and not so much at econometric models I described have not had a substantial, years.  Others have.  The moves to 2 percent, and we've been below 2 percent.  It is biased.

a broader historical perspective, it's not clear this is in the broader context of our challenges in forecasting It doesn't mean that it's not different, but that it's, I think, too soon to say.  It's one of cases of 'We'll continue monitoring, we'll see.'  You know, the decline in predictive that exist in the literature yet.  One has gotten better at stabilizing inflation, and we first saw that in the Moderation.  As it applied to economic volatility, it applies to inflation if not a large degree.  So it's possible that we're a victim of In connection with Jeff's point, in really something fundamentally different inflation. those content of our models-there aren't great explanations possibility is that policy debate on the Great volatility to some degree, at least,

You know, I had a feeling you were going to ask that question, Eric. a different take on that question, some past 10 or 12 years, inflation has been persistently below our MR. FUHRER.

I think, from the perspective of the model that I draw in the the one that inflation But during that time would expect that, other things being equal, to pull inflation below the central long-run expectations.  In addition, there were significant and somewhat import prices that, in many years during that period, did probably pull the inflation rate down.  I think that if particularly biased.  And, again, and related to Todd's point, not to say that we know that nothing has changed-we never explain a good portion of would just echo the point that in the decomposition on slide 8 of past five or six years are actually positive, which means MS.

I don't think that there is a persistent bias.  But, from 2011 to inflation was actually higher than what this model can explain, knowing the actual fundamentals. So, if anything, the model is excluding 2017, which came period, 2016, they are pretty much positive.

So really important. MR. FUHRER.  I would say, on that point, that the thing Woodford model does As you note, the expectations that it those forward, what that implies those expectations are what matter most, and those are central.  So when Mike Woodford-I will speak for implicitly, in that model, is talking about managing expectations, about the way in which monetary policy can affect the that's

We made fun of their monetary policy-glibly, I have sympathy for the difficulties faced trying to move inflation as high as they would have liked it to have been. It seems, econometrically, that you can find some link between those expectations and the realizations of inflation-that seems to be the case-but parallels between the experience in Japan think-a couple of decades ago.  Today I would just say, we they have are still rough parallel there, but I think they faced challenges that are an order of things to try to make that work. Our problems, in comparison, are probably an order of magnitude smaller.  There problems, and there's a magnitude larger.  And, in that respect, I have great sympathy for them, because they've been trying a lot of

It's less susceptible to monetary policy actions in that, yes, for any given change in the federal funds rate that delivers a given change in, see already a somewhat smaller response of inflation-not zero, is, depending on your estimate of the size of the unemployment time, a larger gap multiplied by even a small coefficient the nonlinearity as we get into a lower unemployment rates, it could have noticeable effects on inflation.

Further questions? opportunity now to comment on inflation, and a Let's begin appreciate the opportunity to for this MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I comment on the staff's inflation framework as outlined in the background memos meeting.  I know these memos are time-consuming projects, and I thought they provided a good starting point for the Committee discussion today.

contemporary discussions, the term 'Phillips curve effects' is taken to the idea that the level of real resource utilization is a primary determinant of at a business cycle frequency.  My main comment is that Phillips curve effects of this In most encapsulate inflation type are overemphasized in the deliberations of this Committee as well as in financial market commentary.

sometimes explicitly stated, that faster real GDP mechanically lead to inflation in the U.S. economy.  I interpret the staff as wishing to have a clean empirical measures of real regression context. It is often implicitly assumed, and growth, lower unemployment, robust job growth, or similar factors will more model of this process.  They want to relate business-cycle-frequency inflation to resource utilization in a

A variant of this result is that the constant term is not actually is, instead, slowly drifting over time.  In any case, measures of real resource 'The Case This is not just a U.S. phenomenon.

Meltzer and the Search for a Nominal Anchor,' coefficient in question was clearly negative since the Disappearing Phillips Curve is an international mystery.  Why has this A likely reason not extensively discussed in the memos, but mentioned just now by is the success of inflation targeting over the past 25 years.  Inflation targeting came as precepts, either implicitly or United States.  In addition, inflation targeting has been with the monetary policy experience in the 1970s and early 1980s. The Case of occurred? Todd Clark, on the international central banking scene in the 1990s and gained wider and wider acceptance time went on.  Many countries adopted inflation-targeting explicitly, including, in my opinion, the quite successful compared

This success did because of better understanding of empirical Phillips curve relationships.  It came about because of a better understanding of the overwhelming importance of expectations-and especially expectations of future monetary policy-in the determination of today's inflation outcomes.

inflation targeting is also the lead suspect in The Case of the Disappearing inflation targeting, they have to keep inflation closer and closer to their targets.  The theoretical limit of this process is exactly at target all the time and never moves.  In that case, attempts likely to show no relationship at all. correctly say that inflation is best described as a constant.  That to be what is happening today in the empirical inflation literature.

During this period, market-based inflation expectations were saying, in effect, that our were saying that we should have normalized years ago.

Markets policy was appropriate during this period-whereas Phillips curve- and Taylor rule-type approaches

So this theory is who are interested, you might see the paper by rate pegs titled 'Do Higher Interest Rates Raise or Lower that we work with.

The fundamental insight of the Phillips curve, that a robust economy tends to push inflation up, provides link connecting our policy actions to the attainment of our what is described in any of that we use, and a multitude of observed and unobserved factors influence economic like inflation, and these cloud underlying macroeconomic relationships, like the In the parlance of economics textbooks, these represent shifts in the Phillips than movements along the curve.

First, the examination of past episodes that were largely demandthose times when monetary policy created positive or negative, there was a significant response of Despite these challenges in estimating the Phillips curve using time-series data, there are two empirical strategies standard model driven can be informative.  Such episodes filter out some of the extraneous noise-these shifts in the curve, if you will.  For example, if you look at sustained unemployment gaps, either inflation in accord with the standard Phillips curve.

the Federal Reserve System have examined the variation in and found support for a Phillips curve relationship between and economic activity as represented in the Phillips curve. A second source of supporting evidence comes from studying more granular data.  That approach can also reduce the influence of confounding factors.  For example, a number of researchers from around unemployment and inflation across states or metro areas relationship.  So, again, summing up, I maintain that there's still a strong inflation itself, and I'm better forecasting models is valuable, and, of course, we want to have the best litany of variables, including the exchange rate, the stock market, bond that it will stay at or near its current value. I do want to add some concluding comments about forecasting as an end in going to pick up on something that Jeff said in his presentation in talking about this.  We know that getting forecasting models that we can.  But the reality is, a well-known regularity in economic forecasting is that, for a yields, and inflation, actually, the best forecast is

thinking about this from a business person's perspective, my only question is, I can make my pricing and other decisions, I knowing that.  Just give me the best forecast that you can, and I really relationships may or may not be embedded in that.  And, again, that treats inflation as an exogenous process like a research, along with the work of Stock and Watson and others.  But I think it's important that that we are not passive observers of the economy.  Our actions shape the economic the future path of the economy and inflation.  In and how those, in turn, affect employment and inflation, our dual-mandate goals. But if I'm 'What's inflation likely to be next year?'

So I think we have to recognize that them and then stay humble, do some model averaging, and continue to foster more research on inflation dynamics.

a basic Phillips curve model that relates inflation to past inflation, inflation real activity is at the foundation of the New Keynesian structural workhorse model for monetary policy.  So I view it as a useful way I think expectations, and some measure of model, which is a

First, how households and firms form their expectations that wage and price setting is an area that been done to date.

And their subsequent analysis confirms those earlier work indicates that the traditional Phillips curve is likely to be known that the statistical measures of gaps that underpin it are those to output gaps.  That point is made in numerous papers in the literature.  Also, labor that reflect tightness in employment-to-employment transitions may be better Existing theoretical unstable.  Additionally, it is well poor proxies for the theoretical gaps that are present in New Keynesian settings, especially that refer market conditions aligned with wage and price pressures than is the unemployment gap itself.

While recent more serious, the larger question for me is the persistence of lower-than-target always have an explicit target, it was arguably implicit and Perhaps of greater significance than the absence of any slope in the Phillips curve is the systematic shortfall in inflation, as others have noted.  Over the exceeded shortfalls are a bit inflation rates.  Although we didn't no lower than 2 percent.

the current difficulty with interpreting slack, I have been increasingly drawn to the interpretation, or usage, of the models.  While I realize this merely involves some is easier than trying to below the natural rate, that interest Due to Wicksellian algebraic dexterity, I find that thinking about a low natural interest rate think about the current value of slack.  Basically, if you push interest rates you should see inflation rising.  A lack of any acceleration in inflation then implies rates are not below the natural rate, or at least not too far below the natural rate.

to turn to the strong challenge that Jeff Fuhrer makes to the unsophisticated use of long-term expectations measures in our inflation models.  I particularly enjoyed this memo.  It very serious look at the New Keynesian model. Now, to address the question of why I think inflation has been low in recent quarters, I'd like inflation takes a investigation of the New Keynesian Phillips curve.  In particular, determine inflation.  There is no independent role for long-run inflation result depends crucially on the public firmly central bank will ultimately steer inflation to its target and that this target is that the public believes we will deliver 2 percent inflation on have noted here before, some of our communications and actions could suggest we rates when inflation is well be below our symmetric 2 percent target.  And when the zero-lowermay have doubts as to our ability to achieve it. Jeff provides a careful in that model, the current resource gap, cost shocks, and short-run inflation expectations are sufficient to expectations.  However, as Jeff mentions, this believing that the known to the public.  This is not an innocuous assumption.  In our current environment, I don't think we can take it for granted average.  As I view 2 percent as a ceiling on inflation.  For example, we have raised below target and is showing few signs of moving up.  So the public's long-run inflation expectations could well bound risk is also considered, the public

to be an important I didn't read Jeff's memo as suggesting otherwise, but I see the more broadly.  I think that's why surveys and market measures of long-run expectations can useful in forecasting.  They also inform us about the degree of misperception that policy we don't do it, inflation won't settle out at target once cyclical dynamics The point is, the public's long-run inflation expectations have determinant of actual inflation. role be needs to correct.  And if have run their course.

January 30-31, 2018

the ECB in 2014 and 2015, explicitly cited indications of an strong credible long-run expectations in the inflation process.  And so to part, the low inflation in recent quarters reflects slippage in And I note that other central banks, like deterioration in these long-run inflation expectations, and I think that these are important role beyond resource gaps, at least in their policy calculation.  And I see the public and market responses when central bankers do whatever-it-takes actions as important evidence for a separate role for answer the question, I think, in some these long-run expectations below our inflation objective.  That's debatable, of course.

and perhaps underappreciated, I Jeff reproduces the well-known flat estimates for the slope of the Phillips curve that the flatter slope than in the 1970s and '80s may reflect the the FOMC is going to be doing a better job of maintaining also an important model parameters changing over time in the context of this today is that we must keep in mind the influence that lower I have a couple other comments to make on Jeff's exploration of the non-accelerationist Phillips curve.  The non-accelerationist feature is important think.  First, using data since 2000.  He notes public's understanding and faith that price stability than it did back then.  This is a very plausible explanation.  It is example of reduced-form specification.  And the lesson for r * , greater zero-lower-bound risks, and policy misperceptions may be exerting on our models' parameters.

Ironically, this section in the memo actually reduced my My second comment concerns Jeff's segmented non-accelerationist Phillips curve.  Using data since 1990, he finds baseline linear model.  Let's fear of outsized inflation.  I have to explain that.

say that if long-run expectations stay anchored near cites this often-to reduce the role of long-run inflation expectations If I understand correctly, his results our target-and Jeff

January 30-31, 2018

could drop pretty low without inflation getting all that high. Under a natural rate of 4½ percent, an unemployment gap of minus 1 percent, which would put us on the steep portion of curve.  Still, running the numbers through his model, inflation would go up to only isn't 4 percent.  Indeed, is steep on the way up, it's steep on the way down, too.  So as soon as unemployment this exercise, inflation would come back down quickly. independently, then unemployment For instance, suppose unemployment dropped to 3½ percent. it would be the Phillips about 2.5 percent the way we calculated it.  That's noticeable, but it sure it's the same size miss we've suffered to the downside, on average, over the past 10 years.  And if the slope rises back to the natural rate in marginal cost effect on inflation summarized by the Phillips times the unemployment rate gap.  You solve it forward so that inflation today the known constant long-run target plus the discounted sum of current and future gap what Jeff has in his memo.  For beta, it equaled 0.95-this is an annual calculation. largest Phillips curve coefficient, a 1 percentage point unemployment rate gap for five that, would get inflation up to 3.7 percent.  That's a big years-three years at 3½ percent, that's a long just illustrative.  And also, I haven't taken into might come about once you do that transition, which would Now, you can also do this kind of back-of-the-envelope analysis in a simple forwardlooking Keynesian model, with the curve coefficient equals effects, like And Jeff's years, then reverting to zero after number.  If the unemployment gap lasted three time-inflation would rise to 3.1 percent.  Now, these quick reversions may be unrealistic dynamics-3½, then up to 4½-but this is account any recession dynamics that lower your inflation expectations.

I am less certain today about the price-setting process in that I think dramatically causing industry restructurings. On the second question about inflation expectations in wages and prices, I actually think, for me, now, that's two separate questions, and we struggle a Bank of inflation today, as I've said before, companies are much more preoccupied, in setting prices, on industry dynamics and their lack of pricing power because of technology enabling consumers, which has shifted the balance of power from businesses to consumers; new models for selling and distributing goods and services; and, lastly, technology capability not previously foreseen and widely distributed, which is having an effect of two, they are striving for scale-mergers, consolidationsthey'll have more pricing power, but simply because they recognize they to maintain margins, they need more scale.

whole discussion, I've been reflecting on various decisions I've made or in as an executive of various companies, as a board member of various private or firms.  Our pricing decisions were driven by a number of things:  assessment of the our quality relative to alternatives, of an indictment of my perspicacity than an indication of the absence of role of setting, economic decisionmaking, in determining actual inflation. During this participated public competition, our cost structure, our perception of technological developments.  But our inflation expectations never entered into it.

that the staff have so well prepared us for is an important and timely one.  I and the presentation that you gave us have been extremely minute.  The question I occasionally get stuck on is why we, as policymakers, are so attached to the classic price The topic think the materials you put together helpful.  I wanted to start by flipping the questions on their head for just a that Phillips curve when its empirical performance is so weak.

answer may be that the convenience of the Phillips curve is even stronger mandate to a tightly linked The simple than its empirical performance has been weak.  If the Phillips curve actually worked in practice as it does in theory, it would essentially allow us to collapse our dual target.  We could steer by the unemployment gap, confident that inflation would move in the predicted direction with a lag.

one key instrument, it would greatly simplify our task to have a single a lag-conveniently enabling us to accomplish both path in the same direction.  It would also allow us to place reliance on unemployment data, which conveniently are released at high frequency and are than many of our other Because we have comprehensive target.  We could then be confident that, as unemployment moves below its natural rate, inflation would rise with objectives by adjusting the policy rate great seen as highly reliable and subject to relatively more modest revisions aggregate data series.

theory and economy policy, things that seem too simple to be true One lesson I've drawn over many years as a policymaker is that, as often as not, at the interface between economic often are.  And that's why we're having this discussion today-because inflation dynamics are complex, and policy needs to grapple with that complexity.

the staff memos as well as lessons learned from a variety of episodes, both here at My own views on the inflation process are heavily informed by the empirical work surveyed in

First, put simply, the Phillips inform my assessment of appropriate is a bit lower than that in the staff analysis. Second, underlying trend inflation appears to exert a very important gravitational force. A range of estimates suggests it has drifted down since the financial crisis, and it is currently running below 2 percent.  My personal estimate

clear that temporary factors were a contributing factor in holding down low and the Phillips curve to be very will be as close to our objective by the end of the year as it is the dollar associated with Third, while it's inflation last year, because I view the underlying trend to be flat, I'm not confident that inflation in the Tealbook baseline.  Against this, of course, the depreciation of stronger-than-expected growth abroad should work to bolster inflation in the near term.

Insofar as inflation to which policy might be able to influence that underlying trend.  There is actually not a lot of work on how monetary policy adjustments can inflation.

is headed in wedge between those longer-run inflation somewhat useful to think about that.  In in research papers. Although, in the simplest versions of the canonical framework, there is always a perfect alignment between our inflation target and the public's perception of where inflation the long run, this framework can accommodate a expectations and our inflation target.  And I think it's particular, if the public's perception of our target is determined by our actions and the public's resulting experience of inflation, there may not be perfect alignment.  The implications of such a framework have been worked out

January 30-31, 2018

framework, in order to raise longer-run inflation expectations, monetary policy might expect, given the current perception of the target.  The resulting surprise would lead to an upward revision in the public's of our target.  Of course, such a policy would also lead to lower unemployment, and course could, in turn, help boost actual inflation.  But, in this framework, that channel is a sideshow.  What is key is the effect of monetary policy on underlying inflation. In this would need to run a bit looser than the public credibility of the assessment this of mostly current situation through this kind of lens, it appears the Committee, as to run policy looser than policy prescriptions, and that, in turn, may tend to boost the So, looking at the represented by the median SEP response, has shown some willingness would be predicted by conventional public's perception of our inflation objective back toward our 2 percent target.

The past few important role for trend decline in the long-run neutral interest rate to historically low extended experience of low inflation during a time when policy as constrained in its ability to respond may be a factor in the downward movement of inflation trend. In looking beyond the medium-term path inflation dynamics also years have been characterized not only by a flat Phillips curve and an underlying inflation, but also by a levels.  In this environment, the was seen the anticipated to be low for some time, the low average increases the likelihood of hitting the effective lower bound on nominal rates, which, under conventional policy prescriptions, could impart a downward bias to As we look ahead, with long-run r * level of interest rates interest inflation.

approaches So how might a longer-term strategy address this challenge?  A variety of have been suggested.  One is a substantial increase in the inflation target to, say, 4 percent.  The

January 30-31, 2018

straightforward.  If real interest rates remain low in the longer run, to ensure that recessions, on the order of 400 basis points or more.  I don't tend to favor this kind to explain to the public.  It could risk unmooring from values whose achievement was hard won.  And it would be a very this approach is going to be necessary. main argument is pretty maybe between 0 and 50 basis points, 4 percent inflation would provide the room nominal interest rates would be high enough at their peak to support the kind of cuts we have seen in past of an approach.  I think it could be very difficult inflation expectations difficult decision to reverse.  I am also not sure alternative group of policies would, instead, strive to make up for past inflation approaches, the FOMC would retain our 2 percent target and would that any shortfall from the target that occurred, for example, An misses.  In this class of operate policy in such a manner during an effective lower bound episode would be made up in a future period.

And one important variant is targeting approach advocated, or at This approach would aim to hit the would make up any target shortfalls temporary overshoot, in effect delaying the departure from

One key benefit of this kind of relatively easy policy persistent misses that occurred The promise of easier thus, eases overall financial conditions during the

And by effective lower bound has been reached, such anchor inflation expectations, because there would be confidence that lower bound episode would be made up for. From this perspective, a preannounced plan for asymmetry allowing somewhat higher inflation after the policies may help better any shortfall during the effective meeting, I would be interested in hearing the pros and cons of various as a forerunner to a Committee discussion of how we may want to statement on longer-run goals.

I found them a helpful reminder of what we know and what we don't know about the determinants of inflation to the perspective that, in the short to medium run, expectations, anchored by a policy that is committed to price stability. As I think about our mandate for price stability, distinguishing between the short medium run and the long run is key.  I start from inflation depends on a wide variety of factors, only one of which is economic slack.  Over the longer run, I view inflation as being determined largely by market monetary

economic slack, either in the labor market or product on inflation.  More important has been something that Jon Leeper referred to in their 2015 Jackson Hole paper as 'disparate confounding These disparate factors would include highly transitory changes in relative prices, Recent evidence suggests that markets, has been a weak influence Faust and Eric dynamics.'

in telecom prices, as well as structural and persistent changes as what we saw the past several years with healthcare prices. such as the steep decline last year in price dynamics, such confounding dynamics, it is probably unrealistic to expect that the short to medium run.  In fact, our Statement Monetary Policy Strategy recognizes this by referring to our inflation of that longer-run objective, it seems quite range around that inevitable in the short to medium run. In the presence of these monetary policy can tightly control inflation in of Longer-Run Goals and objective as a 'longer-run goal.'  In support reasonable to view small and even possibly persistent deviations within a objective, both higher and lower, as

As I will discuss tomorrow, I job market and because inflation slipped somewhat. MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  In answer to the questions the staff posed, yes, I do subscribe utilization believe inflation is low because there may still be slack in the expectations and trend inflation have call the underlying Phillips curve.  Starting with at managing the measured Phillips curve has flattened.  This is obvious.  If we are perfect at inflation, the measured Phillips curve will appear perfectly flat. I believe the Phillips curve is flat because of central bank actions.  I distinguish between what I call a measured Phillips curve and what I the measured Phillips curve, as advanced-economy central banks have gotten better inflation, controlling

advanced-economy central banks have gained Phillips curve will be. With regard to the underlying Phillips curve, here, too, I think central banks have influence through the expectations channel.  As credibility and as inflation expectations have become solidly anchored, I believe the behavior of firms and workers has adjusted, and they are now less responsive to changes in output.  The more credibility we have and the more solidly anchored expectations are, the flatter the underlying talk about inflation driving their price setting.  That, to me, front and center.  But they are, in a sense, taking the monetary And just to respond a little bit to Governor Quarles's and President Kaplan's comments, when I talk to businesses, they never is an expression of anchored inflation expectations.  If inflation expectations were higher or unanchored, it would be

I think We have seen the flattening of Phillips curves all at the this is a direct result of advanced economies pursuing similar monetary policy strategies and gaining independence and credibility with the public.

Second, is central bank actions that are largely responsible for flattening the Phillips to lose our conviction to achieve our dual-mandate goals or lose maintaining political independence or lose our credibility with the public. So, finally, what do I think would cause a Phillips curve to steepen?  Well, one option is, we use up start walking up the nonlinear curve, which I think we will see and we will respond if I'm right that it curve, then it would require us our conviction in those because, frankly, I have great confidence in everybody maintaining those.  And so I'm not worried that curve, because I think that's within I think, as I'm going to talk about tomorrow, continuing on our current policy rate curve and continue to anchor expectations below our to this tomorrow. I'm not worried about around the table, that we are all committed to one day we're going to wake up and find a steeper Phillips our control. path will likely further flatten the Phillips 2 percent target.

The last thing I will comment on risk of a nonlinearity.  You cannot completely dismiss following Japan's path.  That's also possible.  And so as, we weigh these we shouldn't just weigh the low-probability event by the nonlinear Phillips curve.  We should also look at

Excellent presentations.  Very well done.  My views on the inflation process are pretty believe the degree of labor market relationship between wages and prices is considerably looser.  Keep the unemployment rate well below Sustain that inflation.

Goods prices are determined mostly on a global basis, and Services prices and contracts are more generally determined locally and typically have a these prices more sensitive to increases in nominal wages. I also believe that prices for there are many factors, such as currency movements, that weaken the linkage between wages and prices. higher labor component, which makes more visible yet.  First, we've only recently gotten to the vicinity of full employment. there is one, is not why inflation was low before 2017, only why we haven't In the current environment, I don't think we should be very surprised that inflation hasn't become So the mystery, if seen an uptick in inflation lately.

Many prices tend to be sticky, so it takes time for higher wages to be reflected in higher inflation might also take some time because the between wages and prices is so weak, so it's hard to discern signal from noise in the relationship between wages and prices is so weak. expectations are so well anchored, Fifth, observing an increase in relationship data.  There are several reasons for why that And, as others have said, the main one is the fact that inflation presumably at or below our 2 percent objective.

inflation hasn't moved up yet.  It flat, but that doesn't mean it's completely flat or nonexistent.  The fact that we do see wage growth in states with lower unemployment rates does help confirm, at least that the Phillips curve framework still works. So, to put it all together, we shouldn't be surprised that doesn't necessarily mean that our inflation framework is broken.  The Phillips curve may be quite higher nominal to me, the and inflation, then what is the inflation process?  If inflation just depends on expectations alone, then what drives inflation expectations?  I think for those who are articulate what they its stead.  If there were no relationship between labor market utilization and wages and should actually be doing more to push the unemployment rate even lower.  But Finally, if you don't believe there's a relationship between the degree of tightness and U.S. labor markets inflation critical of the Phillips curve framework, I think they have an obligation to prefer in prices, then we

historical experience-and this is something that John Williams alluded to-would tell us that's a very bad idea.  Eventually, inflation would head up, we'd have to respond by tightening monetary policy aggressively, and we would precipitate the next recession.  That would not be consistent with our dual-mandate objectives.

This situation continued until the run-up in asset prices Accordingly, in early 2017 we increased our assessment back to 'notable.'  In mid2017 we increased a broad-based increased appetite or for risk among investors.  Such appetite must be part of the explanation for Bitcoin, shown in panel 2.

However, should valuation pressures could build up.  That's examined on the next exhibit. The valuation measures in panels 3 and 4 are spreads over 10-year Treasury yields.

If one decided that in the output gap of 0.9 percent, what would it imply for the roughly?  Is it 50 basis points, 100 basis points?  I know you have to how those interest rate hikes play into the dollar and the stock do we have any sense of the order of magnitude, how hard it would be to push back That's my first question.  You canVICE CHAIRMAN you're going to get So the output gap has one wanted to not have that increase interest rate trajectory, make a lot of assumptions about market, but against that?

Reifschneider, have you done the FRB/US model simulation in MR. WILCOX.  Dave your head yet?  [Laughter]

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I mean, you can come back later.  I'd just be curious how much would-

WILCOX. So the 0.9 percentage point is at the end of 2020.  So let's call it three MR. years from now.

Now, whether it MR. WILCOX.  I think Dave raises I hope FRB/US coordinator would work out precisely the same, I think it'd be very hard to know.

DUDLEY.  Thank you.  That's a great response. VICE CHAIRMAN

One place in which you can see a similar result is the Monetary Policy section of Tealbook A, when you look at the Tealbook-consistent measure a bit over 1 percentage point since the December Tealbook.  So I think it MR. LAUBACH. Strategies r *.  .That has been revised up just is consistent with that ballpark.

DUDLEY.  Okay.  Thank you.  My second question was on the lowest since 2005.  I don't is a growth question or a financial stability question, but how much risk do we think VICE CHAIRMAN household savings rate.  So the household savings rate declined to the know if this that holds?

MR. WILCOX.  Risks to households?

January 30-31, 2018

DUDLEY.  Well, I mean, it is a financial-you could argue it's sort financial.  The household sector is assuming trajectory, presumably to household savings rate.  So, how should we think about it?  I guess that's my VICE CHAIRMAN of on the real side, but you could also argue it's some sort of a sustainment of the housing prices and equity market support that question.

And we Price Appreciation but Saving' quadrant for a long time, which, in his is the top left, which is 'Asset Price Appreciation highlighted in my remarks, at this point we don't leverage built up in the system, but that's obviously the risk that we're focusing on.

So I'm remembering, somewhat imperfectly, a very nice four-quadrant diagram produced by David's colleague, Jae Sim, which is based on the integrated macroeconomic accounts and relates have been in an 'Asset taxonomy, is the top right.  The dangerous one and Dissaving or Borrowing.'  So I think, as I see a lot of

DUDLEY.  It's a net number, though.  So presuming you're not also not seeing much saving either, right?  I mean, to get that got toVICE CHAIRMAN seeing much borrowing, but you're net number, it's right, and of course, it doesn't include businesses and in this sector. MR. LEHNERT.  No, you're quite so forth.  But the household sector has its portions that have high debt-to-income ratios still, and that are otherwise under stress, but, very broadly speaking, debt has been growing less quickly than income for a long, long time

DUDLEY.  I've taken some comfort from that, because what I worry it now manifest in the VICE CHAIRMAN about is, we think that asset valuations are elevated.  We're also seeing household savings rate.  What happens if asset valuations come down?  Does that create a

It looks here like the ratio of about 6.8 multiples, and that's higher than in any other period on this chart, which historically has been negatively associated with the saving rate.

They're subject to very large revisions. keep an eye household budget constraints.  It's taken us a long time to get to that conclusion, but that's what our experience with real-time data suggests.

DUDLEY.  I was also thinking it might be understated just for the Andreas said.  I mean, we do observe the debt numbers.  They are probably pretty that pretty well.  So maybe that should make us VICE CHAIRMAN reasons that accurate in terms of debt.  We probably measure feel a little bit more comfortable.  Thank you.

side, Jeff Fuhrer talked about the risk if we have nonlinearities in the Phillips curve. MR. ROSENGREN.  This is a question for both David and Andreas.  As David highlighted, with the Tealbook baseline, we get down to 3.2 percent unemployment.  On the inflation

January 30-31, 2018

the financial stability risk?  I assume when we do our financial with the macro conditions as they are now, but the Tealbook financial stability risk that that poses in the longer run, or do you see that as a Could you talk a little bit about stability framework, we're doing it highlights macroeconomic conditions that we haven't seen since the '50s.  So how do you think about the significant risk?

don't comment on the likelihood of various events occurring, having learned that the pre-crisis experience.  But we do think about inflationary scenarios. There have stress tests Committee's target and short rates rose itself in our models or in our framework is potential for a large drop in asset prices, although that is cushioned somewhat.  If then real prices of things like houses and buildings can go is obviously pegged to the nominal value of it.  So that's sort of by less. MR. LEHNERT.  Well, by 'significant risk,' I hope you don't mean 'likelihood,' because we lesson from been repeated-not to always bring up the stress tests-but there have been repeated over the years in which inflation went above the significantly.  So the way this tends to manifest through the you think inflation is increasing, down, and the debt contract falling themselves short are going to be grappling with a higher funds because, presumably, the Committee will be tightening policy.  At the same time, risk premiums, and term premiums on Treasury bonds to return, for longer-term interest rates could be rising Financial institutions that fund cost of the potential for the whatever reason, to levels seen in the 1990s means that sharply.

David, can we talk about the staff's updated labor meeting, there's a pretty big change, as LFP is projected to be flat over instead of falling along the trend line.  I, for one, find that compelling.  I look at the labor market over the past couple of years, and this makes sense to me.  I But the trend has not been adjusted.  So my impression, looking at this graph, is that the increasing wedge between the forecast and the gap.  Could you just talk me through that? wage-growth environment.  Why does that feel unsustainable?  That feels sustainable to me.  So I don't see

MR. WASCHER.  Maybe I'll take the first stab at it.

MR. KASHKARI.  Sure.

that our trend is a little bit flatter than it was before.  That's mainly due to our that the tax cuts will generate little bit to the participation rate. MR. WASCHER.  And David can add what he wants to add.  I guess the first thing to note is assumptions about the effects of the tax act on trend labor supply: a little bit more labor supply over time, and that adds a the other reason that it's flatter-so, basically, right now the downtrend is all due is-it's really the aging of the I think to demographics.

other reason that the actual LFP is flatter than before and looks to the downtrendMR. WASCHER.  The flat now relative you mean the forecast?  I'm sorry.  I just want to make sure I MR. KASHKARI.  Do know-

is that as the labor market we've assumed that that's going to pull more people into the labor above its trend as the labor market tightens further and the output gap is positive-and the unemployment rate is much more below the natural rate.  And a little bit more of that effect into this forecast on tight labor market in the past looks like it's been associated with a rate a little further above trend, and we've got some other factors  as MR.

same lines as President Rosengren in terms of thinking about the relationship between thinking about these overvaluations or commercial estate, what kind of adjustments do you think we would need to see in order to expect there the macroeconomy?  Is it a 10 percent drop in commercial real estate it a 20 percent drop in valuation?  And just as some backdrop for this, you know, I the heat map a lot.  I like the concept and the conception.  I'm trying to figure out, in the triggers for concern are.  What are the signals that should tell me, given that we need to be worried about, or I need to be worried about?  So help MR. BOSTIC.  Yes, I had some questions for Andreas.  I was actually going to start along the the macroeconomic shocks and then sectors of the economy.  He went macro to the economy, so I was going to go the economy to macro.  In real to be a feedback into prices?  Is like context of that, what my this-is this a situation with that would be useful.

stability and with macro performance.  Our the financial stability framework is on larger-than-expected or larger-than-normal shocks.  So if the price of some key asset falls a lot, there would be the normal MR. LEHNERT.  Okay.  I think it depends on whether you're wearing your-as a policymaker, you are concerned both with financial focus in responses to wealth effects and financial accelerator effects, right?  The fact is that households and businesses cannot borrow as freely as they would like under any circumstances because of limited commitment, moral hazard, or whatever.

January 30-31, 2018

asset prices are always going to sorts of problems housing, response is far out of line with things like the normal macroeconomic very vulnerable, to a system that was highly leveraged, and to some inherent fragilities in the funding looking That's fundamentally in the economy, so drops in generate some additional effects through that channel.  But the multiplicative emerge when you get a situation, as in 2006, in which the price of an asset, residential falls 20 percent, and the dynamics.  And that was due to a household and business sector that was financial structure of the financial system at the time.  That's sort of the genesis of what we are for.

true that-research by economists here at the Board suggests that in times of left tail of asset prices has larger declines, like the 10th percentile-the looks worse in times of elevated valuations than in times of moderate situation like this is one asset prices could fall a great deal.  However, the response to amplified by the features financial systems had 10 years ago and that were a problem. It is elevated valuations, the 1-in-10 bad outcome valuations.  So, straying a little bit into statements about likelihood.  A in which it's not inconceivable that that price drop would not be one that we think would be accelerated or that four measures you have here. troublesome range.  I see that as like a a financial position of the private sector.  And what we've seen over the past couple is that things have happened.  Those two alone haven't triggered concerns about Does that imply, then, that we've got to get all four of these into some kind of to see a problem?  I'm curious to hear your thoughts MR. BOSTIC.  And then a second question, looking at the Two of them are green, and two of them are in the more credit cycle, of years systemic risk. yellow or red zone before we should expect on that.

[Laughter]  I mean, I notice theyou're describing is something that we've to and that would our assessment relate to a situation in which borrowing really began to a backdrop of loosening credit standards. MR. LEHNERT.  When I prepare a a rule that they obviously, what-the sort of configuration that thought about a lot.  I'd say, you know, the things that we are attentive probably lead us to raise accelerate against in commercial real estate, prices of certain apartment buildings are almost 40 percent above their at 10 years ago.  And the same time, we are seeing the average loan-to-value ratio on loans made against these We have reports that underwriters are tightening standards.  CMBS deals are protections.  So the CRE story is not one in which there is this toxic that is only possible because credit is expanding at the same Right now we have a situation in which, for example, are extremely high.  The prices pre-crisis peaks.  So they've gone and exceeded the levels that they were yet, at properties falling. adding additional sort of cycle of ever-loosening standards time.

one last question, and then we can move on.  The financial-sector MR. BOSTIC.  And leverage and the liquidity transformation are both green?

MR. LEHNERT.  Yes.

do you think the regulatory structure has played to MR. BOSTIC.  How much of a role put us in that position?

are these not really cyclical but, rather, really fair interpretation of your question?  I would say largest financial institutions plus-sort of combined with the analysis MR. LEHNERT.  Right.  So to what extent slow-moving quasi-structural factors?  Is that a that it's obviously played a really important role.  The post-crisis increase in resilience requirements among the

It's maturity and liquidity transformation space, for a long time we flagged the run risk embedded in money market mutual funds.  But once that had been fixed, we it seems like-there just isn't a lot In the potential took our assessment down.  It seems like a very-right now, of the kind of deal transformation or curve transformation that was so popular in the pre-crisis environment.

It's more just, let's see what we can tease out of long-term movements across a range of countries as an alternative to focusing on one economy and looking at evidence the Phillips curve that our previous presenters showed that relate inflation to past inflation or to a gap measure; something like that.  If you wanted to interpret too much of a role for monetary policy per se in inflation expectations.'  So if different the same monetary policy.  We're looking at the shocks to unemployment, output, and so on, and looking at their effect on inflation.  So to interpret the inflation model, you could abstract from the that different countries have different monetary policies or not. That said, let's just say that if you were wedded, literally, to some of inflation models inflation expectations, and those literally, you could say, 'Well, there's not that equation, except insofar as it might affect the gap measure and you took that approach, then you might say it really doesn't matter too much whether countries have different monetary policies or effect of depending on how literally you want fact

there is wide debate about most appropriate to address risks to financial little capacity to offset a significant financial instability in order to use such tools during bad times.  In policy buffer, using some combination of monetary, fiscal, economy and the financial system against diverse MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  While whether macro policy or regulatory tools are stability, at this point we have very shock.  One needs to build capacity in good times some ways, this is like building up a and regulatory policies, which can cushion the shocks, should they occur.

these policies should be interrelated, having inadequate cushions provided by each is certainly not where we want to be in the next On the fiscal policy side, the recent tax cuts and the likely resultant increase in the an adverse shock occurs, we now expansionary fiscal policy. While of our monetary, fiscal, and regulatory policies recession. ratio of debt to GDP have depleted the fiscal policy buffer.  If will have less capacity to implement

On the regulatory side, the is designed to be a buffer that, ideally, could be drawn down many other countries, the is currently set at zero.  While the supervisory stress tests do and cannot consider the full range of outcomes and economic factors that are intended to be captured with this tool. On the monetary policy inflation countercyclical capital buffer during bad times.  However, in the United States, unlike countercyclical capital buffer provide some buffer, they have limitations broader a meaningful buffer available in monetary and fiscal policy makes the regulatory buffer more important.  In addition, gradually building a buffer during good consistent with increasing the buffer during a time of a low unemployment rate and The lack of potential times is when many asset classes are experiencing relatively high valuations-an environment in which we currently find ourselves.

a financial stability shock.  If we cannot current framework to do the job, we need to consider other frameworks Thank you, Madam Chair. If, on the other hand, we choose not to build this regulatory buffer, then there is all the more reason for us to have a discussion of whether our current monetary policy framework can serve as the primary buffer against a recession or confidently rely on our that might do it better.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kaplan. CHAIR

Andreas.  Excessive valuation at and of itself doesn't unduly worry me.  It is from here, though, that the accumulation is likely to accompany excess valuation.  I think this is likely going to be in the nonbank is a sector in which we don't have as great a visibility.  And it may well I do think we're at a point MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I agree with this point in of debt financial sector, which occur because of a sudden rise in rates-that is, a rate shock-because

January 30-31, 2018

low rates have been a big part of the asset run-up.  Earnings have improved, but at which valuations have improved much more than the improvement in earnings.

to more and more people who are suggesting that leverage is increasingly at this point.  It may be less transparent how much increased We already talked about high-yield debt spreads and the I'm talking needed to be used to generate returns, which helps explain why margin debt is at record levels. Again, I think this is manageable leverage there is in derivative form. issuance of high-yield debt.

everything I see out there suggests that covenants in these securities are sector, like we saw for a couple of years in energy, think this sector alone is big enough to right now-right now. In addition, lighter than they've been historically, and we all know these funds offer daily liquidity, which means that, should you have a problem in a you can have a very quick gapping out.  Again, I don't create this systemic risk are our discussions we've had here about risk parity strategies, and, again, lower the volatility of the the leverage.  This works great on the way up, or kind of a linear way on the is on the way down.  When prices go down, volatility goes up.  Not only do leverage because the price declined, but you need to cut your leverage allowed-the leverage per unit of asset has to go down because volatility is And then there these are strategies in which you not only leverage the asset, but the asset, the higher way up, because when prices go up, volatility can be low and you can keep your leverage on the way up.  The issue you need to cut your because the dollar higher, which accelerates the decline.

a good feel-and I know we've talked about this.  I know we're monitoring strategy is out there.  You talk to people, and I think they still reassure you in out of control, and I buy that.  And so, all in I don't have how much of this the markets.  They think it's going on, but it's not

January 30-31, 2018

if we could just stop the music right here, it strikes me that we're in pretty good shape, and all, I'm not terribly worried.

where do we go from here?  And I think 2018 and 2019 are going to be we need to be on our toes.  And I hate to harken this, but they remind of me of 2005 1997 and 1998.  And I hope that turns out to be wrong, but-where the volume of were at the end of 2005, we could have think we were having this discussion around the At the end of '06, a little more questionable, and '07, dramatically the rate at which these risks built up, at how fast they built just-it rest of the team do a great job. The issue is, years when and 2006 or mortgage securitizations and credit default swaps stopped there and we would have been fine.  I table-fairly manageable. worse.  And I was stunned myself at up, and I think we were surprised here.  It's the last year or two of the cycle that you doesn't mean it'll happen.  We just have to be on our toes.  So to me, the lessons would be, keep doing our financial stability work and let the as, if not more important than, data that we can measure.  This talking to people who are raising issues.  And I know the New York Fed has talked to a increase those discussions here, I think that would be wise.  I are likely going to tip us off.  I think it's going to have to be with contacts that will give us clues as to where to dig in deeper. Number two, it does strike me that phone calls and discussions with contacts at this stage in the cycle may be as important means number.  I won't mention their names.  In view of the number of prominent money managers who have said, 'Hey, I'm starting to get nervous,' I think those discussions are great, and I've said to my own team, if we could don't think measured data discussions

I could include the insurance I agree completely that for the big banks-and if companies, I would, but I know we can't-tough capital requirements and tough stress testing are needed at this stage of the cycle.  In addition, regular stress testing, I think, is critical.

It could be because of low volatility, and some of it just wouldn't mind if we did a review and asked the question. mainly low volatility, fine.  But if there is a big selloff, there is a question we have the market infrastructure to accommodate the volume, question mark. I do agree with the idea have this selloff, trading volumes might be due to the Volcker rule.  I If it turns out to be mark on whether one reason why I am glad the FOMC is working to wind down to believe that the FOMC would need its balance sheet with all this liquidity in the that you could have a drain of liquidity very reasons why I've shifted in the past six months to believe in that strategy.  Thank you, Madam And this last thing-it is its balance sheet, because in this kind of scenario, if it happened two or three years from now, it's hard world.  I could envision, if this scenario happened, rapidly when we may actually need to use that balance sheet a couple of years from now.  So it's worth keeping in mind.  And this is one of the saying that removal of accommodation patiently but deliberately may well keep that rate shock from happening down the road  Which is why I Chair.

By encouraging institutions at the core of the to build resilience against such an episode, we seek to lessen the severity of the distress to system should asset prices fall and term premiums rise sharply in a challenging Although the scenarios always include severe recessions and prices, year's scenarios, yields on longer-maturity Treasury securities are flat despite short-term falling to zero.

far is that they have become less binding on banks as the recovery has requirements that are based on stress tests alone are unlikely the financial system's natural procyclicality.  For that reason, we also tool in the eponymous countercyclical capital buffer, or the Board can require the nation's largest banks to build an additional margin of capital augment resilience, and it can then release that as the economy weakens. Even with these attempts to give the CCAR process a countercyclical bias, the experience with the stress tests thus gathered strength, undercutting somewhat this countercyclical value.  Of course, that's not surprising, and we know that capital to attenuate completely have a specifically countercyclical CCyB.  The at times of rising cyclical pressures, helping to capital a key input into the decisions surrounding the setting of the CCyB, and the QS report assessing overall risks as moderate and with measures that we routinely assess sending a similar signal, the Board announced its CCyB at its minimum value.

The overall configuration of the financial system is the same as it has been for some months now:  elevated asset prices, a business sector on a lot of debt at the same time that the household-sector debt growth remains that is very strong by historical standards, at least.  It's not surprising that asset prices should be rich at this point in the business cycle. the posttraumatic stress that was in place are a few obvious risks on the horizon:  They're willing to prices for longer-lived assets, such as Bitcoin.

First, I have the overall basically that's taken modest, and a financial system particularly Households and businesses have naturally shed some of following the deep recession.

When asset prices reflect strong fundamentals and a very optimistic outlook, bad news will have

are also particularly important at the moment, and this goes to the point about what we're doing in the stress test this year.  As the staff report on the 'worthies' around this table in controlling Nonetheless, investors could revert to an earlier view, and in doing so push up Term premiums that Lael was making financial stability highlighted, term premiums are very low by historical standards.  There are good reasons for that, not least the success of inflation risk. Treasury yields and force down the prices of risky assets.  And the consequences of such a decline in wealth, occurring alongside an increase in borrowing cost, could be quite painful.

the financial system means, I believe, that these consequences amplified by the system.  So if you look in the Tealbook, the 'Global Market features a version of this result.  Term premiums on Treasury fall 20 percent.  Corporate bond spreads widen.  But macroeconomic consequences in this alternative scenario are only moderate, with the three quarters of a percentage point above its value in the Tealbook projection. Now, the strength of wouldn't be Correction' alternative scenario securities tick up even as U.S. equity prices the unemployment rate only baseline is to be sure that the system is, indeed, this kind of a scenario, as to which there would seem So our job as financial stability policymakers positioned to absorb losses stemming from to be a heightened risk in the current circumstances-that is to say, a material decrease in asset prices at the same time, unusually, as an actual increase in Treasury yields.

And so, as Lael was pointing out, year are designed precisely to build resilience against which again, recession, larger-than-expected decreases Thus, as a consequence, banks that in the past have had a significant contribution to their ability

Yet this stress test is constructed in a way that we think is designed to address an actual real risk, harder for the sake of making it harder. to pass the stress have that contribution.

But with labor to tighten, I would expect wages to accelerate somewhat as well, especially right now in a one-off fashion-for instance, by paying special bonuses.  But that have a longer-lasting effect on compensation, to come back to it at the end of the year Granting of this pot of income is will surely go to shareholders, and a lot of CFOs would like markets continuing where workers have skills in high demand or some degree of bargaining power.

Nevertheless, they to tighten. Other manufacturers also noted the We have been hearing about many of these selective capacity constraints, difficulties ramping up the supply chain, and problems in moving product trucks.  And, of course, they also pointed to a dearth of skilled workers.  The view across my contacts more broadly was that labor markets were tightening throughout the employment spectrum, and there were a few more reports this time of increases in compensation: bonuses, increased profit sharing, and more generous benefits.  Some of these developments were couched in terms of spreading still indicate that the labor market continues

With regard is our current expectation that barrels a day in 2018, and we currently expect the Permian to continue 75 percent of U.S. drilling activity.  So if you back into what we expect U.S. oil production to be as much as 900,000 to 1,000,000 barrels a day in 2018. Those are stunning levels of production-very strong.

analysts are very bullish right now about the outlook for oil prices, we do continue in which prices vary still between the 50s and While to believe that this is going to be a volatile period 60s, even though we're in the 60s right now.  And the forthcoming increased U.S. production is certainly going to put, in our judgment, some downward pressure on prices.

underpinning oil prices is the firming of expectations that global demand was going to grow about 1.3, to approximately 1.6 million barrels a underpinning to the price. One key positive, though, that's regarding global demand.  Because of the synchronous expansion globally, you may have heard me say before that we previously had thought 1.5 million barrels a day.  We have now upgraded that day.  This is a substantial strengthening and is an said before, over the next five years Dallas Fed and our contacts would expect price risks to the upside as major oil companies the trend of avoiding investment in long-lived projects.  They are instead focusing on bite-sized and nimble but has a much more rapid As we've said previously, and I've economists continue shale, which, on the positive side, is more decline curve than long-lived projects.  Given this decline curve and a continued strengthening, if that continues, with global demand, U.S. shale at some point is not going to be able to keep up

We still that. and grow sufficiently in order to keep pace with global demand growth even after factoring in growth in alternative forms of energy.  So this is going to be few years, but three to believe real GDP growth estimates to and our full-year forecast to somewhere between 2½ and 2¾ percent.

As we to further overshoot, though, full employment, I do believe-as I've said earlier-that financial markets.

I may not be as Tealbook at how far the 10-year yield is going to back up, but I do think some rate and the shape of see anything about the shape of the yield curve right now that causes me least three funds rate increases in 2018.  We'll talk more work on this.  A flattening yield curve may be okay, but I am Having said either the 260s or the 270s, I think we certainly have enough operating room to execute our base case in 2018.  It's address bold as the backing up would not be surprising.  So while I'll be watching the 10-year the yield curve, I don't to back away from wanting to see at about this tomorrow.

said, a word on the way companies are going to be higher in cash flow and share prices for many companies. Last comment-echoing what President Barkin dealing with the tax legislation.  There is no question corporate profits are 2018 and beyond-by most estimates, as much as $10 a share in 2018 for the S&amp;P 500.  This translates into substantially greater challenge.  First, about deferred tax writeoffsrate, deferred tax assets.  That's basically not terribly relevant.  It's just balance sheet The interesting issue is the CEO playbook for dealing with this positive most companies, you may notice, are making announcements lower tax adjustments.

an extent even more than people may have anticipated previously.  They are also, in a low end of the wage scale-between $10 and $15 per hour.  And I think some Second, they are also announcing-in many cases, sequentially-that they expect higher EPS, to very choreographed way and not by accident, announcing one-time bonuses and higher wages, particularly at the of these wage increases they might have had to do in any event.  And they are announcing some

January 30-31, 2018

clear how much of it is actually incremental as opposed to an being deliberately vague about the increased capital spending.  It's not aggregation of what they might do, and I think companies are difference.

see a few companies talk about dividend increases and share going to see discussion of this very muted, deliberately, in the first going to also be very careful and very muted, with some These announcements are choreographed, as I said, and should continue for the next number of weeks.  And while you'll buyback, I think you're quarter of the year.  And I think they're exceptions, about discussing head-count reduction plans, even though they are making these plans.  We'll come back to that.

that, some number of months from now, there are going to be a number of might have occurred in the first quarter, I would expect to see in the year or the second quarter and be muted I would expect quiet announcements about dividend increases and share repurchases, probably as quiet as possible.  While some of these most companies would push these off to later about this discussion.

companies I speak with are lamenting their lack of pricing power and the emphasize, not net profit margins, but gross selling price less cost of goods sold.  I agree with Tom that, if anything, a lot of that this tax legislation will accelerate this, and there are even some thought two weeks ago had good pricing power, the tax legislation has induced at least one airline to announce more capacity which now has set off fears of a price war.  We'll see if that happens. Third, most challenge of maintaining gross margins.  And I'd margins-that is, them are concerned industries-airlines being an example-that we and I think some of expansion, workers more, but they also have quiet in technology that will allow them to reduce their workforce Most companies I speak with do plan to pay their plans to focus on investments

And the reason they are doing fear about maintaining gross margin. through attrition, mainly, and buyouts and some multiyear plan, and increases in cap-ex it, again, is at M&amp;A activity more scale to be able to support and protect gross margins, due to their More companies than I have spoken to in years are also actively looking in order, again, to create concern about lack of pricing power.  Those mergers will also likely further lead to workforce reductions.

is going to be, what's going to happen to the worker, her job most likely over the next three years?  Our guess is-and we've this a lot at the Dallas Fed-this worker will probably, in this market, be able to find a retrained, they are likely to see their productivity and their income The challenge in this puzzle probably with a high school education, who is making $55,000 a year, maybe working in a call center, who loses his or debated job, but, unless they get decline.

are some 50 million workers in this country with a high school most acutely affected.  This situation is going to heighten the need for middle-skills retraining and improving educational attainment levels in the United States where By our estimate, there education or less.  President Rosengren talked about even the upper-age element of that, which will be training and we lag significantly other countries.

past number of years, I don't need to tell you, have been marked by a divergence fortunes of the S&amp;P 500 index and the notable sluggishness of real GDP growth and possible that this divergence will come into even sharper relief over is highly likely.  Workers, though, with high school and lower levels of educational The between the nominal wage growth.  It's the next two to three years.  Companies will certainly increase their level of productivity.  I think that

The combination of tax reform and continuing improvement in the global economy has convinced most of our contacts that paraphrase one of my directors, we have collected, and from the modest bump I added to my SEP submission To begin with, the fourth-quarter GDP report indicated end-of-year growth that weaker than I expected, and even that number may be inflated somewhat by the a large global package delivery shift in consumer spending related to the timing of the Consistent with the underlying detail in last household and that these deliveries Nonetheless, viewing the incoming hard data, survey results anecdotal reports in their totality, I'm not persuaded that we know enough to say whether the broad economic picture has changed much in December. was a little hurricane recovery effects.

The broader point is interpret the receiving, is that boost to fourth-quarter growth seems at the tax reform.  On this score, my sense is that the responses to the tax legislation are not fully clear-certainly not clear to me and, their feedback, not clear to the businesses themselves either.  As one director put it, On balance, my contacts echoed exactly what they told lead-up to the December meeting:  Optimism hasn't yet morphed into any significant investment plans. Even if underlying growth did step down at the end of last year, however, the optimism expressed by my contacts is not so much related to momentum coming out of 2018, but rather their views on the prospective effect of the businesses' according to 'We're still working with wet cement.' us in the expansion of capital

While inflation is still of our 2 percent inflation objective, incoming data have increased my confidence up this year. MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The economy is starting the year growth momentum than anticipated at our December gains in falling short that inflation will move growth expectation for the year to around 3 on the basis of three factors.  First, spending by households and businesses was stronger package turned out to be larger and more front-end than expected in December. And, third, tailwinds coming from abroad have intensified. I have tentatively marked up my real GDP percent, in the past few months.  Second, the fiscal loaded

Consumer and business confidence and fundamentals have been strong. In addition, financial with narrow rising equity Fourth-quarter GDP, as David Wilcox pointed out, rose at what appeared to be a disappointing headline rate.  But if you look into the inner workings of that, by taking out the effects of inventory and imports, consumer demand and business demand actually were quite strong.

that the momentum shown in the spending data will be significantly staff analysis of the The staff's estimate is that the Tax Cuts and marginal tax rates and the move to expensing of some capital spending are likely to boost both the supply of labor and increase in the productive capacity of our economy.  Again, the these effects is highly uncertain. I anticipate reinforced by the recently enacted fiscal package.  In that regard, I found the economic effect of the package to be very helpful. Jobs Act will raise annual GDP by roughly ½ percent this year and next, mostly by inducing higher spending by households and businesses.  This seems like a reasonable estimate, although, of course, there's high uncertainty.  I also agree that lower full investment, contributing to some size of economic activity in a broad cross section of countries has also surprised to financial conditions and monetary policies abroad as being The pace of the upside.  Looking ahead, I see supportive of continued strengthening of foreign GDP growth.

of synchronization in global growth is quite striking.  As Lael mentioned, the update noted that 120 or more economies accounting for three-fourths of world GDP pickup in growth in year-on-year terms in 2017.  And, in addition to boosting our exports, the more upbeat outlook for our trading partners should help counter the upward pressure on the dollar as we continue to normalize the stance of our policy.

My overall assessment is that we are near full employment, few indicators, notably nominal wage growth, appear to suggest that there may be participation has now been flat for roughly four years despite demographics and other tightening labor market.  I expect that strong growth will participation in the although a some remaining slack in the labor market.

Despite last year's favorable disappointed, continuing this year.  The performance of inflation has been the skunk at what would otherwise have been a very good year for any central that transitory factors have largely accounted softness in inflation this past year.  Indeed, I do take a bit of solace from the data over the of months, which have shown a rise in inflation from the very low readings at fall, and all of that confidence I have that inflation will move up this year. I continue to see that the staff's assessment for the past couple midyear.  Inflation breakevens have also moved up meaningfully since the adds very modestly to the degree of

As unemployment seems headed well below 4 percent, probably for an a time to remain patient, while also being alert to buildups in both financial vulnerabilities.  More on that tomorrow. So, to sum up, the information received since our meeting upgrade my view of the market is too low for extended period, this is inflation pressures and more to say in a little while, but I would just offer a few thoughts. summary from my perspective might be that your leadership of this Committee and this Now, Janet, I will have A

In any event, it is important to put the shortfall in perspective.  From the what we've managed to achieve.  If not for the loss of credibility that would to follow through on our 2 percent commitment, something that would time and exacerbate the problems posed by the lower bound, we might be tempted to say: 'Close enough.'

Thus, it is not clear, even in hindsight, what, if anything, this Committee should have done public's perspective, low and stable inflation, combined with a strong labor market, is hard to beat.

And after a few additional hikes, short-term rates will only have to move up to pace if and as rises over time.

The estimate for private industry workers total employment cost, hourly compensation, increased 2.6 percent over the 12-month period. That was just a little softer than we had expected.  Wages and salaries came in at a 2.8 rate of increase.  Benefit costs were at 2.3 percent.  The wage-and-salary number was right in line with our expectation.  The benefit cost increase was just a little softer than we had expected. We don't yet have the detail on benefits, so we don't know what the breakdown is and the source of the shortfall.

in 2016, and Looking over the past three years, there has nonetheless been some increase in nominal rates of growth in total hourly compensation-1.9 percent in 2015, 2.2 percent 2.6 percent in 2017-so, some modest acceleration in nominal compensation costs.

So what you found out staff forecast.  And so I guess my question is, what is it in the staff suppose.  Or is this sort of more symptomatic of misspecification, or something like MR. EVANS. here-so, as I understand it, the Laubach-Williams implementation treats the natural interest rate as a nonstationary,  (1), process, I gee, I kind of expect it is something about the forecast that's telling me about  (1) behavior?  Stationary data can change my opinion of I I (1) behavior, I that?

[Laughter]  So, of course, the Laubach-Williams model, lot of things that we might know about-for the staff will take into consideration in putting together its projection. MR. LAUBACH.  Let like as you know, is really-and I highlight that-only just looking at real GDP, inflation, and interest rates.  So it doesn't know about a whole example, factors minds, of course, we are always thinking about the question, the fundamental drivers of this?  One should understand that Laubach-Williams is a a statistical thing.  But we think that there are some structural stories going on that we like to tell involve variables like trend that tend to be very gradually moving processes, we think. Now, in the back of our what are black box, it's here in the background.  Most of the stories productivity growth, demographics

So this rapid decline during the financial you look at such sharp movement anywhere else in the are also other factors that make it into our estimate such as, for example, a sudden sharp increase in risk aversion.  That would be one factor or not?  Well, our model, take a very mechanistic approach.  It just looks constellation of the data, and it lumps a certain amount of the unexplained, one-step-ahead component, and that's it lets the error terms in the equations absorb.

So when I look at this one possible interpretation, it factors that we are frequently emphasizing-like trend growth and slow productivity growth and demographics-there was a very persistent and unusual development during the financial It could be a sharp increase in risk aversion.  It could be, as I yesterday, that the recession was so much driven by the the model would basically assign a certain portion of that weakness to the say, 'Well, okay.  In some sense, the this bit right, because some of these, I may think of them as 20-, deleveraging, I may think after a while, you've model just sticks it into this component. So then, when you think about that, you might model here isn't quite getting 30-, 40-year developments, like demographics, and about others, like of them as 10-year developments.  Okay?'  And then it's conceivable that, worked through something that, by historical standards, has been just unusually persistent, and therefore, the

I mean, this is a statement about the Tealbook forecast. amazingly optimistic.  It's got growth-I wrote it all down hereyear, 2 percent the year after, roughly, rounding off, with the I don't think actually there's a lot of that if we're going to raise rates, at least I SEP, to 4.8 percent, we would still deliver that growth.  Now, right.  I'm not criticizing their view, but it is a very optimistic view And President Evans is The Tealbook forecast is 3 percent this year, 2.5 percent next funds rate going to 4.8 percent by the end of 2020.  Well, people around this table who have that same view: think, according to the December the staff may be completely of a strong, above-trend economy, with the funds rate getting up to well above neutral in the next few years.

Laubach-Williams model is showing is that, hey, if you feed in a of rate increases, the model is going to tell you be higher than the original estimate.  I don't think from what Thomas is saying.  But I am very sympathetic to the view mean, that's a possibility, but there's nothing in the that. And what I think the really optimistic view of the economy with a lot the underlying strength in the economy must I've said anything different that we haven't seen this, and the discussion that the Vice Chairman brought up yesterday about secular stagnation versus Reinhart-Rogoff-I data yet that supports that we're going to see a fundamental shift upward, whether it's fiscal policy or global growth or some of the other things that we talked about.  But think that it's really important to separate short-term cyclical dynamics-which are positive, in demographics, productivity, and the demand for safe these trends, I don't-at least not yet-really see such shifts.  So I think actually this And it's clearly possible arising from I do absolutely-from the longer-term trends assets.  For

CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman.

DUDLEY. Can I ask President Williams just a quick question?  So in terms informing your view of which regime you're in?  Now, it's possible that just reacting to the fact that real rates are really low, and it does take a long rates.  Or, conversely, it could take a view are easing are due to the fact that the headwinds associated the financial crisis are abating.  How do you fit all the things that we're seeing in financial trying to discriminate between different views of which regime VICE CHAIRMAN how do you-and Thomas, too-take in the whole constellation of what is happening, of financial markets, in financial markets are time for financial markets to adjust to that low level of that, no, the financial conditions that with conditions into the process of we're in?

MR. WILLIAMS.  Let me start.

DUDLEY. Because your model doesn't really have any of them in VICE CHAIRMAN it.

And the New York Fed has their DSGE r *, which I think is great, and the Richmond Fed has their own model.  So there just do the secular stagnation story.  I'm not a supporter of the the secular-stagnation view, but I think that that view is informative for how You know, let me strongest version of

If you believe that is essentially zero different periods, but I think the analysis that the has done on commercial real estate, house prices, and the stock market is all basically the notion that prices make sense if you have a view of a very low value of the term premium.  So I think there is consistency in that world. to r * , or half a percentage point, or something very low, then you would expect asset valuations to be basically where they are today.

But it could not convinced that it's the fact that we're in a frothy me that we're not in something low And so that in a secular-stagnation world, it's you've got confidence high and the stock market really high and things also be a sign that we are in an unsustainable situation, in terms of fiscal policy or financial markets or both.

DUDLEY.  I'm not convinced either.  I'm just putting it on the table. VICE CHAIRMAN I think there's more tension between those two views than there was before.

Could I add one element of ambiguity to the picture, please?  [Laughter] MR. WILCOX. MR. QUARLES.  Better than anyone we know.

Tealbook is very optimistic in the spectrum of current outside forecaster opinion.  However, I do think it's MR. WILCOX.  I agree with the observation that the comparison with

January 30-31, 2018

track record of our forecasts lately.  And I would note that, for example, as the middle of 2015, we were expecting the unemployment rate at the end of 2017two years hence-we were expecting the unemployment rate to finish 2017 at 5 to 4 percent. good to look at the recently as so, at that point, percent.  In fact, as you well know, it finished very close the FOMC delivered a more accommodative monetary the staff had incorporated into the forecast.  That's the element of ambiguity So, unemployment declined faster.  On the other hand, that was in the monetary policy that was more accommodative than we had assumed.  So how the but the chart I'm looking at the 2017 evolution of unemployment rate forecast. Now, what's also true is that policy than what that I was referring to. context of a balance of those two factors works out I can't perform for you right now, looking at for reference is on page 33 of Tealbook A, and I'm the

in this regard, but I agree that we we were that far progress on the unemployment rate, that's been than we had anticipated a couple of years ago. So past performance is no indication of future outcomes are currently at the optimistic end of the spectrum.  I'm not sure, actually, that off, stepping back to 2015.  With regard to the more rapid

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Bullard.

this is the crucial issue, I think, for the Committee.  And I liked Bill's comments yesterday also secular-stagnation idea with the Reinhart-Rogoff idea. MR. BULLARD.  Well, I appreciate the comments on this, and I do think that really about comparing and contrasting the that, for the purposes of what we're doing around the table here, when you like this, you should just assume that you are going to stay in the low regime at the next 18 months or two years, that kind of horizon.  It could be, and you have to be that it's I have just felt look at a picture least over alert and pay attention, and I understand we might want to hedge our bets, but I just felt

January 30-31, 2018

saying that, well, all of a sudden, the mean reversion is going to kick in in for quite a while. conceptually better than after it hasn't kicked factors that are driving this, which there are three of them:  productivity, demographics, and safe assets-we've done a back-of-the-envelope type of calculation in which all driving them.  And I think productivity looks like still in the low state.  It's moved up, but it's not enough to say you're going to the high state is ambiguous, and the demand for safe assets is really the big kahuna.  And, to the Reinhart-Rogoff idea-maybe it is, sure we should bet on it as a Committee.  That's been my thinking. And also, on this characterization of the fundamental have already been mentioned-I think demand for three of those have regime-switching processes it's yet.  Demographics you know, whether that's abating now-that would get but I'm not

But if you the picture right now, this black line is actually negative as of today.  Thank you, Madam If you take those three factors and have them safe assets that changing.  We do have look at Chair.

And while inflation will reach our goal by next year. MR. WILLIAMS.  The data continue to exceed an above-potential tax changes remains somewhat below target, I expect that we conditions, we will need to rein in the economy somewhat to achieve the relative to long-run levels.  Given this outlook, I strongly endorse the language signals continued gradual normalization and leans into a rate hike In my forecast, the unemployment rate is below 4 percent even as we reach our inflation goal.  And under those soft landing that we are seeking.  And I expect that this will eventually entail some overshooting in our policy rate in alternative B that I believe at our March meeting.

January 30-31, 2018

this year, as normalization continues, I think we do need to revisit language in paragraph 4.  In particular, the current language states that the is likely to remain for some time below levels that are expected to prevail in language is clearly accurate, at least on the basis of the SEP I do think this shopworn.  I do believe it proved useful in the wake of the to convince skeptics about the Committee's lower-for-longer projected policy rate likely going to be the opposite.  That is, namely, clarifying that than is that we consider dropping prepare us for the possibility, perhaps late this year or next to actually state the reverse-namely, that the federal funds rate is likely for some time above levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. Looking ahead further the forward-guidance federal funds rate the longer run.  Now, although this submissions that we put in in December, and it will be true for another year or so, language is starting to become a bit crisis, in order path.  But now our challenge is economic conditions will likely require a somewhat tighter path for the policy rate reflected in financial market expectations.  So I suggest later this year this particular phrase.  And this will year, that we may need to move that the language-switching happens very time to then at least a meeting or two, something And I think the thing we want to avoid is abruptly: we go from saying that we are going to be below normal for quite some saying we are going to be above normal.

Growth is expected to remain markets are expected to tighten further, and inflation is expected to firm and context, a gradual upward path in the funds rate continues to be dual-mandate goals.  The actual path of the funds rate will depend on how yet, but I think pausing today to reacting to the tax package, is sensible.

I think we need to be prepared to act more quickly should some of be realized.  The question is, how to do that without causing an oversteepening of policy rate path expectations.

flexibility to our last statement, alternative B is, appropriately, more positive about the real bit more positive about the inflation outlook.  It indicates that the expects that further gradual increases, rather than gradual increases, in rates will this will signal that the Committee sees a rate path or steeper path or both as likely.  I'm not convinced that the words themselves this the staff expects. So, in my view, the goal of today's statement is to give the Committee the do so, and to keep market expectations in alignment.  I believe alternative B does that. Compared with economy and perhaps a Committee likely be warranted.  The Tealbook indicates that higher actually mean anything different, but the fact that the Committee has made a change to wording will be noticed and may very well be interpreted as the challenges in our communications, my heart does long for the day that we can actually say what we mean in the support both the action and Chair.

[Laughter]  She on the record one of those that just happened in the past year, which is wind-down of the balance sheet.  I think it was a very sensitive issue for the Committee-a I did just want to mention that, as Chair, Janet has so much background and experience with the Fed that she's just been excellent as a Chair and has handled many situations brilliantly. And I just wanted to put the

I think she, first, decided that we needed to do something, then we had a lot of discussions here at the Committee, we put together a plan, and we announced it in June. That whole way to communicate to markets and has worked out very well.  That was have gone very differently had we had less organized leadership, I think, than what we had on that.  So, Janet, congratulations, and thank you for your service to the FOMC and to the nation.

YELLEN.  Thank you so much, Jim.  I really appreciate that. CHAIR

MR. BULLARD.  So for today's policy choice, I am going to line up with John here and say I support option B.  But I do have a few comments.

a few changes.  [Laughter] CHAIR YELLEN.  Just they have moved up.  They are not at levels quite that are, I think, consistent MR. BULLARD.  I do support the TIPS language in option B.  I do think we should acknowledge that with our 2 percent inflation target on a PCE basis.  So I think we should include the blue phrase in paragraph 1.

think the 'further' is going to be taken as quite 'hawkish' in this situation.  Bonds are selling off as we We want to becoming a lot more 'hawkish' and is thinking about a steeper pace of increase.  I word. And then, in paragraph 4, I would oppose adding the word 'further.'  I language speak, and this word addition here, I think, is going to line up Wall Street on a four-rate-hike world for 2018, and I just don't think it's necessary to commit to that at this point. keep our options open and see what happens.  I think the perception is already that the Committee is don't think we need to fan the flames here by including this

January 30-31, 2018

the phrase 'federal funds rate is likely to remain for some time below the levels run.'  My preferred approach is actually to take this whole point at which zero bound and moving up.  We're more in a normal phase in which we move the interest rate around in various ways, depending on what happens.  So I don't I continue to think, along with President Williams, that we do need to fix paragraph 4, especially expected to prevail in the longer sentence out, which is what option A does, because I think we're beyond the we're coming off the might think we need this kind of guidance in the statement any more, and I think we do need to do something about it.

limiting our need to be more nimble and need to have more approach in which every It make intertemporal tradeoffs.  We might not do something at one come about. I also think it's time to get going on the press-conference issue.  That's ability to move.  I think the Committee will now options open, depending on what happens with the economy.  I see an meeting is, ex ante, identical as being the more normal mode of behavior for the Committee. allows the Committee to meeting, but we might do it at the next meeting, depending on how developments past.  And I think, if we can we will be able to move closer to making the right time.  I think in the past few years, we have been in situations in which run-up to the meeting, the data might not have the way we anticipated, and then we felt like we had to go ahead anyway that was our opportunity to do it.  So I am hopeful that we can move in that direction press-conference-at-every-meeting mode, which is what other central banks do I think that's often how decisions have been made here in the make every meeting look exactly the same, then right decision at the we basically penciled in moves, and then in the been cooperating quite because and go to a around the world.

and the step-down in inflation after of below-target performance has posed a conundrum for policy over the past few time of full me greater confidence in MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The disconnect between the signals we have received of continued strengthening in the labor market many years quarters.  But the addition of sizable and front-loaded fiscal stimulus at a employment, synchronized global growth, and a weakening dollar gives the outlook for inflation.

the incoming data suggest the economy has been growing strongly and the recently tax cuts should impart still further stimulus, the strength on the real side isn't reflected inflation.  Core PCE inflation moved down and was only 1½ percent in 2017. the past year or so, and survey measures of inflation expectations remain subdued. appropriate to hold rates steady at this meeting, as in B. While enacted yet in prior Moreover, as the data this morning again show, there has been little upward movement in wage gains over On balance, for those reasons, I think it's alternative intermeeting period, which is to add the bracketed language noting just inconsistent with the approach we Measures of inflation compensation have moved up in the very welcome.  Nonetheless, it wouldn't be my preference that upward movement in inflation compensation.  That is adopted earlier, in 2017, when we did not move or comment as inflation compensation moved down by more, and the downward movement was sustained for many months.  We never acknowledged the downward movement, and the recent movements in inflation compensation, while welcome, only partially retrace the downward movement we saw in 2017.

that it may be part of a broader pattern in which we a bit asymmetric in taking on board data developments-particularly inflation, for that confirm our biases, but we're slower to take on Now, why does that matter?  I worry tend to be which we tend to take note of developments

January 30-31, 2018

that move in the other direction.  So although I will be comfortable going the Committee, I do think we need to be attentive to that inadvertent bias.  I'm used the word 'transitory' in the minutes to the downward surprise in inflation last year, it would greatly exceed any discussion of movement was actually much larger.  This yesterday.  Insofar as inflation expectations matter careful about any possibly regarding what data developments we choose to acknowledge might priority that we place on addressing the inflation undershoot. board developments along with guessing that if we count the number of times we discuss the transitory nature of the upward surprise in inflation in 2016, even though the staff's decomposition suggests that transitory upward matters for the reasons we discussed importantly in determining underlying trend inflation, we'd want to be inadvertent biases and communicate about the think we actually need to comment on inflation compensation.  The language on rate path signals clearly the upside risk to the rate path.  The change in language to we now expect further gradual increases in the federal funds rate, not just once in both paragraphs 2 and 4, is significant and will be noted.  And, indeed, as we look to the risks seem tilted to the upside.  Growth in private final domestic demand likely to remain robust.  The sizable fiscal stimulus totaling 1½ percentage points of GDP are exceptionally supportive. I don't the future emphasize that but twice coming quarters, looks will likely give the economy a further boost.  Global growth looks likely to remain a tailwind, and financial conditions

today in many respects is the mirror image of in oil prices, fiscal stimulus generating tailwinds, the reverse As I noted yesterday, the conjunctural mix what we encountered in 2015 and '16.  In that earlier period, anemic global demand and downside surprises, together with a soaring dollar, a sharp downward movement and waning fiscal support posed strong headwinds that sapped the momentum of the recovery. Today, with global conditions and considerable

January 30-31, 2018

period, the combined headwinds conspired to slow and policy rate path in relation to the rate projections in the SEP, the tailwinds likely to coming quarters may pose upside risks to the SEP's projected path of the policy could hold true.  Just as, in the earlier soften the prevail over rate.

that any such adjustment is likely to be tempered.  Inflation continues can be difficult to raise the slow-moving underlying inflation trend several years, but the anticipated boost to the provide opportunistic reflation. But I'd emphasize to run below our target and has had a long period of underperformance.  As our discussion yesterday highlighted, it that's been running below our objective for economy may well present us with a chance to the hint of such an approach with the release of the December SEP. real economy, December SEP certainly spoke certainly stand ready to adjust the path as warranted, I think it's also to continue to emphasize our commitment to meeting our inflation objective and, in We have already seen Many observers remarked that, despite a notably stronger median outlook for the the median funds rate path was unchanged.  In that regard, the volumes.  Thus, while I important particular, to emphasize its symmetric nature.

thing I'd say is, I have said in previous meetings that I agree with the made by President Williams and President Bullard that the forward guidance in paragraph in our communications and does not create inadvertent sharp reactions.  Thank you, I guess the final points 4 is stale and needs to be adjusted.  And I think the question is just when to do that in a way that is clear Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  So before we go on, I'd just like to clarify the issue of what we've past.  Were you referring, Governor Brainard, to late 2014, when inflation CHAIR done in the compensation moved down?

January 30-31, 2018

referring to 2017.  So I think we got a boost to inflation stimulus.  We movement down in inflation compensation in 2017-again, perhaps as market taking on board a lower probability of fiscal stimulus that they had previously And the most recent movements, I think, retrace, not quite fully, the earlier we saw in 2017.  I think in 2017 we had a discussion and decided not to take on statement those downward movements, and so, in that sense, this movement meeting as opposed to over two or three meetings.  But I do think that it's a bit MS. BRAINARD.  No.  I'm compensation as we went into 2017, perhaps associated with expectations of fiscal then saw a participants were anticipated. movements board or note in the is over one asymmetric, since in effect we are getting back to where we were early in 2017.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Thomas.

may be perhaps a little bit driven by the fact that the Committee the way the decline over May to it didn't show up during one particular intermeeting period.  So I can tell you that, are typically looking at, the largest decline occurred in the intermeeting June meeting, and that was on the order of about 16 basis points.  And look at what the Committee has done in the past, movements when they reached 20 basis points or more over the this is the precedent that seems to be MR. LAUBACH.  This has typically focused on intermeeting movements, and maybe June 2017 took place was in intermeeting movements such that, overall, there was a sizable decline, but by the measure that we period leading up to the so, you know, this is arbitrary, but when we just it typically commented on these intermeeting period.  This is not hard science, but established.

YELLEN.  And that is certainly what we did in 2014.  In October, we said that In December, there was a 22 basis point fall.  We said they was a further 18 basis point fall, and we said CHAIR they had 'declined somewhat.' 'declined somewhat further.'  By January, there

it moved, I think the real question is, does the Committee take some signal from it make the Committee more optimistic that inflation is more likely to go back to our I think paragraph 1 is factual.  We talk about things that are factually actually having put factually correct things, in assessing the outlook.  And I think that is really VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think, fundamentally, rather than go into how many basis points this?  Does 2 percent objective? correct.  But the decision to put in things that are factually correct reflects our some weight on those the fundamental question.

inflation me a little bit more optimistic that we are going to make progress to highlight it.  But it's the fact that I would actually take some signal completely reasonable for you not to take a Now, speaking for myself, I take a little bit of signal from the increase in compensation.  It makes toward our 2 percent objective, and so that's why I think it's appropriate not so much the 16 versus 20.  It's really more from it.  And different people could-you know, it's

from the earlier moves down in inflation a time when inflation data actually surprised quite a were very cautious in the downward movement.  So I just want to make sure that inadvertently signaling that we take more seriously data that move in one direction, than the other.  But, again, I am obviously going to consensus on this. MS. BRAINARD.  So I took signal compensation, which happened to occur at bit to the downside, and that downside surprise persisted.  But, again, we that period and did not acknowledge we are not which happens to confirm our bias, rather support the

My view continues to be that we got ahead of ourselves in December, range could support an increase in inflation toward 2 percent. the inflation first few months of the year.  If we get to our June meeting and we have more MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I'm current target range but I still see how our current However, to do so I would favor keeping policy on hold until June in order to assess data for the confidence and inflation is moving up substantially, then further rate increases would be warranted.

I continue to pause.  There is no pressing need while there are heavier costs to if the actual data turn out to be disappointing. On the basis of the appropriate rate three times this year at press conferences, if that think that risk-management considerations warrant such a brief to move sooner solely on the basis of our inflation forecast, moving prematurely

I don't see the benefit of adding language like 'further' in paragraphs 2 and 4 to modify future additional suggests.

It says it has increased but is to be a factual statement.  The issue of what the appropriate it or not is going to be a bit arbitrary, I guess, but I'm it.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

So I the right way to express the facts in paragraph 1. MR. QUARLES.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as addition of the bracketed language.  I completely agree with the point Chairman, which is, whether do we think that think that that's recent economic performance and the size of the upward revision of the staff it's important that we communicate and the upgrading of the inflation outlook will send that signal.

And so the addition of the word 'further' outlook at strong as it is, I thought Particularly, I think we should start giving some thought to removing the funds rate is likely to remain other members of the Committee have noted.  In view of rate path expected by

I would be substituted- particularly that one sentence that the past 20 years, so I believe that we of the federal funds rate.

But I can also that would call for a prolonged pause.  Thus, we may need to adopt language MR. HARKER.  In addition to that, I believe there is elevated uncertainty regarding the appropriate path for actions. envision outcomes that enhances future flexibility.

the Phillips curve may be lurking in the shadows, there's too much evidence that it is theoretically.  Therefore, I am uncomfortable basing my policy Now, as I mentioned yesterday, my and my staff's view on the Phillips curve leads me to have reservations regarding its value as a guide for policy.  While there is some scant evidence that unreliable both empirically and decisions largely on current and forecast trajectories of low and declining unemployment.

the new do believe, as I've said before, that the best opportunity for extending this expansion to remove accommodation in a consistent and gradual manner in that means starting in March.  I think three increases is a good base case, but if wrong, in my judgment, there may need to be a fourth.  And I do think it's critical to to have that fourth increase as an option, the press conference meetings. MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B with language.  I would be for this Committee 2018, and for me the three is start in March, so we have the opportunity realistically taking into account regarding the shape of the yield curve, as I said yesterday, funds rate and 270-ish on the 10-year, we've got operating flexibility neutral stance.

I do agree, as we approach it, depending on what we decide-I agree about flagging that in the language.  I'm just not sure going to get. So, for me, I would like neighborhood, as I said before, of to do once with President Williams's comments exactly how much beyond that we're need more tools beyond the fed funds rate, and we're going to need a usable balance in a world that might be experiencing, as hard as it is to imagine right now, a credit crunch, very, very So, last comment.  Because I do believe the neutral rate or the terminal rate may be lower than we're historically accustomed, I am again very pleased that we're making progress in running down the balance sheet, because I think we're going need it.  While the world has substantial liquidity right now, I could certainly envision a scenario in which the FOMC is going to certainly sheet a liquidity crunch, and widening credit spreads, and I think our balance sheet will be critical.

Currently, it seems that nobody believes we will move rates at anything than a press conference meeting.  Like President Bullard, I don't think this is a good thing.

I do think we it would be appropriate to revisit the forward guidance a gradual rate path and, as others have noted, the language in paragraph 4. MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B with language, and I continue may be reaching a point, though, at which associated with

Monetary Policy Strategies section of Tealbook A notes that the stronger outlook for the medium term has widened the projected output gap considerably and to noticeably higher funds rate prescriptions from both simple rules and optimal in the Tealbook baseline funds rate assumption.  With unemployment rate in the Tealbook now projected to bottom out a full 1½ percentage points its estimate of the longer-run level and inflation projected to move above the longer-run The economic activity over contributed control policies, as well as an upward shift the below

baseline federal funds rate peaks at 5 percent in 2021, a rate well above objective, the Tealbook current market pricing.

for an stock of these ongoing deviations. The Committee has previously emphasized headwinds as a rationale for deviating extended period from prescriptions of standard monetary policy rules.  As those headwinds begin to shift, we should take at this stage in the expansion, with the Tealbook outlook showing rate projected to reach 3.2 percent, its lowest level since 1953, our adjustments over the more flexibility to respond to the outlook My own view is that the unemployment communications may need to shift from ensuring a gradual path of rate forecast horizon to language that gives the Committee and its uncertainties while maintaining a long-run focus.

You know, we work very hard, all of us, to be nonpolitical and exist in a partisan, political world.  That tension falls on your shoulders than anybody else's, and I think that you've navigated that tension brilliantly and with we're all absolutely grateful for your leadership.  So thank you. MR. KASHKARI. nonpartisan, and yet we more grace.  And is, I hope that, in whatever you choose to do next, you will keep active.  I think the country will benefit to continue to hear your wise counsel on The last thing I'll say your voice important policy matters.

With regard to the policy decision, I support alternative A at this think the real-side economy is looking stronger-and I'm happy about that-and the does remain low, and expectations remain low. MR. KASHKARI. meeting.  I unemployment rate is low.  But inflation recent moves, but I also took signal when they moved in Vice Chairman Dudley and Governor Brainard can both be I do take some signal from the the other direction.  And I think that

January 30-31, 2018

an asymmetric risk.  I think we are more correct, because I do think that we see inflation as concerned as a Committee about high inflation than we are about low inflation, and that's why this tension was revealed in this discussion.

to reconcile the strong real economy and the modest environment is that I think that labor slack may still remain, as I mentioned yesterday, labor force participation.  Because slack may remain and remains below target, I think some monetary accommodation remains appropriate.  The estimates a current neutral real federal funds rate of 0.5 percent.  The current federal is around 1.5 percent.  So the real rate right now is 0.1 percent.  Thus, by this estimation, we're currently providing about to me today. The most plausible way for me inflation expressing itself in a low prime-age inflation Tealbook funds rate is 1.4 percent, and core PCE around slightly negative 60 basis points of accommodation, which doesn't seem excessively accommodative rule-based federal rate path.  And this isn't a criticism of the staff-I know they're going through a in 2018, the federal funds rate reaching 4.8 percent at the end of 2020-I think that this reminds me Looking forward, we discussed this morning the Tealbook's Taylor funds mechanical exercise-but it strikes me as very aggressive.  Penciling in six increases with of why none of us want to be constrained to following religiously a Taylor rule-type forecast because it leads to these kinds of outcomes.

previous meetings, I think, that if we inverted the yield curve for four trigger a recession.  All for what?  To prevent the inflation rate credible scenario. We've discussed at or five years, we would likely from getting above 2.1 percent.  That's just not a staff's output gap forecast is too optimistic.  With labor force participation is probably smaller than they think.  And I am concerned that, I think that the where it is, I think the output gap

more rate increases, it is possible that we could invert the yield curve and recession.  So we should pay close attention to that. with two or three increase the risk of alternative policy that many members of the Committee have been speaking out about.  In a low zero lower bound, I understand the intellectual rationale for alternative frameworks.  I've said previously that I don't think the public will ever support view this as a somewhat academic discussion. The last comment-I want to spend a moment talking about the various frameworks r * environment in the proximity of the these us raising our inflation target.  So I

a path to raise the federal funds rate in a low-inflation environment.  And We're doing that because people are concerned about the unemployment getting too high.  Now, we adopt, for example, a price-level target.  We have a future recession.  We're coming to make up.  Now, imagine that as concerned about the unemployment prices getting too So we're on why are we doing that? rate getting too low, nonlinearity in the inflation process, and asset prices imagine out of the recession, and we have a big inflation shortfall inflation is above 2 percent.  Aren't we going to be just rate getting too low, about nonlinearity in the inflation process, and about asset high?

At the same modest rise in inflation in recent months and the increase in breakevens since the fall inflation will move up this year.  That, of course, the risk remains that inflation will continue to disappoint on the Since the December meeting, expectations strengthened, and the already tight labor market is likely to become even time, the have somewhat increased my confidence that remains to be seen, and downside.

And I in agreement with President Kaplan and, I think, some others in suggesting that the But the risks to inflation are now two sided.  We unemployment falling meaningfully below 4 percent for a sustained period.  I hasten to add that low unemployment The question is whether, deep into a very long expansion with buoyant sentiment, high and rising asset prices, a big tax cut, and still-accommodative monetary form of overheating in the economy in the form would be record shows that we are likely to see such buildups at some point.

So I continue to think that a gradual between avoiding an overheating economy and bringing inflation back up to 2 percent sustained basis.  And in my view, the improved outlook could well call for a pace a bit faster than that implied by

I'm thing that people have said that gives me a little bit of pause is what Jim Bullard beginning, on 'further.' I mean, what does it mean?  If it means anything, it means four.  I think the market is already thinking about that and has moved, so I think I can live with that or without it.  And I rest is fine.

when to lose the sentence in paragraph 4, I think there are two times when I at the March meeting [laughter].  But the time is clearly coming, and the time will this year.  And I think when we get ready to do that, we should dropping hints and that sort of thing. In terms of would not want to do it-the first is today [laughter], and the second time I don't want to do it is in March, come for that sometime later probably be the very sharp drop in is hard for some of us to square with the thought that very long-term, slowand productivity are really responsible for it.  It's easier to appetite for safe assets.  And I don't make the argument that we see any thought that some of that very reversed in-even a significant I'll gratuitously offer a brief comment on r * , which is just that Thomas's picture moving things like demographics think about it in terms of increase in r * today.  I guess I would just say I'm open to the sharp decrease of basically 2 full percent in a year could be

January 30-31, 2018

going to happen, but I'm open to amount could be reversed.  I don't see it.  I'm not saying it's the idea that it could.

Neel just shared, many around the table have expressed a thought that will time at the zero lower bound, and, our framework.  I agree with that sentiment, and I think this look like good years, we have time to do this carefully and thoughtfully, so I do Finally, as r * remain low for a long time, and that will imply more therefore, it's a good time to look at is a good time to embark on a process of looking at that.  And, you know, when we we're seeing a couple of intend that we'll have discussions of the FOMC of our existing framework and possible changes and alternatives beginning later this year and, undoubtedly, stretching well into next year.

timing for getting started on something like that would be around midyear fill out the new team. I would point out, as you know, we're in the early stages of a transition here at the Board and on the FOMC, with two more new Vice Chairs and several other new faces up and down the hall.  So I think the when we start to

I think every beginning Chair wants the message to be one of the team fully in place can be confusing and unsettling.  I I think we all need to keep that in mind and be a little patient For now, I would stress that continuity, and I certainly do, at least at the beginning.  So I think launching an in-depth discussion about framework without don't think it has been so far, but and proceed carefully.

fundamental change.  It's just as big as or bigger than adopting the inflation lot of thought about that here, and we'll be in a position to come back and consult also going to be a need to consult with external It's such a target.  It's going to be highly consequential, so we need, first of all, a really careful plan.  We're devoting a with the Committee pretty soon, I think.  There's

January 30-31, 2018

Congress.  So, again, we're devoting thought to a careful constituencies, definitely including the plan, and we'll want everyone's thinking on that pretty soon.

don't know what the outcome is going to be or that there will be, really, a think we should remain cautious in our messaging, which I think has think we should highlight that the current framework is working well, the strong and growing, and, in evaluating our framework, we're just making sure that to fulfill our mandate in all states of the world.  So that's what I had to say on Finally, we decisive outcome.  So I been fine so far.  I economy is we've got the tools that.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman. CHAIR

DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as that our reading of the a bit more upbeat on growth, and that we're becoming somewhat less worried about for inflation persistently undershooting our 2 percent objective. VICE CHAIRMAN amended with the bracketed language.  I think it's important to signal economy is the prospect fixed investment, and it acknowledges the increase in inflation compensation.  I actually 2 and 4 because I think it reinforces the that more monetary policy tightening lies ahead.  It may not change, necessarily, the I think we're more confident that we're going to be having to raise rates in the year that inflation is expected to move up this year, which I think taken as a signal that we are a bit more optimistic about making progress to our inflation I think the statement does this.  Paragraph 1 upgrades the assessment of consumption and business favor the insertion of the word 'further' in paragraphs message median, but ahead.  Paragraph 2, I think, notes will be objective.

these changes together, I hope this will be taken as the Committee being possibility that maybe So, taking all of even more inclined to tighten monetary policy in 2018 and hinting at the

that may be pretty relevant to us March FOMC meeting, and that's the debt limit.  You know, most observers expect the Treasury will exhaust its cash balance and extraordinary measures sometime during the There's a lot of uncertainty about the precise timing because tax quite large and variable this time of year.  So that could move around a lot.  But FOMC meeting, it could be a really substantive issue. I'm going to switch gears and just want to flag one issue before our that first two weeks of March. refunds are probably before the next that this follows the normal course, that we have the fire drill and in time, cooler heads prevail, and the debt limit gets raised substantially way.  But with the polarization in politics that I see today, I actually am a little bit than I have been in the past-that there would just be a risk of a meet its obligations, which I view as terribly damaging.  And I think we'd to, as a Committee, just be very consistent in that message that this is not something around with.  Regardless of what actually ultimately occurs, this is going to require quite System over the next few weeks just to make sure with any eventuality. Now, obviously, I hope the fire drill is resolved in a timely more worried about this miscalculation or a mistake, or the legislation won't arrive on time to prevent a disruption of the nation's ability to really need to mess a bit of attention within the Federal Reserve that we're able to cope

Chair.  Yesterday evening, we had a commitment to the Federal Reserve and to the the Fed.  I think it's a view broadly shared that, in the modern the Federal Reserve, you have a record that is unrivaled not only in terms of both duration Finally, some further closing remarks about our chance to honor you, Janet, and recognize your country and your achievements at era of and endurance, but also in terms of, which is more important, success.

January 30-31, 2018

the Board of Governors in the mid-1990s, you made a intellectual case for a price-stability target with inflation above zero.  I went back by how much weight your comments carried that day in both influencing and in your comments that day, recognizing even back in 1996 the of too-low inflation and the risks of being pinned at the zero lower bound for interest Starting as a member of compelling recently and read the July 1996 FOMC transcript.  I was struck by two things:  first, not only by how easily you held your own-you were the least-tenured Governor at the FOMC that daybut, second, also foreshadowing how the FOMC's thinking on inflation and price stability would evolve over time.  You showed great foresight dangers rates.

Advisers after that too-short then went back to University of California, Berkeley, you came back as the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in 2004.  In that role, you provided very aggressive policy response that we had during the financial crisis.  When I the Federal Reserve in 2007, I was really pleased to see where I got to sit at the FOMC I was sitting right where Simon is sitting, right next to where you were sitting as president to start-to have someone who had a lot more I could learn from. You know, after you went away to the Council of Economic time here and president of the strong support for the joined table. of the San Francisco Fed.  That was a good place experience than I did whom the Federal Reserve Board.  I was very pleased about me to have the chance to work with Ben Bernanke and you as we dealt In 2010, you became Vice Chair of that because it meant we were going to be able to work even more closely together.  You certainly had big shoes to fill with Don Kohn's retirement, but you obviously did so very ably.  It was really gratifying for with some pretty interesting problems during that time-the constraint of the zero lower bound, innovating with forward guidance, and successive rounds of quantitative easing.

January 30-31, 2018

think everyone accepts that you have also creative leadership, and that's a very to that. Finally, in 2014, you succeeded Ben as Chair.  I consistently shown not just disciplined leadership, but unusual combination.  You've reached out to others on the FOMC, which I think forged a strong consensus.  This is really a very united Committee, in my opinion, and I think you contributed greatly gotten us very, very close to our dual-mandate objectives.  It's take a well-deserved bow and to move on to your next endeavor-one, I hope, little bit less pressure, one in which you'll have room to speak a little bit and one in which you won't have to 'prep' for quarterly press conferences or listen around this table telling you that you need to do press conferences at every meeting. Those suggestions now go to Governor Powell.  Thank you, Madam Chair. Most important, you've not a bad time to in which there'll be a more freely, to people [Laughter]

YELLEN.  Well, I want to thank everyone for your wonderful comments.  I can't serve the Federal Reserve in so many different capacities over such a long time, Chair.  And this is a wonderful group.  I have thoroughly enjoyed interacting with CHAIR tell you how much they mean to me.  As I said last night, it has been an incredible honor and a privilege to particularly as all of you and with our terrific staff, and it has been an incredible honor and privilege.

state of the economy is good.  Nevertheless, as the policy discussion that this group will make wise carefully from the outside.  So thank you all. I know the current indicates, life is not going to be simple.  And Jay is going to have his share of challenges, as all of you will, in managing things.  But I have great confidence choices as you go forward, and I will be looking have heard considerable support during the go-round for alt-B as proposed.  But before I put that forward, let me say that that's sort of the Okay.  Back to policy.  I written, with the change

But I do want to consider the changes that have been if there is broader support for them. default for proposed to see the simpler one about the measures of inflation compensation to include it-and, I I do think it's indicative of a stronger it's not something that's necessary to do, and I guess I would like concerns and would feel more out?  Please let meSo I guess, starting with that Governor Brainard mentioned, I think my own preference would be suppose, not just for mechanical reasons, but also because outlook.  But I recognize that to see, are there other people who share Governor Brainard's comfortable leaving that language

we have slightly biased concerns on inflation.  But I don't have MR. KASHKARI.  I don't feel strongly.  I mean, I have a slight preference to leave it out, because I do think it signals a strong view.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Yes.

Yes, I mean, I think it's feeding into the 'hawkishness' of this little concerned that we're going to be overly 'hawky' here, with both the flagging rising inflation compensation.  So I can live with it either way, but to do something to tone this down just a little bit. MR. BULLARD. statement, and I am a 'further' in there and my preference would be

YELLEN.  Okay.  So let's discuss that larger issue, which also pertains to the CHAIR second suggestion, President Bullard-that you suggested removing 'further.'

in paragraph 4.  There are actually two is in paragraph 2.  In both places in which the language about adjustments or gradual increases in the federal funds rate is referred to, we added the And, as Governor Powell indicated, there is an intention here to be slightly So that's not an accident.  That is by design, in that the data have been a lot stronger. Now, you mentioned removing 'further' 'further's' here, one of which gradual term 'further.' 'hawkier.'

January 30-31, 2018

in stone, there's going to be a pretty strong increase the funds rate in March. I suppose, although nothing obviously is set inclination in the Committee to likely to signal further changes in the statement in rate path.  Rather than have things look as though was a discontinuous change-you know, 'I left, and you've got a new sheriff in town who 'hawkier' stance'-we're trying to provide some continuity.  So I think some shift here is appropriate.  But, nevertheless, I want to make sure that we do The minutes, if you have listened to the discussion around the table, are greater concern with upside risks, and perhaps there'll be March and perhaps an upward shift in the SEP there has a much slightly 'hawky' have this right, and that the Committee is comfortable with what you have here.

it from in both places, and it does seem to be the big upward shift in Treasury yields and concern in the market.  I mean, I we might be projecting too 'hawky' a stance.  But, you 'hawkier' statement, and that it does would Vice Chairman. I suppose one possibility would be to use 'further' in paragraph 2 and to omit paragraph 4.  I mean, there was a reason to include it case that we have seen a think we should think about whether know, I do think that it's appropriate to have a somewhat reflect the underlying reality of the forecast and likely path of monetary policy.  So I appreciate your comments as to whether you think we should just stick with what we have or make an adjustment.

DUDLEY.  I completely agree with how you stated it-that, I think, really important that the Committee be perceived as having a very smooth transition from meeting was, we would have a bland, and then the March meeting would arrive, potentially with four SEP median-we don't know, but potentially-and that could have been pretty big lurch in policy.  Then there would be press reports about how, 'Oh, the VICE CHAIRMAN it's one Chair to the other.  What I worried about going into this statement that was very rate hikes as our viewed as a

January 30-31, 2018

is very different from the Yellen Fed'-which I don't think is actually true in terms really important not to send a misleading message market as we go through the transition. Powell Fed of how we're going to evolve.  So I think it's to the think, pretty united.  I think we're arguing about, really, rate hikes as opposed to what direction we're sort of going in.  So I think it's really little bit 'hawkier.'  Let's say that the data come out weak over the next we dial it back in March, we'll be able to dial it back in the SEP, and, you You know, the Committee is, I timing of important that this be a six weeks.  Then know, no harm done.

it back in March, it seems the damage is much less than the other way around-that we're think that for the transition. So if you think about the risk-reward here, if we could make this a little hawky and then dial very, very, you know, not hawky now, and then there's a big change in March.  I would not be helpful

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Bullard.

make my case here.  I is already doing our work for us.  They're already perceiving the Committee as in the 'hawkish' direction.  There is a bond selloff going on already.  I'm just saying feed into that in this situation. MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Let me just try to think the market shifting you don't really need to is 'hawkier' today and then Jay comes on board and the the Committee is even 'hawkier,' kind of doubling up on, you know, the transition.  So it was another way to read this, this statement.  We don't have to do anything. adjustment for us.  So just leave it alone, and I don't think we Also, if you say the Committee perception is, because of nominations and other things, that then you're which is:  No one is expecting anything out of The markets is already doing the need to feed into that.

January 30-31, 2018

DUDLEY.  I don't think that's really accurate, Jim.  I think the make some adjustments to the statement.  I don't know ifVICE CHAIRMAN market is actually expecting us to Simon, do you want to address that?

They are expecting some changes.  The inflation comp is one of the ones measure from what we look at. MR. POTTER. that they've noticed.  They tend to look at a slightly different

MR. BULLARD.  But we would be doing that.  We just wouldn't be hinting that we're going to four.

The other thing that's happened in the past week after we did our survey the reports, they are looking at the balance of risks, and we see some would change.  That's consistent with the discussion you've had over two days of what's happened with the outlook and the global growth picture, and that's firming up.  So I wouldn't call it a bond selloff-I'd call it more of an adjustment to what MR. POTTER. is, if you read some of people thinking that that the past just might be a steeper rate path.

in this context, in terms of react to that? MR. POWELL.  Simon, how do you see the word 'further' what the market's thinking and how they'd

It's either the most obvious word you could add, or they can think it So I think there are some optionsMR. POTTER. actually means something.  And our experience in trying to predict how they're going to read things-we're, at best, 50 percent accurate.

you're saying it's either a big deal or it's not.  [Laughter] think it can really be that big a deal, because everyone going to do what you've already going to do is not a big deal.  Then they're going to say, 'Well, why did they bother MR. POWELL.  So MR. POTTER.  No, no.  I don't expects two to three rate increases already.  So, saying you're said you're

January 30-31, 2018

of this stuff.  'Well, the Fed doesn't like to change the saying that?'  And then you do all statement too much.  Maybe they're trying to hint.'

say, 'This is the Fed we don't really believe them.'  We have seen that.  When we put things 'hawky' in the statement, sometimes they don't have any effect whatsoever. So that's one version.  That could steepen things.  Or they could just trying to do things, but that we think are

YELLEN.  Governor Quarles, were you going toCHAIR

Yes, just to add, I think it's actually a very good balance, Both from view of communicating continuity and, as President Bostic had said, from the point risk management.  It will be easier and less confusing communication in the event that I mean, the press wants to write the story 'Change at the we give them the opportunity to write that story, they will do it.  I don't happening, and it would certainly be not what we want to communicate This statement, the way it's crafted, communicates the message that there will be a different that's opposed to the story they want to write.  We're pushing against that MR. QUARLES. the point of of view of this would be dialed back in March. Federal Reserve,' so if think that that is what's with this. continuity as we go forward.  And if it has to be dialed back, then that is communication, one story.  I think it's very wise.

Could I just ask a question? MS. BRAINARD.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Sure.

As our incoming Chairman thinks about this language becoming in future?  And is that than, for instance, going back to language that looks at the balance of risks, to the which would be a more traditional approach?  I'm MS. BRAINARD. evergreen, are you then contemplating that you'll just keep the 'further's' a better mechanism which would be the more customary way of doing it-to simply say 'near-term risks economic outlook appear tilted to the upside,'

January 30-31, 2018

meeting from now, you're going to think about the two 'furthers' relative just wondering how, a to that kind of language.

DUDLEY.  If I could just interject, I think one of the issues, of of language changes is, you've got to be careful how big the language changes if the market misinterprets it, it's hard to correct I am actually very sympathetic with the idea of talking about how the balance of at a non-press-conference meeting. VICE CHAIRMAN course, in terms are at a non-press-conference meeting, because that, right? risks has changed, but, boy, I'm not sure I'd want to do it

YELLEN.  It might be something you would want to do in March. CHAIR

So do you have in mind that the 'further' language is going toDUDLEY.  I mean, my view is, that's subtle enough. MS. BRAINARD. VICE CHAIRMAN MS. BRAINARD.  For today.

DUDLEY.  For today, yes. VICE CHAIRMAN

out when to drop it later?  That's the question I'm really MS. BRAINARD.  I'm thinking-so does 'further,' then, just remain, and we then have the awkwardness of trying to figure asking.

DUDLEY.  There is always this problem of the statement language. VICE CHAIRMAN CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kaplan.

a degree that I think even people in the markets, you probably hear, are MR. KAPLAN.  My own view is, in looking at the markets, they're running in a way that is concerning, to such concerned themselves.  I felt very strongly in our conversation.  I feel very strongly-it's not a close call for me.  I think we should keep in both 'furthers.'

market does pay attention, I think that actually may be a constructive thing.  My from it.  But I think if it did, it would be positive, and I If the fear is, the market won't take much

March is an eternity from now in market life.  I'd want wouldn't want to put it off until March. to put the stake in the ground here, and I think we'd be well served by doing that.  I feel that pretty strongly.

risk in doing it, but, on balance, I think preferable course.  So let me ask Jim Clouse to make clear what the FOMC will vote on CHAIR YELLEN.  Further comments?  [No response]  Okay.  Well, hearing this discussion, I think my inclination would be to vote on alt-B with the bracketed language included and to keep the 'furthers.'  I recognize that there is some it's the and read the roll.

vote will be on the monetary policy materials, with the included.  The vote will also encompass the directive to the Desk as it in the implementation note shown on pages 9 and 10 of Thomas's briefing materials. MR. CLOUSE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.
