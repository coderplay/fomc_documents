And, I'd also like vote to serve as Secretary of the FOMC for a term previous playing a key role duties obviously, Brian is no stranger to this room.

like to also welcome Michael Strine to his first FOMC meeting.

for Simon?  President Dudley. CHAIR YELLEN.  Other questions clarify.  On panel 17, the Treasury cash balance and that increases the supply of risk-free assets and reduces the overnight RRP.  If the debt limit becomes binding, then Treasury would draw down in time.  Is inference? VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I just want to increases its demand for its cash balance.  And so the demand for our overnight RRP could go up at that point that a reasonable

is definitely that direct effect.  And we know that, if this was lots of other changes in money markets.  There's another issue that really faced yet.  Treasury bills are viewed as very safe assets, and there's only one to raise the MR. POTTER.

Primary dealers For open market operations, the benefit of publication clearly outweighs the cost. The Desk relies on primary dealers for a variety support of its mandate, such as FR 2004 reporting, TMPG best practice adherence, and survey responses about policy expectations are willing to serve these needs because they value the status they obtain from being listed as a primary dealer.

The $150 million requirement that we currently have was put in in early 2010.  And I think it was, to be frank, a result of negotiation and experience with set of firms that we were dealing with.  We don't really view that necessarily as a mitigant for counterparties, it's really more a sign of the development of a firm and management, et cetera.

The robust owing in part to the drop in oil prices, as well as elevated wealth-to-income ratio displayed in panel 5.

One implication of the dissonance between recent data on aggregate demand and the more upbeat labor market data noted earlier is a decline in business-sector productivity, shown by the black line in panel 6.  After debating whether to nudge

it alone for now.  Accordingly, we assume that down our estimate of the trend, the green line, we perhaps let hope triumph over experience and decided to leave productivity growth will step up over the medium term.  This is one factor behind the projected slowing in the pace of job growth and the flatter trajectory for the unemployment rate over the medium term.

Outside forecasters generally project unemployment rate over the medium term.  For example, the Blue Chip consensus forecast puts the unemployment rate at 4¾ percent by the end of 2016, and the Survey of Professional Forecasters has a similar outlook.  Their lower unemployment rates than those in the staff projection are consistent with their stronger outlooks for real GDP growth.

A key question going forward, and one at the heart of the secular stagnation debate, permanent downshift in rates or whether, as growth firms, interest rates will rise closer to pre-crises

the AFEs, I examine one international section of Tealbook, Book A.  The first approach focuses on which is assumed to be constant over time.  It uses an estimated dynamic DSGE, model consisting of a Phillips curve IS equation, and a Taylor rule. Turning to exhibit 8, to look at this question for important determinant of the level of interest rates:  the equilibrium interest rate, or the short-term real interest rate consistent with output at potential and stable inflation. Here, I present estimates of the equilibrium rate in the AFE economies using two approaches, outlined in panel 1 and discussed in more detail in a box by Andrea Raffo in the identifying cyclical movements of the short-run equilibrium rate around its steadystate value, stochastic general equilibrium, or equation, an

According to the model, the AFE equilibrium real interest in negative territory, about 3½ percentage points nearly 2 percent.  Moreover, the effects of the recession are very persistent:  Absent additional shocks, the AFE aggregate equilibrium interest rate by 2020 is projected to still be more than ½ percentage point below steady state.  Thus, viewed within this framework, the current long-run slow adjustment of rates to the steady state.

Their machinery generates this long-run equilibrium rate in the United States, shown by the over the past decade. Other evidence, however, including that based on the framework in Laubach and Williams (2003), suggests that the the United States may drift over time.  Their approach starts from an empirical framework that includes estimating the link between slow-moving changes in the equilibrium interest rate and in trend growth of output.  Should you have any questions on this approach, you should feel free to bring result that, indeed, the black line in panel 3, has declined significantly the average more difficult to face future recessions using only Applying a similar methodology to data for the AFEs, we find that AFE equilibrium rate (the red line) has also fallen steadily and is currently negative. This result suggests that AFE policy rates may remain much lower than in the early 2000s for structural, rather than cyclical, reasons.  Should this be the case, AFE policymakers may find it conventional tools.

about inferring that the equilibrium interest rate other factors, particularly relevant to open However, one should be cautious is permanently lower.  These estimates are very imprecise, and the underlying determinants of the equilibrium rate can change over time.  Some factors that have been cited as likely pushing down the equilibrium rate, such as declining working-age population, seem hard to change, but economies, may give cause for hope.

in the mid-2000s, countries with large current account surpluses (the red account deficits.  For the period ahead, we anticipate the negative pressure on rates stemming from these flows will ease from its peak, economies For example, some of the decline in equilibrium rates has been attributed to the global savings glut-the phenomenon that, before the global financial crisis, especially bars in panel 4) were exporting their savings to advanced economies, particularly the United States, which ran current that as the current account surpluses of the oil exporters narrow and the Asian rebalance some toward domestic demand.

Three points emerge from this exercise. the median Taylor-rule-implied policy rates for 2016 have been persistently federal funds rate more than the median of the Taylor-rule-implied rates.  This that the variables that appear on the right-hand side of the rule formula, and the real federal funds encompass the factors that influence your forecasts-or at least they do the most recent three projections, the gap between Building on some analysis that was presented to you at the at your policy prescriptions through the lens of a noninertial briefing in March, I use your individual SEP side variables in the Taylor rule longer-run normal level of the unemployment rate and the funds rate.  The median of those 17 estimates at solid red line back in the panel at the First, higher-averaging around 1½ percentage points higher- than the median of the rates you viewed as appropriate.

This pattern highlights the fact that much of the time variation federal funds rate forecasts stems not from changes in the projected variables on the right-hand side of the rule equation-unemployment and The bottom participants' federal the individual residual values shown by the green open circles.  There are some noteworthy outliers among these residuals, but well clustered.  The two lines in the panel are medians, analogous to the lines of these residuals, while the black dashed line shows deviations of the median federal funds rate projections from the median Taylor-rule-implied rate by forecast.  Note the close correlation of these two lines-the black dashed line, especially-with the blue line in your that appear inflation-but rather from other, unspecified factors.

We can infer that whatever they represent your practicing 'risk management' in the face of the effective and other asymmetric risks in the current economic that they represent your perception of a temporary, if the target federal funds rate below levels the That concludes my remarks. How to interpret explains them has been persistent and is expected to continue.  One interpretation is that lower bound problem environment; another is persistent, decline in the equilibrium real interest rate.  Either interpretation could serve as justification for 'keeping Committee views as normal in the longer run.'

Chairman. CHAIR YELLEN.  Additional questions?  Vice

DUDLEY.  I have a question about the staff's view on productivity it to return to its trend rate.  What's the staff's underlying story about what we're Is it mismeasured GDP?  Is it less capital deepening?  Is it that we just don't understand there competing theories about why we're seeing such lousy productivity numbers?  And how we should think about the outlook?  Which weight do you put on VICE CHAIRMAN growth.  We've had these very bad draws on productivity growth, and you've talked about how you expect seeing? it?  Are how does that influence that?

Just as a little background to that, over the forecast period-2015 to What we don't have is it going back to the experience that MR. FOLLETTE. 2017-we've got productivity growth, in terms of the trend, of around 1.6 percent, which is similar to the pre-1995 experience. we had from 1995 to 2007.

a decent step-up from that.  A portion capital deepening in the forecast period than we had it probably reflects the idea that some of the scarring of the economy Over the course of this recovery so far-as you know-from around 2010 to 2014, we've had around 1 percent productivity growth.  So there will be of that step-up is because there's more before that, and a portion of

June 16-17, 2015

But most of the forecast step-up reflects the fact that that to a strong view among people that there is mismeasurement of from the financial crisis fades over time. we don't really understand the slowdown from 2010 to 2014, and we expect some of unwind.  I think there is productivity growth and that some of that has gotten a little bit larger over time as it has become more difficult to measure some of the effects of technological advances on product quality.

But, are we, all of a sudden, then going to measure it That's what you're implying.  I guess I'm focused more on just the last year.  We've had the last four quarters, andVICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. better? really poor productivity growth over not that much worse than the priorMR. FOLLETTE.  It's

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

It's 0.3 percent.

FOLLETTE. We've had a bad five years. MR.

And the reason why I think it's so germane is because relevant to the forecast in terms of how growth translates to labor market seems to me you have to have a view on what productivity growth is seeing right now.  Is that unfair?  I mean, I a good theory either. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. it's really improvement.  And so it going to do to understand how growth is going to translate into employment.  It doesn't sound like we really have a good theory of what we are don't have

WILCOX. We have a view that performance is not likely to recuperate by going to its pre-crisis trend rate of increase.  We think it's not going to remain as bad as it's been. since We've attributed quite a bit of that to multifactor productivity growth.  Some of it has MR. back All of the surprises on trend productivity growth have been to the south of our expectations the crisis. been due to a lack of capital deepening.

But I think it's worth reminding ourselves that we still haven't based on DSGE models, the models that the Board uses, the models that we use a waning of headwinds yet, based on this method, at So, even though these models tells you we are going to go back to normal by assumption, it is r * back to a normal level. a combination of supply and demand shocks-they are as strong today as they were three years ago in the U.S. models.  And this gets me back to Laubach-Williams in panel that model-and apparently in your analysis using the AFE version of the model-there is absolutely no sign, even through 2015:Q1, of any waning of these headwinds.  I know it's not popular lawyer here seen-at least elsewhere-we haven't seen any sign of least.

WILCOX.  Hear, hear. MR.

MR. WILLIAMS.  Well, that's the debate, right?

WILCOX.  Yes. MR.

WILLIAMS. The one side is that the headwinds will abate, they'll wane, and we'll or whatever.  And the other is that, for reasons that we don't fully MR. move back to 2 percent understand, a number like negative 0.3, like you mentioned, may be around for the next 5 to 10

That's all I'm saying.  I'm talking about flat priors.  But I just wanted to make the point we're seeing it come back.  And that's-what did you say?  That's 'hope ahead of experience.' [Laughter]

approach is that you can linked to potential output growth and linked to a residual.  And what we've seen when we've done that is that the suggest, I think, greater odds that will be reversed.  There are reasons to think potential output growth could recover, residual could also encompass a number of factors-headwinds, a global savings glut, we think may go away. MS. WILSON.  One thing I would note is, one aspect of your decompose the equilibrium rate into the component that's the component that's part that's linked to a residual accounts for a large part of the decline.  That is, the decline is not explained by the behavior of potential growth, and that does the decline but the changes in preferences, risk aversion, and deleveraging-that lot right after the global in 2008 and 2009.  It then goes back down again, probably reflecting the euro crisis and its effects on our AFE aggregate combined, a little bit later, effect of the consumption tax increase on Japan.  So both the euro area and Japan have these secondary reverberations that do, to some extent, reflect the initial crisis but MR. KAMIN.  It might be also worth noting-returning to panel 2, looking at the cyclical version-that the calculation for AFEs actually bounces back a financial crisis reaches its height largely with the experienced could be thought of as additional shocks that maybe the U.S. economy was not subject to.

the very weak reading on first-quarter real GDP growth as mostly anomalous, with about the underlying pace of growth for the rest of this year or next year. Tealbook did a very nice job on this-that a were at work, although the precise quantification and when offset in later quarters is still open to quite some debate. I view essentially no signal It's clear-and I think the Board analysis and the variety of transitory special factors they will be my staff has examined this issue and found that imperfect measurement of a large role in depressing reported Q1 numbers.  Most of this residual appears to be caused by the BEA's bottom-up methodology that seasonally adjusts Like others, seasonal patterns played seasonality

BEA uses are logically consistent at every sense for their purposes, but for monetary policy the most accurate top-line measure of the broad economy. best to focus on eliminating seasonality in the aggregate GDP series and not worry so the individual subcomponents of GDP but not the aggregate number directly.  And the this procedure to create the national income accounts.

own secondFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's GDPplus measure, which is a smoothed have grown about Based on these even lower, I am hardto describe the first-quarter growth really as weak or lackluster or disappointing. To provide such a top-line correction to the data, my staff conducted their round seasonal adjustment of the published data on three measures of aggregate growth:  GDP; GDI; and the combination of GDP and GDI.  After this correction, GDP is estimated to 1½ percent in Q1, GDI about 3 percent, and GDPplus about 2¾ percent. corrected numbers and relative to a trend growth rate of 2 percent or pressed later this year. in stronger Q2 growth, most of the overstatement of growth into the third quarter.  What does It means we shouldn't be looking for a Q2 spike in growth.  Instead, most of the effect will likely show up in an elevated Q3 growth rate.  Now, looking at the more since Q1, recent spending indicators have generally been moving in the right pointing to, I think, a solid trajectory for growth and good momentum. In addition, the second round of seasonal adjustment informs about when the residual seasonality that acts to understate Q1 will be balanced by overstated growth While the Tealbook assumes the unwinding of special factors will result my staff's estimates push that mean? seasonal recent data direction and are

So I have the data here, and the Warriors and the Warriors have actually played in three previous collected the data on what Warriors championship.  By the way, Blake, two Warriors Cavaliers championship, but, of course, there is a lack of data.

The championships and won three previous championships, and I've happens to GDP growth in the year following a of those were in Philadelphia.  Average real GDP growth in the year following a championship is 3.9 percent.  Now, I did look into the database to see what would happen following a think we all agree-for the good of the economy and to reduce the uncertainty regarding victory-we should all be supporting the Warriors tonight of the series.

This in income seems to have buoyed the spirits of households as well, and we saw the pickup or in expected income growth reported recently in the Michigan survey. All in all, with solid underlying momentum in fundamentals, I expect growth to average about 2¾ percent over the next several quarters or perhaps even higher, sustainable pace.  I see household wealth and solid income gains owing to rising employment and higher wages.  In that regard, I am ECI up about 2¾ percent over the past year.  And employer costs for employee compensation are up about 5½ percent over the rise the rise risks to this outlook as broadly balanced.  Many have mentioned the unsettling I view the crosscurrents coming from abroad.  We heard about the situation in Greece, but obviously I hear

about Asia and China.  With regard to Asia, I was largely reassured during my recent that emerging market economies are acutely a 'tightening tantrum,' in which there is fallout from spikes in market well telegraphed.  In addition, the taper tantrum of 2013 has served as a warning to leaders region, and they appear to be prepared to cope with any resulting effects on capital flows. a lot also trip to Singapore, then Hong Kong, then Beijing, where I was joined by Governor Powell.  Our discussions with Asian policymakers suggested focused on a U.S. monetary policy liftoff.  Rest assured everyone asked about that.  And there was some concern about volatility and capital flows.  But the general assessment was that U.S. policy normalization has been in the it takes to ensure to 7.0 percent fostered consideration of additional stimulatory policy to local government borrowing when it became concerned that this would damp We also found policymakers in China ready and willing to do whatever strong growth in that country.

In contrast, the broadest U-6 measure of labor underutilization, With regard to the U.S. labor market, I expect the unemployment rate to fall below my 5.2 percent unemployment is aligned with other U-5 measures of labor job but available and interested in work.

Indeed, these more persistent currently elevated number of involuntary part-timers beyond what one would expect on the basis of the 5½ percent unemployment rate.  Based on these findings, I conclude that slack unemployment.

To put that in we saw exceptionally strong growth in the second half of 2014, and as of April, the average growth rate for this The outlook for consumer spending is pivotal, in positive.  Sure, we've had some personal context, consumption was up 2.7 percent year over year, well above expansion.

Moreover, even was marked down for the remainder of this year, it quarter and the second half, which is quite strong compared with earlier in this expansion, when consumption was averaging 2¼ percent.

in consumer spending growth no doubt has something to do with past past year has averaged 255,000 per averaged This sustained increase improved balance sheets, but my sense is that the improvement in labor markets over the year has been very important as well.

Chair.  I'm going to spend my time today have rightly expressed the desire to guard the risk of model misspecification in formulating inflation forecasts.  So to mitigate this MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam on the inflation outlook.  Many around this table against risk, my staff and I went through a suite of inflation forecasting models in preparation for this meeting.

the balance of risk to inflation remains very much to will remain 2 percent through its forecast horizon, which ends in 2017.  All three models predict that inflation will remain below 2 percent through My summary of this survey is that the downside.  More specifically, the outlook in Tealbook, Book A, is that inflation below 2 percent until 2019.  The Survey of Professional Forecasters' median outlook is that inflation will remain below Federal Reserve System DSGE their forecast horizons.

Reserve Bank, we have a purely statistical model that we use for onto it credibility of our target or a Phillips curve relationship.  However, the model At the Minneapolis forecasting purposes-by 'purely statistical,' what I mean is, we don't layer presumptions of the

It simply is not able to for the past 30 years or enough evidence is allowed to detect those things in the last 30 years of data if it's able to find them. model's modal projection is that inflation will never return find enough of the Phillips curve relationship in the data of the credibility of our inflation target to warrant getting back to 2 percent inflation.

the basis for details there, but, again, market-based outlooks tell a medium term. So I count that as six different model- and judgment-based inflation forecasts.  Now, I continue to favor market-based-as opposed to model-based-inflation outlooks as policy.  I won't drag you through the similar low-inflation story over the to the forecast that Robert went through from the Summary in the Committee have inflation lead you to forecast a more rapid return of inflation to target.  If you're able to to share those sources of information and modeling with my staff.  We'd about here in Minneapolis, we would be very interested in understanding what leads others to see were able to find right now. Now, this stands in contrast of Economic Projections.  Nearly two-thirds of the forecasts back to 2 percent or more at the end of 2017.  Some of you probably have access to models or information that do so, it would be great be very interested in understanding how people were getting to different conclusions where we stand on inflation.  Some of you might be seeing the Phillips curve as having more slope than we do.  You might see the natural rate as being higher than we do-or Board staff do, for that matter.  It would be interesting to understand why.  It would be useful to share that.  At least more inflationary pressures than we

there are standard errors associated with these point and I agree with that.  These associated standard errors are quite large.  In light of right way to read them is as a simple summary statistic of the the medium term.  That builds in a symmetry assumption of Now, it's often emphasized that forecasts, those standard errors, I think the balance of risks for inflation over

If I tell you a point basically see what the likelihood is of inflation being above 2 percent or below.  The low point forecasts term is under 50 percent, arguably considerably so, but that depends on a and digging deeper all about the medium term.  I think these medium-term forecasts do not the full picture of the relevant inflation risks.  I see little risk of inflation being stuck at, over the next 10 years.  The Committee has the tools and the will to forestall this Now, this is provide say, 2½ percent outcome.

I see considerable risk that the Committee's actions could lead inflation to be is consistent with some of the the CPI forecast that we see in the Survey of Forecasters.  Certainly they're not forecasting 1½ percent PCE inflation over the a distribution of possible outcomes.  I just don't plausible that we're going to see 2½ percent over the next 10 years, but I think it is the next 10 years.  I don't sense a will or a desire to tools needed to forestall that latter outcome.  After all, if you look back, the FOMC's PCE core inflation to run below 2 percent in every month since late months in late 2011 and early 2012.  Over the past two years, troubling inflation forecast that I've just described. In contrast, stuck at, say, 1½ percent over the next 10 years.  I think this discussion that President Evans offered about Professional next 10 years, I'm not saying that, but there's think it's plausible that we could see 1½ percent over use the choices have led annual 2008, with the exception of a few the Committee has continued on a course of removing accommodation.  Go back to, say, May 2013.  I think we basically have been on a path of removing accommodation pretty much in the teeth of the

Even though we've seen very sharp reversals of nominal bond yields, the inflation breakevens remain low.

true inflation target of, say, 1½ percent even if we had a stated inflation percent?  I think there's a couple of answers one could give.  One is that, as a publicly should match up with let's leave that aside.  Let's talk just about economics. So what?  There's nothing hugely scientific about an inflation target of 2 percent, right? Couldn't we have a target of 2 accountable institution, presumably the outcomes we're trying to achieve our stated goals, but lower inflation target will lead to worse real outcomes.  If inflation 2 percent, then nominal yields would be 50 basis points means it will take a smaller shock to the natural real interest rate to hit the size of the that we're currently maintaining.  So our stays at the zero lower bound will lead to are why we should care-I think that's easy for us all to see.  If mandate in a more systematic fashion over the next decade, we credibility of our inflation target.  I'll have more to say to best do so tomorrow, Madam Chair.  Thank you. The problem is that a breakevens are 1½ percent rather than lower on average.  That the zero lower bound.  Our tools in those circumstances are costly, especially with balance sheet employment shortfalls, and those we want to meet our employment should be doing more to buttress the about how

But all that said, it is disappointing, especially the retail sales sales for March, so maybe On the growth side, I think I share been somewhat disappointing, with growth in the bit over 1 percentage point.  Now, some of this can be attributed to special factors:  the unseasonably cold, snowy winter; residual seasonal adjustment problems; transitory factors such as the sharp weaker-than-expected trajectory of consumer spending.  However, last Thursday's report for May was strong and there was a sizable upward revision in some of the shortfall in consumer spending relative to expectations is already resolving itself.

So what does this but I still think we're on rate path 2015-one in September and one in December-and I'll have

the sharp backup we've seen in bond yields recently? potentially later liftoff of U.S. monetary policy.  Even with the rise to a 10-year Treasury yields are not particularly high, especially if you going to start a journey back to 3½ percent or so for the nominal federal funds rate Remember, after the taper tantrum we were at about 3 percent.  The current yield Treasury note yield in five years' time of only about 3 percent.  So even 10-year rates going forward. Finally, how should we think about My own view is that it's warranted, and better now than later.  The yields have been pulled down mainly by European QE, which had depressed bond term premiums, and soft Q1 activity measures that implied a little bit below 2.4 percent, think we're later this year. curve implies a 10-year with this backup, we're not really discounting a big rise in occur in steps and away from the date of liftoff rather than following liftoff.  So with the backup in the yields now, we have a yield normal.  Considerable tightening is already discounted in its think that reduces the chance that we'll see a really sharp rise in yields when we point.  Thank you, Madam Chair. To me, it's better to have this one big jump around or curve that is quite a bit steeper than shape, so I actually do lift off.  At least that's my hope at this

I-and I believe most of us around the underlying performance of the economy might be slowing had in the first quarter of 2014.  We were concerned in particular about that the underlying, strongly positive thrust of economic activityin the labor market, in which monthly increases in employment had averaged more supported by the March increase in MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  In April, this table-were concerned that more persistently than it slowing job gains, declining industrial output, and weakness in several spending categories. Most seriously, I was worried especially than 260,000 in 2014-could be slowing.  And that fear was employment of only about 120,000.

the labor market has, for some time, been much stronger than of output and employment has been puzzling since the start in March 2015, hiring remained strong.  The staff generally takes the view accurate than the output data, which is to say that we should be putting more weight implied by the GDP data if there is some data, which is entirely possible. It is worth emphasizing that the GDP data.  Since early last year, the unemployment rate has declined more than 1 percentage point.  The difference in the behavior of the recovery, and it was particularly stark in the first quarters of 2014 and 2015, when GDP declined and, except that when the employment and GDP data appear inconsistent, the employment data are more likely to be on the behavior of the employment data than on that error in the meeting have reinforced the view that the weakness mostly transitory and should reassure us that the underlying the recent data. at an annual rate of 3½ percent so far this year, and auto sales the first quarter were also strong.  Housing The data coming in since our April we saw in the first quarter was likely strength of the labor market continues despite the March weakness.  Consider Real core retail sales have risen have been extremely strong.  Services data for investment growth has stepped up considerably since the second half of last year.  Specifically,

in the first half of this today's data, which is up from a 3.5 percent gain in the second 12-month index has moved appreciably higher, which is in turn consistent rise this year, the participation rate has leveled out, the share of workers working time for economic reasons has diminished further, and job openings have jumped. residential investment is estimated to be rising at a 9 percent annual pace year, and that takes into account half of last year.  And we are finally beginning to see a pickup in compensation.  The change in the employment cost with the ongoing improvements in the labor market.  The employment-to-population ratio has continued to part evidence reinforces these data.  In the Beige Book, most Districts reported and John Stevens, the number of respondents expecting to increase coming 12 months was as strong as it was in December and higher than it inquiries. Anecdotal improvements in the housing sector, with some describing the market as 'very active' or 'strong.'

The price of oil now seems to be in a new range, as likely to move up as to move down.  And the Board staff forecast that core early next year, which will help support core inflation going starts to wane, the core inflation rate moving up.  And for the same reason-the relative increase of import prices-we are total inflation rising as well.  This might not start to happen by September or even it will happen before long, by which I mean within a year.  And those will relevant to any changes in monetary policy we put in place in the next few As for inflation, I remain reasonably confident that we will see inflation beginning move back toward our 2 percent target before too long.  Core 1.2 percent, a figure that by the recent declines in from which it is import prices will resume increasing forward.  As the influence of declining oil, energy, gas prices, and import prices we will begin to see stabilization of oil prices and the stabilization and possible likely to see this year, but I believe be the inflation rates months.

inflation expectations have remained pretty steady, despite the very not the inflation numbers today that persuade inflation rising over our projection horizon; rather, it's my conviction that the Phillips curve will itself as the incoming evidence is beginning to suggest.  I also put weight on the fact that will converge to 2 percent-a I'm reassured that low levels of headline inflation.  But, overall, it's me that we'll see economic slack has been diminishing and continues to diminish, and that reassert the SEP results show unanimity on the point that inflation

As several of you have noted, the slack, which many people saw as not reflected in the unemployment rate over the last few years, did turn out to be

June 16-17, 2015

seems to be contracting somewhat.  I take the fact that the labor participation rate has would during this period labor participation should have been declining, and, thus, the market.  The question of much additional slack remains, I still think, is a salient one, and not as easy to answer as the might suggest.  So I'm slightly more cautious but join in the general might have thought we would be in just a few weeks ago. too, now been flat for the last 18 months as actually very good news, because demographics suggest that flatness suggests that people are in fact being pulled back into the labor how unemployment rate itself view that we are in a much better position today than we finding ourselves

them.  First, President Williams has already alluded by Rob Valletta and Catherine van der List of the Federal Reserve Bank of San time for economic reasons may be due to structural factors, such as the ratio of PTER to unemployed persons has been since 2002, they suggest that some of these factors may be persistent, in which case the ratio may not return all the way to its pre-crisis level. In recent work by economists throughout the System, there have been three suggestions along these lines, and I will briefly mention to the paper Francisco, who use a cross-state study to find that some portion of the unusually elevated number of workers who are part industry and age composition.  Noting that rising part-time-for-economic-reasons and David Ratner of the Board staff have looked behind the the labor share of labor share, then the return to posting vacancies industries and states in which the labor share has fallen more have seen higher increases even if the long-awaited shift of the implication would be that the natural Second, Andrew Figura outward shift in the Beveridge curve and argue that the secular decline in income from roughly 70 percent to 63 percent since 2000 has been driven by forces that have also increased the incentives for firms to post more jobs.  So, for example, if diminished worker bargaining power is behind the decline in the will be higher for employers.  Andrew and David find empirical support for their argument in the fact that in job postings.  The implication of this research is that Beveridge curve back to its pre-crisis position does not occur, the permanent rightwards movement may not itself reflect an increase in structural unemployment.  And if the curve were eventually to shift back toward its pre-crisis position, the

lower than some expect.  On the other hand, if the labor share of income were to the curve stays shifted to the right, that would imply a higher natural likelihood on that rate is even reverse its decline while rate, although I should note that Andrew and David place a substantially lesser third outcome than the first two.

that a material effect on the latter.  This is the latest in a line of research the last couple of years, suggesting the past few decades have seen a break in the previous relationship between labor costs and measures.  The authors cast doubt on explanations such as downward nominal wage seen over the past couple of years. The third paper is one by Ekaterina Peneva and Jeremy Rudd of the Board staff that models the relationship of labor cost to price inflation in recent years, finding little evidence a change in the former has that many of us have referred to during these meetings over that broad price rigidity for explaining the phenomena that we've three interesting pieces of research leaves some focuses on a pretty short and, in macroeconomic identified by the authors as composition, tend themselves to move with the business it may be a little bit difficult to disentangle what is structural from what is cyclical.

And, of course, as a key explanatory most important dynamics that are The Figura-Ratner work does not directly measure the loss of bargaining power, but instead shows the relationship the Peneva-Rudd paper itself notes that its undermining of labor costs factor driving inflation leaves unanswered the question of the determining price inflation today.

And I mention them today not simply to advertise the interesting work being done around the System, although that's probably a worthwhile thing to do, but also because we're going to have to make over paper, adding itself to that line of research to which I alluded earlier, does for into sharp relief the question of when one can be reasonably confident that inflation will return the 2 percent target.

Thank you, Madam Chair.  I will begin, as others have, with the questions really as bad as it seemed?  And, second, how I would agree with many voices around the table tentatively offer encouraging answers on both questions.

in the first quarter, which I found and thoughtful, suggests that underlying growth was in the range of 1 percent in the The discussion in Tealbook, Book A, on special factors very useful first quarter.  Some other outside estimates see an even greater one-time effect and, thus, stronger underlying growth.  So I'm inclined to believe that there was no sharp break in the pace of underlying growth in Q1, especially with real GDI growing at 1.4 percent and monthly payroll gains of nearly 200,000.

The As for the second quarter and the rest April meeting, particularly in those April and May employment reports showed job gains May retail sales estimate also struck a significantly more positive note, with solid growth for

also found the staff memo that Glenn Follette striking a generally positive note on labor market conditions as Housing starts have also strengthened, and although I don't expect a lot out of this sector welcome. The Michigan survey also provided more support for that positive spending narrative, with a significant uptick in confidence and the highest ratings for personal financial prospects and wage expectations since before the crisis.  I had taken part in writing to be well. in terms of being a major engine of growth, a small positive contribution is growth rate for believe that there is a significant chance that unemployment in the baseline forecast, given the payroll and productivity the course of the last couple of years, possible reasons-that I've spent many happy guess I'll just go for now with what's been happening for By putting a little more weight on the recent trend, I've got and dipping below 5 percent tomorrow.  These changes do happen to bring my forecast into closer Turning to my SEP submission, I have marked down a slightly stronger real GDP this year than is shown in the Tealbook and about the same as the Tealbook thereafter. On the unemployment front, I also will drop faster and further than forecasts.  Compared with the relationship we've seen over the Tealbook forecast calls for unemployment to drop significantly more slowly for a given amount of payroll growth for reasons-perfectly hours discussing with the staff, but I the last couple of years. unemployment declining to around 5 percent by the end of this year in 2016 and 2017.  With the economy slightly tighter, I've got inflation getting to 2 percent by 2017.  More on that alignment with the run of public forecasts I've seen, as I think was implicit in Glenn's earlier presentation.

And I would echo Governor Vice Chairman Dudley's comments, at least that I don't take any negative signal There's also been much income markets recently, but this seems to strong initial reaction to Tarullo's and for our normalization process-those are my words-from what happened in Europe during the intermeeting period.

Services Survey and the May and housing permits data, it now looks as though real GDP will advance at a rate over the first half of the year.  The most likely explanation component of this weakness is that the negative effects of the recent rise in the reduction in oil prices on net exports and business investment have been from growth over the first Even after incorporating the positive first-quarter Quarterly retail sales disappointing 1¼ percent annual for the persistent exchange rate and the larger than expected, likely subtracting around 1½ percentage points half of the year, while the positive effects, which should be reflected primarily in consumer spending, have not materialized as projected.

the variety of factors that would normally be supportive.  Real interest rates remain quite low by historical wealth and equity wealth have each increased at double-digit rates on 3½ percent over the past year.  And households appear to understand consumer sentiment is at relatively elevated levels. The lackluster pace of household spending is surprising, in view of present standards.  Housing average over the past two years.  Robust job gains and falling energy prices have contributed to increases in real incomes of these favorable conditions, as

Spending on new homes has also been disappointing, and starts consistent with population growth, although the May data on single-family permits spot.

at least possible that household behavior continues to be shaped by the experience of financial crisis and the Great Recession, with an increased perception of tail risks and among many consumers that increases in income and wealth may be highly contingent are reluctant to spend out of any gains, the It's the concerns and subject to reversal.

That projection is based on a relatively the risk of a messy Greek exit from the euro increased of late, as has the risk of persistent weakness in aggregate demand abroad. creditors and the Greek government are at a At the same time, Developments abroad are another source of potential ongoing headwinds.  Slow growth in aggregate demand abroad and its effects on the exchange rate of the dollar continue to weigh on goods production in the United States.

our labor market continues to improve.  May's employment report offers a averaged close to 220,000 in 2015, many have noted, still at a very respectable pace.  The one-tenth of a percentage point per month over is very welcome. Despite this, welcome reassurance on this front.  Employment gains have down from the pace of 2014, but as unemployment rate, which had fallen at close to 2013 and 2014, has declined only one-tenth percentage point over the past five months, but it appears that resource slack continues to diminish, now concentrated in other margins such as the participation rate, which employment cost index hourly earnings have moved up recently, and other indicators also point upward. to see sustained momentum to be this represents a broad-based, convincing step-up in wage growth.  The change in is not yet meaningfully different from the 2 percent average pace of the years, and the staff's current estimate of the four-quarter change in the other main Although aggregate measures of wage growth remain relatively low, on balance, here too we're seeing signs of acceleration.

However, many of On the inflation front, incoming data came in pretty close to staff expectations.  Very few of you noted any significant change over the rose only 1.2 percent.  These were

A number of you noted that the import prices, and our staff estimates inflation this likely behavior of core inflation in the period ahead, the staff estimate that assessment.  So when we turn to the critical you reasonably confident or increased your level of inflation will actually move up to 2 percent over the next couple of the dollar and oil prices have stabilized does raise inflation will move up toward core.  An important question, inflation still running below 2 percent, is, what will happen to that core rate as long as the labor market continues to improve, you inflation expectations, will tend to move up toward 2 percent over time, although we have to be sure that that outcome.  But several of you expressed deeper concerns that's a reasonable prediction.  President Evans emphasized the fact that Forecasters that CPI inflation expectations drifted down.

Would anybody like to comment or correct anything, if I garbled what you have my own, and they'll be directed toward learned since our previous meeting.  Back in April, this softness was largely transitory, but we couldn't be sure it wasn't the GDP now apparently activity. Okay, then let me add a couple of comments of what we have learned and what we haven't we faced a wide range of surprisingly weak readings on the labor market and real activity more broadly.  We thought beginning of a more serious stalling of the expansion.  And now, it seems to me, that with payroll gains running close to 210,000 in the past three months and real expanding at least at a moderate pace, that we were experiencing a temporary pause in

Tealbook estimates that real GDP is going to expand at only a pretty paltry annual rate in the first half of the year, even with a decent rebound in activity in the So whether real GDP over the rest of the year will be strong enough to sustain further market, even with the funds rate near zero.  We can't expect any dollar.  Indeed, the potential for things to worsen on this front is, in my view, government spending, in light of the federal, state, and local levels.  Residential investment isn't likely to be a That said, the 1¼ percent current quarter.  And the tone of some key monthly indicators has remained persistently soft. it's unclear improvement in the labor support from net exports this year, in view of the weak state of the global economy and elevated level of the material.  For example, a disorderly resolution of the Greek situation could put further upward pressure on the dollar.  We can't expect much support from fiscal realities at

long as credit availability remains so tight, that housing construction will contribute significant source of strength either, even with the recent uptick in permits and starts.  In part, this is simply because housing is such a small share of GDP.  But beyond that, I think it's unlikely, as a lot to real GDP growth anytime soon.

And, as I very large boost to real income from lower energy prices.  It both to Tealbook projects real PCE growth to pick up to of this year.  It also projects that the saving rate will decline sideways through the end of the percent or so for the year as a whole. I mentioned that business expected so far.  I know a lot of it especially now that oil prices have flattened out.  But the softness extends beyond this category. Maybe it is expected-and I think it reluctant aggregate demand, both at home and abroad.  But, at any rate, business surveys do point to only moderate investment growth, at best, in coming months, and that While household spending now looks to have expanded at a year, growth, nonetheless, has slowed noticeably since mentioned, that occurred despite the raises the possibility that we may have overestimated the stimulus from this windfall, date and over the rest of the year.  The 3½ percent in the second half appreciably.  But if the saving rate were to instead move just year, then real GDP would likely increase only 1

Of course, even mediocre GDP growth would not necessarily be inconsistent with further improvement in labor market conditions if the pace of productivity gains remains very low.  If that were to occur, we could see employment continuing to rise steadily and the unemployment rate falling to 5 percent relatively soon.  Depending on the accompanying inflation data, such an

But a development of that type would also imply that the rate is lower than we now estimate, suggesting both the need in the longer run and also a greater risk of returning to the zero lower outcome would likely warrant increasing the federal funds rate even though overall economic activity was economy's equilibrium real interest to tighten policy less bound-in short, a more gradual trajectory for interest rates.

have come in more or less as expected, and I convincingly demonstrate that the current very low readings on inflation are factors-namely, oil prices and the dollar.  So I feel On the inflation front, incoming information has similarly clarified some issues and left others unresolved.  On the positive side, the data think they substantially the result of transitory reasonably confident that by early next year, PCE inflation on a 12-month basis will be back to the neighborhood of 1½ percent, assuming that energy prices and the dollar do remain roughly stable.

that GDP the return to full employment even as rise.  I suppose I'm in the camp that's prepared to believe in the Phillips curve, but labor market will improve.  And without that would worry that resource utilization might not prove to be persistently tight enough over the medium term, even if inflation expectations remain On the other hand, I'm uncertain whether inflation will continue climbing after that point and reach our inflation objective within two to three years.  For me to be reasonably confident on this score, I'd have to see both further improvement in the labor market and evidence growth is likely to stay sufficiently strong to complete interest rates it's going to take, in my mind, confidence the assurance, I to bring inflation back to 2 percent well anchored.

To anticipate our policy discussion, I think we need more information before we can confidently say that conditions warrant raising the federal funds rate.  It's unrealistic to expect

September meeting, but at that point we will have received tightening, and that's a that all doubts will be erased by our six labor reports since we first stated the conditions necessary to initiate solid basis for assessing whether labor market conditions have improved sufficiently to initiate tightening.

in a better position to judge the likelihood that growth will stay As the year progresses, we'll also get additional readings on real activity and productivity, and I think we'll be strong enough to keep the economy moving back to full employment, and, thus, for us to be reasonably confident that inflation will gradually move back to 2 percent.

morning we So let me stop here.  What I'd like to do is to turn things over to Thomas, who's going to give us his briefing on our policy decision.  We'll then go to dinner, and tomorrow can begin right in on our policy round.

At the April meeting, conditions had progressed to the point that the decision to begin normalizing policy could be taken at any meeting, starting with the current one.  Therefore, we thought it appropriate that the alternatives include a draft postmeeting statement that announces the beginning of policy normalization and a note operational decisions. assumption that the Committee will not choose funds rate at this meeting, the key issue, taking as given your principle of data dependence, is how to characterize the economic outlook and remaining three alternatives approach this issue exhibit reviews some evidence now on a on three questions:  whether uncertainty about the economic degree of uncertainty about the timing of the incoming Before turning to these alternatives, my first regarding whether market participants understand that the Committee is meeting-by-meeting basis regarding the timing of liftoff, and that its decisions are data dependent.

to macroeconomic news, where the shaded region shows the period since the bound.  As shown by the red line, from 2010 the end of 2012, the sensitivity of the 2-year yield fell to almost zero as rates over the next two years.  The sensitivity of yield, by contrast, has declined from its recent peak during the taper is now at a historically normal level. The middle-right panel provides some evidence regarding the second question, whether interest rates are as sensitive to incoming economic news as one should expect.  The panel shows indexes for the response of the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields federal funds rate reached the lower until markets-correctly-anticipated that short-term rates would remain at the lower bound for at least a few years.  Since then, the sensitivity has retraced much of this decline and is now closer to normal levels, as economic news now has a meaningful effect on expectations of short-term the 10-year tantrum and a macroeconomist's perspective, macroeconomic news explains only shows that, the level of short-term interest rates one year ahead red line in the middle right, and since early begun to move back toward more normal levels, although it still has some hence turn, reflect the strength of market in the lower-right shows the average probability distribution across primary target increases during the first year of tightening, on the federal funds rate target not returning to its current range.  These a that economic Sadly, from a small fraction of overall interest rate variations.  The lower-left panel more generally, uncertainty about has followed a broadly similar path to the 2014 it has way to go.  The fact that uncertainty about the federal funds rate one year remains well below historical norms could, in participants' conviction of a very gradual pace of tightening once it begins.  The panel dealers of the federal funds rate conditional probabilities are tightly clustered around roughly 100 basis points per year, with only negligible odds on economic scenarios under which the Committee would tighten at pace faster than what was considered 'measured' in the mid-2000s, indicated by the vertical line.  It is not clear whether the high probability mass around roughly 100 basis points per year reflects a high degree of confidence

there is a economic conditions for the first met, and financial market prices seem reasonably either because they come to anticipate a greater likelihood of a historically am reviewing are unreliable Summing up, the evidence presented on this exhibit suggests that healthy dispersion of probabilities over when the tightening will have been responsive to economic news.  Yet, financial markets may still throw a 'liftoff tantrum,' more-normal pace of tightening, or because the data I guides to market expectations.

top of the second exhibit outline how the draft language in B, and C address the range of possible assessments that the Committee make about economic developments over the intermeeting period and their Committee's criteria for beginning indicate that the economy is expanding to characterize the labor market in terms of the pace would inflation is still running below 2 percent, it would temper that by noting that 'earlier declines in energy prices' have been a factor in that 'energy prices appear to have stabilized.'  The Committee's B would repeat the guidance in paragraph 3.  All told, the draft in alternative B would communicate that some progress has been made the last meeting on both of the Committee's criteria for policy firming, but that Turning to your consideration of today's decision and the postmeeting statement, the bullet points at the alternatives A, might implications for progress toward the normalization.  Alternative B would moderately and would continue at which underutilization is diminishing.  Although the Committee acknowledge that observation holding down inflation and report assessment of the outlook in paragraph 2 of alternative B is basically unchanged:  The Committee continues to anticipate that, with appropriate policy accommodation, the economy will expand moderately, leading to further progress toward the goals.  And alternative language since the Committee, while expecting further progress, remains data dependent and will decide on the stance of policy on a meeting-by-meeting basis.

alternative B would allow for the same time, it warrant a later start. By retaining all future meetings as live options, possibility that policy firming could begin in July or September.  At the would also leave open the possibility that data on the economy might evolve in a way that would likely timing of when it has seen appreciable progress toward meeting its criteria for beginning policy that the target federal funds rate is close.  In contrast to alternative B, 1 and 2 of alternative C would use language more closely tied to the to underutilization of labor While alternative B would not tip your hand regarding the the conditions for liftoff will have been met, alternatives C or A would send such a signal.  With the language in alternative C, the Committee would convey the view that normalization and thus it would likely be read by the public as suggesting first increase in the paragraphs Committee's stated criteria for increasing the target range for the federal funds rate. In paragraph 1, the Committee would indicate that it has seen 'some improvement in labor market conditions,' and by omitting the reference resources, might leave the impression that such underutilization has mostly vanished.

confidence in the outlook for inflation, has In addition, paragraph 2 would express greater indicating that 'the risk of inflation running persistently below 2 percent diminished.'

toward meeting the criteria of policy firming and would likely push out market expectations for and inflation are to the downside.  The concern about inflation would be sufficiently strong that the criteria for policy normalization, stating in 3 and 4 that inflation would need to be anticipated to reach 2 percent the Committee is prepared to use all its tools to meet The views on economic activity and the outlook in alternative A would instead suggest that the Committee has seen little further progress for the start policy tightening into the tail of the current distribution.  Paragraph 2 would indicate that the risks to the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, all Committee would strengthen the paragraphs within one to two years and that that criterion.

my briefing, I want to conclude with some remarks As I noted at the beginning of on alternative C′ and on the staff proposal for communicating details of the Committee's operational approach to implementing policy when policy firming commences.  We would very much appreciate your comments on these during the Q&amp;A period and the policy go-round.

at the bottom of the page, the most to update the how the Committee will approach subsequent adjustments in range.  Following from the existing forward guidance, the proposed in paragraph 3 of alternative C′ would, first, reiterate that the Committee's to economic and financial developments and their language in C′ would Committee expects that the economic outlook will warrant a gradual increase, the assessment that even after employment and inflation are near may, for some time, warrant keeping the Committee's assessment of the appropriate path for the federal as economic conditions evolve, the proposed language adds the target range will be data driven. As highlighted in the first set of bullet points significant change that you will need to make to a postmeeting statement announcing the initial increase in the target range for the federal funds rate will be forward guidance about the target language decisions will be made in response implications for the economic outlook, so as to promote the mandated objectives.  In line with your current SEP responses, the draft explicitly note that the and would retain mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions the target federal funds rate below longer-run normal levels.  However, in order to communicate that funds rate might change that adjustments to that the postmeeting by a document providing the operational details associated repeat the details covered received last week, I will just briefly highlight what we see as communications target range for primary means of conveying the stance of adjustments to the IOER rate and the RRP The final set of bullet points focuses on the staff's proposal statement be accompanied with a change in the federal funds rate target.  Rather than in the memo that you the advantages of this approach.  The Committee's previous regarding policy normalization have indicated that adjustments to the the federal funds rate will remain its monetary policy, and that the Board's Committee's instructions to the Desk regarding the operation of the ON

A separate document concerning may prove to be particularly useful in the event that the needs to make an intermeeting adjustment to the operational tools after an unchanged these tools without highlighting their differences in facility-and possibly other tools-are intended to be used to help maintain the federal funds rate within the target postmeeting statement focus clearly and simply on your decision about policy and the reasons for that decision, while avoiding the could arise from including additional information on the use adjustments implementation details Committee the commencement of policy firming to keep the federal funds rate in target range.  In addition, the document on policy implementation would consolidate information about the use of governance.

directives are the draft directive for alternative C′ incorporates that were discussed in the June 10 memo, while the draft directive for the making several changes proposed in the same directive up-to-date.  If first change is to managing conditions in reserve markets-which is not how target range.  In the second paragraph, the rewording of the first sentence avoids misinterpretation that 'its policy' refers to the Desk's rather than the effects on the sheet, seems no longer necessary.  In particular, the Rules of Organization the SOMA manager is responsible for keeping the Committee informed and transactions made for the SOMA, and these reports have Copies of all four draft alternatives and their associated policy attached to my exhibits.  Note that the changes other alternatives offers the option of memo that are intended as 'housekeeping' items to bring the you will turn to page 14 of your packet, you will see that the eliminate the reference to you are now conducting policy-and add the specific reference to the federal funds rate the possible Committee's.  And, finally, the last sentence, which was added in December 2008 when emergency lending and the first LSAP were having substantial balance dictate that about market conditions become a regular feature of each meeting.

at If you have thoughts on whether these changes should be made to the directive this time, please note them in your discussion during the go-round.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Why don't we have a round of questions for Thomas, morning.  Questions?  President Rosengren. CHAIR and then we'll be in a position to begin tomorrow have a question on the tradeoff between data and forward guidance.  When I look at the probability that you have in your toppanel in exhibit 1, we have a roughly 45 percent probability of moving in September, and comes in as forecast, that probability would improve on its own as we get MR. ROSENGREN.  Well, I just dependence right presumably, if the data into July.

June 16-17, 2015

that much closer to 80 or 90 percent, since we wouldn't that additional increase would be as we get into September, particularly if the moved into an speeches and in what we've put into the statement. I guess the goal would be to get be comfortable that 45 or 55 was quite enough.  And I just want to think about what the relative benefit of getting data surprises us in August and we end up having to backtrack.  So we've environment in which we've tried to avoid forward guidance, and we've really highlighted data dependence in cost and benefit of adding in language that moves away much additional benefit we Can you give me the relative from data dependence-to tip our hat a little bit more-and how would get from tipping our hat versus what happens if we tip our hat and turn out to be wrong?

So I don't have a clear view on what should be some kind of target right before the meeting?  It would seem to me that probably there is going to be economic conditions and whether certain amount of judgment-that is very a simple formula.  So my sense is that you wouldn't want to raise that a particular meeting-that would be a serious impediment. MR. LAUBACH. value for this probability.  Would it be ideal if, in fact, market expectations were close to 100 percent some residual uncertainty simply because your assessment of they warrant liftoff or not always will involve a difficult to boil down to probability too high, in that you would want to avoid leaving the impression that expectations are being completely piled up on liftoff at here is more that market participants should simply be sufficiently attuned to that you may judge the data as being consistent with liftoff being warranted at that it is not being perceived as a breakdown in communications.  More generally that there was a time when forward guidance could be used in a fairly hard threshold strategy, in which you could make firm My thinking the fact meeting, so that speaking, my sense is data-dependent sense, like we did with your commitments that before 6½ was crossed, the conversation would not even begin.  At this point,

June 16-17, 2015

so close to these criteria, I think it is just very difficult to lay out very which economic conditions we will see as warranting liftoff I'm afraid I'm not giving you a very precise answer, but I think that probabilities in this however, when you are precise, specific guidance of exactly ex ante. range or higher should be fine.

around 50 percent.  And at the time, most Fed would taper, there was a pretty wide range of views there, and that actual meeting. MR. POTTER.  I could give some history, just quickly.  If we look back to September 2013, the probability of a taper, on average, was people thought that the was about that it doesn't really get been a direct telegraphing that it's going to happen-if a big wide range of views, so some people are still at 30 and some are at 90 or in because we don't know who the marginal is.  Is the marginal investor the one at 30 percent or the one at 90 percent?  But right is between 30 and 70 the data could come in and you would decide to lift trying to say on the data dependence.  But the the September meeting about these probabilities, I think, is I remember Governor Powell trying to think through that for the taper I think if the average was 70 percent-and the history shows that much higher than that unless there's there's still something, then that's not a great situation to be investor now, the spread, which is the only thing I emphasized-nearly everyone percent.  So they think it's reasonable that off in September-that's sort of what you were issue of how you're going to feel at fundamentally different. decision, whether 50-50 was reasonable enough or not.  It might be a 50-50 decision in September.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman.

DUDLEY.  I just want to add something to that.  The market is VICE CHAIRMAN going to have an SEP in front of them that they can look at, which has projections for

June 16-17, 2015

pieces together.  I think the issue is going to be, if the data diverge is then how much of a divergence do you need you take the SEP as it's written likely this unemployment, GDP, and inflation.  So if the data evolve in a way consistent with that, they're going to start putting the significantly from that forecast, the question before you start to change your expectations.  But I think if today, if things evolve pretty much in line with that, then the probability in September is going to harden as opposed to dissipate, particularly because the market will have information in front of it.

messaging in July, the minutes, and any MR. POTTER.  I think it really depends on the speeches that are made, as well, though, how high the probability is.

CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Of course. VICE

Bullard, then CHAIR YELLEN.  Let's see.  I've got two two-handers.  First, President President Rosengren.

Vice Chairman Dudley said.  I are very few that for this 5 percent.  So, basically, everyone in the market MR. BULLARD.  I just wanted to follow up on what think as you get close to the meeting, the probabilities do tend to coalesce.  There meetings at which you come in and the market is really 50-50 on what we're going to do, because the data have come in in some way that kind of dictates.  And you can see meeting, where the probability has fallen under decided we're not going to do anything now.

When I look back, it's not quite that black or white.  It is definitely true in meetings where a big policy action being taken, it's not as if everyone is at 100 percent-they might get to 75 or 80.  So it's not as zero at this meeting, for which there's been less discussion.  If you're MR. POTTER. recently that you've had the probability close to zero, but is black and white as the

June 16-17, 2015

tends to push the getting close to a policy change, there's been more discussion, and that probability up.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Rosengren.

Just a follow-up to what the Vice Chairman said, that one of the to what we used to do is that we have an SEP now.  It should convey the degree table with when rates are going to go up. SEP adequately gives that degree of certainty or projections for the funds rate, and whether it is actually that meeting to meeting on top of that. MR. ROSENGREN. changes relative of certainty among the participants around the Regarding the marginal benefit of using language to characterize what's already embedded in the SEP, I'd just be interested whether you think the variation based on the participants' much of a benefit to add language from that's a very fair point.  You have this new VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think innovation, so you're communicating a lot.  Do you actually need something in the statement that reinforces that or not?

that no one knows who the dots are, so there's SEP.  Also, the things that you write down in the SEP relevant to you.  So, for example, the that you can't really factor The problem with the SEP, of course, is still some residual uncertainty in the submissions don't fully summarize everything that's forward momentum in the economy, what was happening in terms of a debt limit, what was happening in terms of the European situation-those could be things into the SEP.

is a very we need to think about:  Do we want forward guidance once we lift off, expectations?  Now, the reason to have forward initially when we take off is, we're worried a little about a taper tantrum, right?  We I was writing some notes to myself about C  tomorrow, and I think there ′ interesting question that or is the SEP sufficient to communicate our guidance

June 16-17, 2015

to underline that, no, we don't think we're going to go very fast, legitimate issue that we need to discuss want to reassure people in order so you shouldn't go very fast either.  But I think it's a some more.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Fischer.

Is this thethis the federal funds rate? MR. FISCHER.  Could I ask, Simon, what exactly is in this chart? MR. POTTER.  It's Thomas's chart, I think.  Is

MR. FISCHER.  Thomas, what's in these data?  Is this every individual giving a probability of what is- are you looking at?  The upper right? Let's take the one implied by federal funds futures. MR. LAUBACH.  Which chart MR. FISCHER.

That's a more complicated thing.  So, very quickly, the upper rightasks each dealer for the modal liftoff and it also asks for the whole probability distribution.  And this here is based on individual respondents' probability distributions.  So that's what you see in right.  In the middle left, this is something based on staff calculations of a in the funds rate at each meeting. MR. LAUBACH. the primary dealer survey asks the question two different ways.  It date for averaging over the the upper so-called step path-namely, what staff is constructing is based on futures data, the probability of individual steps me off that.'  I'm a guy who's going around, saying, 'Well, there's a 70 and a 20 percent there.' MR. FISCHER.  So, I am not going around, saying, 'I am a September guy and nothing is going to move percent probability here

because is not all centered on one date, but that, in fact, there is probability on September and 45 MR. LAUBACH.  I think that's most directly addressed by the upper-right chart, that is telling you that the average dealer a fair dispersion.  The average dealer puts only a 45 percent

June 16-17, 2015

other meetings.  So 45 percent doesn't strike me as a whole lot of also a fair probability thatpercent distributed over conviction.  There is, you know, a preponderance, but there's know where the average dealer puts his money? MR. FISCHER.  Do we

with this chart.  And we faced this could have a quite different belief from what Participants-that's the buy-side two surveys are lining up pretty well right now.  One of the things you might different.  And then, how would you feel about what the to be at that time? MR. POTTER.  We don't, and that's one of the issues during the taper tantrum.  The marginal investor we're measuring, which is why we started the Survey of Market survey.  And the face in September is they look quite market reaction is going

So if we can take the average probability distribution at the one, let's suppose we go along the path we expect to be on and the to market participants what we will do.  So the probability weight will little bit on September from the left, and the question is, what happens on the right in And if some of them move off to the right-saying, for instance, the Committee is the trigger, lot of noise in the market, I assume.  And if it all piles up on September 16 it's obvious that's what we are going to do, then we'll have at the time of the decision.  We'll just have the noise a few weeks before. MR. FISCHER.  All right. timing of liftoff, the top-right data are reasonable, if not absolutely decisive.  We'll have a decision to make in September, but it won't be totally clear pile up a the market? showing some reluctance to pull the trigger or something-then when we do pull we're going to have a and 17, because everybody thinks less noise in the market much noise it's going to cause is really an open question, next three months, say, the all come in strong, the inflation data come in strong, you would see a MR. LAUBACH.  Well, how right?  My expectation would be that, of course, if over the employment reports

have over the slowing of the asset purchase programs that we have the federal funds futures data.  So that should aggregate in a way some The disadvantage we have is, they have to work the range.  So we won't be as precise on this first chance that the taper would realized in the next couple of meetings it was going to happen, and you end, that was quite positive. MR. POTTER.

When the decision was made to taper, the probabilities showed at that meeting were, on average, a 25 percent happen.  But everyone just got over that uncertainty.  In the it's really between two meetings-September and what we see-it might not matter as much when you actually decide to go. that point, which could have implications for the markets. So, for example, if everyone thinks December, and that's But if there's a lot of weight on 2016, then there's probably an indication in moving of what the reaction function is at

rather than we don't want to deal with at the same moment. MR. FISCHER.  So why don't we leave out the 'they don't know where it's going to trade in the range.'  Let's simplify by just assuming that we're going to fix a number a range because the range adds a level of complication that analytically

That would be great, and if we were credible that we could hit that point, think at the moment we're credible that we could hit a point MR. POTTER. that would really help.  But I don't target.

MR. FISCHER.  Okay, Thomas.  I'm finished.

June 16-17, 2015

I think more interesting is what happens further out along very low.  So if this was associated with a market pull-up in forward rates further could be because market participants somehow changed their views about the fundamental about the reaction function.  Then response of longer-term rates. MR. LAUBACH.  One other point, and I may come to regret these words, but my expectation would be that, literally, if the only thing that would shift is, say, probability mass from December toward September, that, in itself, would be my expectation, and it shouldn't cause a very strong market reaction. the yield curve because, as you've seen from Simon's charts, a bigger puzzle is why far forward rates are still out, it strength of the economy or because they changed their views you could get a substantially larger

MR. FISCHER.  Okay.  Thank you.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota.

Chair.  I had a one-hander, but I'll two-hander to contribute to this really important conversation.  I more concerned about uncertainties being present in September.  As I listen to you a key element that was the disconnect that we've seen between the employment data and the activity. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam convert the first part of it into a think that I'm speak, Madam Chair, and I listen to the Vice Chairman speak, I think that both of you stressed data on real lot of information about employment before our September meeting. potential for ongoing disconnect.  I listen to the nowcast 2 percent for the second quarter-that might be sort of where we're at in terms of may continue to see ongoing labor market improvement. will be very important.  I think that messaging will be very complicated, We're going to get a We're going to get considerably less, I think, about GDP and therefore won't know how the center of the Committee resolves the from Atlanta, GDP numbers in September-but we How that gets resolved

June 16-17, 2015

could well be more uncertainties going into the September meeting than we the June meeting. and so I think there face right now at think the opportunities for messaging I had one last thing about that, which is that I between July and September are more limited just by the nature of the calendar.  We don't talk as much in that time frame, so I think that will, again, add to the challenge.

Thomas's charts as having to do with be data dependent and data sensitive in their assessments. that was a nice try, but it was pretty heroic.  One of the plausible theories about what did was that it tamped down on the influence of any having some presidents out there talking. My second comment was on the interpretation of telling us that markets have learned to I thought the Committee's forward guidance individual speaker's effects on market beliefs.  You are basically shutting down the noise factor that comes from

I've had the conversation with reporters: And then I just show them John's T-shirt, and So all of this is about unconditional variance has gone up.  The only chart that really the middle one on the right, but it's weak evidence. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  No, when the Chair the heart of the Committee.  The Presidents So one theory is, we've created more noise by getting rid of forward guidance-a dependence, so 'What do you guys mean by data dependence?' they say, 'Oh, that's great.  Now I get it.'  [Laughter] variances, and you've nailed it-unconditional speaks to the conditional part is that we have TV My final comment is that there are actually people who have suggested cameras brought into the FOMC room to record what's going on here and show it, probably on

MR. FISCHER.  We notice you're getting out before [Laughter]

CHAIR

just a question.  Thomas, Simon has got to deal with it-it's on page 14, this issue about the I'm just naïve or ignorant on this.  The existing sentence says, 'In particular, the in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range MR. WILLIAMS.  I have a very pedestrian question, and it's you opened this up, but directive. Committee seeks conditions from 0 to ¼ percent.'

that was kind of right, and I thought that would be very right when we raise the 25 to 50 basis points.  I thought it was exactly the right sentence, and you're out and fixing the next sentence, which is actually the problem:  'The I thought we for the of years in order to hit the range.  My understanding of our policy strategy is, we set I thought range from suggesting striking that Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary.' weren't doing open market operations and we had no plan to do open market operations next couple IOER, we use overnight reverse repo with some cap.  Now, you can call that-

I just find it a funny change to make at this time says our strategy of normalization is to use repo and other facilities, and we're being very explicit about how MR. WILLIAMS.  I know, but that's not the way it's which when we have this other statement out there that IOER, to use overnight reverse

June 16-17, 2015

for open market operations-when I say mean the kind of things that we traditionally have done.  So I was curious.  This is a federal funds rate trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent'? these are done, and, really, there's no active role 'active,' I question.  What is wrong with just saying, 'The Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with the

If you say that without anything else, are you saying you would delete MR. POTTER. the next sentence?

sentence. the directive a couple of years ago to modernize the first you have seeks.  And then the Committee has directed the Desk as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate, and these market operations that we'd like to do. MR. WILLIAMS.  No, I would just modify it in a way that you find appropriate. MR. POTTER.  I think when we were thinking about this, this was a 'legacy' So some changes were made to sentence in it, and in particular when you go to C , which is on page 15, the idea is that ′ the first sentence-that's what the FOMC to undertake open market operations are the open

MR. WILLIAMS.  Right.

supposed to be clear to the market and the public that that's what more just trying to clean up the language, and for minutes, it should be pretty clear to market participants what you could slot in if you did lift off, really not trying to affect directly, each day, the amount It will be through the open market MR. POTTER.  So it's we're talking about, and it still leaves open-if necessary, if it turns out that the federal funds rate is firm in some unusual way-that we have the directive that we could do the more traditional operation, which would be a repo operation.  We're not sure how effective it would be, but that's the thinking that we have, and it's me this gives a signal of being ready if it was introduced in the directive for the June because which is this next statement.  And we're of reserves on banks' balance sheets to achieve that goal.

MR. WILLIAMS.  I understand everything you said.  It just seemed to be a funny thing to be changing now because we put so much effort into this normalization plan, and it there's something happening here.  I

If the Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations such conditions-that's conditions in reserve markets-but we're really in the repo market.  That was the to change it.  You could just leave it in and slot MR. POTTER. as necessary to maintain doing the effort through the temporary open market operations thinking.  But I agree with you.  You don't have in the- it when we actually lift off.  Okay.  I was just asking MR. WILLIAMS.  And then change the question of why you want to do it now, and you've answered.

PARTICIPANT.  Good

Unless somebody has a matter of business, I think we are ready to to make a couple of brief very briefly on the staff's proposed communicating the details of monetary policy implementation. CHAIR YELLEN. begin our policy round.  And, if you would not mind, I would just like comments to start us off.  In particular, I wanted to comment plan for the plan that Thomas has set out, and that was discussed in the rather than getting into the details of implementation.  I think lets us accurately report matters pertaining to the different governance of required.  Importantly, I separate note is that it enables us to publish the domestic policy to the Desk at the time our policy statement is released rather than in the minutes, practice.  And I think this is an important step forward in transparency. My personal view is that memo, makes a lot of sense.  As Thomas noted, having an implementation note as a separate document keeps the focus of our policy statement on our choice of the federal funds target range and the rationale for that choice this approach will end up simplifying our communications regarding the stance of policy, and I think the separate note the different tools and for announcing changes to those tools if they're think an advantage of having this directive which has long been our

to decide today in connection with the of what Thomas called of liftoff. Now, as Thomas noted, we do have an issue directive, and that pertains to whether we should make some 'housekeeping changes' at this meeting that would set us up for making fewer changes to the directive later on, at the time changes today, the minutes would make it clear that such changes any change in policy.  But I also realize that some observers could over-interpret If we do make these don't signal

June 16-17, 2015

I don't think this is a critical issue housekeeping issues and about the new implementation note, and I think that's if we were to end up making the housekeeping changes and putting out the the time of liftoff, the fact that it would be covered in our meeting minutes means it a complete surprise to market participants. these changes.  So, for my part, I can go either way on this. for us.  One way or another, I think the minutes will summarize the discussion that we have about these worthwhile, so that new note at wouldn't be

With those comments as background, I look forward to hearing your views on these issues and, of course, your comments on policy choices we have for today.  Let me start with President Rosengren.

Core PCE 1.2 percent, has been falling, not rising, and the U-3 unemployment rate has rather than continuing to improve. MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support option B.  We certainly would not want our first tightening of default of a developed country.  Because of the uncertainties the appropriate time for the first tightening, even if the domestic initially had been met.  However, in my view, both conditions over the past year, at leveled off that the most been premature tightenings.

I agree that a separate note on absolutely makes sense, and I think we should do it.  I would prefer that the the directive be timed at liftoff rather than at the current time.  I am concerned that maybe over-interpret the announcement going out with the minutes of this meeting. In terms of the areas that the Chair has asked us to discuss, operational tools changes to people will

And, finally, just in terms of the comments regarding data dependence and the tradeoff between data dependence and providing forward guidance, my preference would be that the statement be data dependent and

I'm sure, if need be, the Chair, the Vice Chairman, and others will have the hardwire things in the While I take President Kocherlakota's comments be giving speeches, capability to are dramatically different than we think is appropriate.  I would rather not statement that could turn out to be negated if data surprised us once again on the weak side.  So that, to the extent forward guidance is going to be used, it not be is much more flexible to do it in a speech than it is in a statement. that the summertime is not a wonderful time to schedule in August if it seems like the probabilities that people are putting on liftoff used in the statement.

So we managing any technical adjustments monetary policy statements, if the adjustments take place between scheduled FOMC meetings.

I find nothing analogous to be true when thinking about the economy.

People say they can't fix history, but economists never seem to tire of trying.

My third observation is that, as challenging as it have found it even more difficult to predict the future.  I don't the same.  For my part, the zero lower bound is a plausible and credible set of reasons to break free.  Liftoff has a stigma that must be overcome, much like pulling this Committee will continue to lead with confidence to a new soft landing in represented the Philadelphia Reserve I know that a more normalized economy.

As a result, gathering more evidence warranted at this stage.

I remain convinced that the time for liftoff is fast approaching and that waiting federal funds rate risks falling behind the curve.  Doing so could rate increases after liftoff, which may confuse and disrupt markets Of course, I understand that our liftoff is a discrete adjustment and this as pulling a tooth.  So I'm probably even more worried Rosengren appropriately where other central banks tightened policy too That said, it is important to remind ourselves that our than instances.  Looking ahead to potential future policy statements and the issue of forward are two issues of forward guidance on which we want to be clear.  President the forward guidance in our statements over the next few should not be reintroducing nearThat said, much longer to raise the ultimately necessitate steeper here and across the globe. one that's difficult to undertake because of the concern that our actions may prove premature. Actually, I never even thought about about it now, going back to my childhood.  [Laughter]  But as President said, we can point to numerous cases in the past quickly, leading to undesirable outcomes. economic fundamentals are much sounder and our policy stance much more accommodative in those guidance, there Rosengren, you were talking about meetings, and I completely agree with your comments.  We term forward guidance.  I like how our statements are formulated now.

thinking about future language.  In paragraph 3, it says 'The I think there is another issue about forward guidance that is also in this discussion, and this refers to alternative C′,

June 16-17, 2015

that the economy will evolve in a manner that warrants a increase in the target range for the federal funds rate' and has the other language about interest rates.  I think this is an interesting topic about whether we want to introduce in the forward guidance of that type, the 'gradual increase.'  I think that is something we based on what happens between now and then. Committee currently anticipates gradual low future some are going to have to see that I just mentioned, that the longer we wait to start the target range choice of language in the future depending obviously on how the target range.  If we wait significantly longer, then I think that that would not be I also think that there is the issue liftoff, the less likely it is that it will be appropriate to have a gradual increase in of the funds rate.  So I do see the long it is until we start liftoff.  If we do it sooner, then I think that would support a gradual increase in quite appropriate.

monetary policy implementation and directives, I'm fully language you mentioned, Madam Chair, and that is described between monetary policy decisions and what I the technicalities needed to achieve those decisions.  And I think it's also important memo notes, this distinction would allow for modest adjustments in implementation, that monetary policy has somehow changed when In terms of the memo on supportive of the approach and the in the memo.  It is good to distinguish clearly would call that, as the if needed, without necessitating additional FOMC statements.  This ensures that we avoid sending an incorrect signal to the public actually we're just making a technical implementation adjustment.

it could go way, but I do tend to lean toward not wanting to put new directive language in this time that we're signaling that we're preparing something, that it might be Regarding the directive, I agree with your comments, Madam Chair, that either just out of nervousness

As you recall, that analysis incoming data are holding back the model's longer-run inflation outlook. For today's recent softer economic data and preferred appropriate monetary policy liftoff date to midyear 2016.

Indeed, in our January 2012 SEP submissions, 16 out of 17 of the long-run federal funds rate dots were consistent with r * being between 2 and 2½ percent.

Today the Tealbook assumes r * is 1½ percent, in line with its lower assessment for productivity growth and potential output growth.  And the Committee's June SEP submissions

In reviewing the policy options in preparation for this meeting, one of our economists posited that we may find ourselves in a situation like Jurassic Park .

So I lean evolved since our April appropriate data.  We have some concern, though, that B has to the SEP package, the majority of participants federal funds target range in September of 2015 or earlier.  This indicates substantially greater probability think, according to the charts presented yesterday.  Therefore, communications that help bring public perceptions more in line with those of the Committee will be

In response to the request yesterday, I have a couple of comments on alternative C . ′ First, in currently the target range for the federal funds rate,' even if it is true.  It is my understanding that the federal funds rate path prescribed by optimal control rules are quite sensitive to financial policy rate path could steepen in response to completely plausible changes in circumstances. Saying that the Committee expects a gradual policy rate path without also communicating the substantial sensitivity of that expectation to changes in the outlook could give private decisionmakers a distorted view of how policy may evolve.  If warning about the degree to which normalization's pace will economic outlook changes should also be included.  Overall, we prefer to let private analysts draw their own inferences about reduce accommodation.  It to or include the pertinent language from the Committee's Principles and Plans, which states that reinvestments will continue until the normalization process. It also seems confusing in paragraph 4 to indicate that reinvesting principal and rolling over maturing Treasuries is designed to 'help maintain accommodative financial conditions' in the same communication that conveys the Committee's decision to would be better to make reference Policy Normalization later in

Finally, with respect to the proposals on communicating the details for implementation at liftoff, I think the proposal presented is very sensible, and I support proceeding as described. Thank you.

'some improvement in labor market conditions,' as in C, rather than to diminishing 'underutilization of labor resources,' as in alternative B, this language more closely relates to the further improvement language in our liftoff to give some indication that the risk of inflation running 2 percent has diminished because this ties directly to reasonable confidence the inflation outlook, another of the liftoff criteria.  In paragraph 3, I prefer the C language that modifies the liftoff criteria, adding the word 'some' to characterize in the labor market.  This acknowledges the improvement in the March and that we are closer to meeting the the Committee better toward liftoff and beyond. of the alternative C language today.  For example, in paragraph 1, to characterize the labor market, I would prefer to refer to alternative because criteria.  In paragraph 2, I'd prefer persistently below regarding alternative the improvement we need to see labor market since the language was adopted in criteria for liftoff.  In addition, I continue to think that providing a longer-run perspective on economic developments than is currently done in paragraph 1 would serve as we move we should be data dependent.  Data dependence risks being interpreted as systematic.  I think we need to use our tools of I do believe being focused on the short run and being less communication to try to avoid that interpretation.  A longer-run focus, I think, would help in that respect.

Lack of that groundwork could cause us to feel compelled to keep delaying liftoff because of the risk of surprising the markets or, should we

Monetary policy meetings regarding IOER rate to support the policy the FOMC statement from the implementation details of the tools, as suggested in the memo, that's an Regarding the monetary policy implementation memo, I am proposed approach of separating the not concerned about the governance remains the responsibility of the FOMC, and we've discussed at earlier normalization that the Board of Governors will be setting the intentions of the FOMC.  But if separating would bring less focus to the governance aspects added benefit of the proposal.

authorizations to the Chair of making modest IOER and ON RRP rates is the timing of the resolutions, not the explain what my concern is.  Suppose we haven't had in the early stages of liftoff.  Then if we delegate be read as something has changed, and somehow we've lost and have to make intermeeting changes?  Will it things are getting harder?  My one suggestion would be that if we do wait to adopt a memo, we mention in the minutes that such delegation of Chair is expected to come at a later date once liftoff is under way. The only concern I have about the intermeeting adjustments in the delegation of authority, and so let me just to make any intermeeting changes in the rates authority later in the process, will it control or think we're going to lose control sound like resolution as proposed in the staff authority to the

We're trying to hedge in the direction of the economy getting more toward normal, so we're trying to move Certainly, the data that come in over have to have the idea that we'll be opportunistic in our first policy move.  Also, once the policy move, obviously we're still going to be our bets policy more toward normal, but we're still going to be very accommodative.

Prescheduling that meeting and that will be perfect, but life often doesn't work out perfectly. more flexible approach in which every meeting is, ex ante, We would like to take opportunities like September is going to work against this principle.  I mean, maybe the data will come in great right before Anything we can do to try to get to a

I don't think the Committee is really ready to think in moving opportunistically, but that's how we're going to have to move over the can, in our own minds, get toward that kind of an attitude, method that would actually implement that, I think would be helpful. identical terms of normalization process.  The more we and then maybe get to a

SEP paths being given according to an I think when we talk about that the projections are put forward under an optimal policy might all be using different models.  Within those different models, policy and so the various forecasts are not all made on the same basis. where the privateforecaster is also trying to forecast what this Committee will do and will give you an outthat you would then evaluate against mean-squared criterion or something like Here we're saying, given the models we have, we're putting something in under an optimal it if we'd mention this when we talk about the SEP I don't think that they are the same thing as the unconditional forecasts given in the I have two comments on the SEP.  One is about optimal policy assumption, and the second is about the horizon.  First, the SEP, we need to clarify to people assumption.  We might be somewhat different, They are not unconditional forecasts the way private-sector forecasts are, sector and-out forecast that. policy within that model.  So I'd appreciate because private sector.

I'm using.  So if you miss the time when the model said you should have lifted off, going to get worse outcomes going forward than you otherwise could have achieved earlier.  But given that you didn't move, there's some optimal policy cause federal to shift because we're not all exactly on the same timing schedule.  So got these dot paths shifting around.  That may not be indicating a change in the sentiment For me, missing a rate rise means worse outcomes for the economy, according to the model that then you're if you had raised rates going on from that point.  Over the normalization phase, I think this effect will funds rate dot paths you've

June 16-17, 2015

this.  I know that it doesn't go very far when I talk to people this Committee.  I know that we all understand it here, but the SEP is a different object that are often cited. of the Committee as to where we are or what we need to do but is a detail of how the SEP is put together.  So I try to emphasize outside from the private-sector forecasts second comment on the SEP is that the horizon shifts through the year.  That's interpretation of what it otherwise could be.  What people really want to know is, what's two-year-ahead outlook in a format that they can digest and see what The something that we've always done, but I think it is kind of odd, and it warps the the SEP compared with your year-ahead outlook and your two-year-ahead outlook?  We should always be giving them a year-ahead outlook and a we're saying.

if that was unexpected, and then we all think that the future looks worse We're saying that that was an four quarters and the four quarters beyond that might look same as they did before, and so that we have not perhaps changed our views that to something SEP, it might be an improvement.  I understand that that's a little bit different IMF would do it, or how other people would do it, but on the other hand, What's happening is, you get a bad first quarter.  Well, everyone has to mark down their forecast for the year than we previously said, but that isn't really what's going on. unexpected shock, and that the next roughly the much on how the economy is going to evolve going forward.  So if we could get like that in the from how, let's say, the we're trying to convey what our outlook is, given the data we have today, then going forward from here-four-quarter, eight-quarter horizons.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lockhart. CHAIR

Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support the policy decision in today, I am very hopeful that will gel to allow liftoff in September.  Looking ahead, I am at a similar place as the idea of a very soft progression from language like that in B today to alternative C in July as being a sensible approach to providing some slight in the July statement, if it seems appropriate.  At the July statement, if changes in paragraphs 2 and 3 in today's alternative C might provide a hint of MR. LOCKHART. alternative B and the statement as written.  As I see things conditions President Mester.  I like alternative foreshadowing of liftoff the data overall continue to reflect modest continuing improvement, then language along the lines of the forward guidance.

the proposal to separate the rationale for the policy decision from the is 'meaningfulness to markets.'  The staff has listed several changes to the issues-that are unrelated to liftoff and can be These details strike me as worthwhile interest of clarity and accuracy but not particularly meaningful to market participants.  So I I agree with implementation of the policy decision at liftoff.  In considering the specifics of communication, my guiding principle directive-the so-called housekeeping communicated immediately if the Committee so chooses. in the favor holding off and communicating these changes when we publish the implementation note at liftoff.

the question of when and how to communicate the the caution and prudence with which we are preparing operationally for In contrast, it seems to me that temporary suspension, at liftoff, of the current overnight reverse repo cap is meaningful to markets.  Reflecting

Presuming Chair. liftoff, I think it would be prudent to participants to plan for the liftoff period and so should help achieve a a September liftoff, the minutes of this meeting or the July meeting seem to me a good tool to communicate this decision.  Thank you, Madam

CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.

Chair.  I am going to make the dangerous my script.  My research director is probably blanching as I say this. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam step of trying to actually respond on the fly to some of the things I have heard as opposed to sticking to me.  At the risk of putting mouth, I worry that our approach of being data dependent is leading us to not be as when we see it.'  And I'm not sure that is really making decisions for policy.  Alternative B, I think, is very challenging for the public informing our decisions about liftoff. Something that President Mester said really resonated with words in her sufficiently strategic in our thinking about policymaking.  I think one of the benefits of actually being as explicit as alternative A is-for example, about the criteria for liftoff-is that it forces us internally to also be explicit in our thinking about, what are our criteria for liftoff?  I worry that data dependence is a code for 'we'll know it as helpful as it could be for markets and for the public, to know what actually we are looking for in terms of to know what actually is going to be

to listen for what the risk-management at.  One concern I have heard is that if rates more rapidly than is currently under now, the projected increases that I see in the SEP, for of 75 to 100 basis points per year. As I listen to people around the table, I try considerations are leading folks to the positions they're we wait too long, we are going to have to raise consideration in the outlook.  Right example, are something on the order

June 16-17, 2015

time when the economy is robust enough to withstand that interest rates.  That's a very slow rate of increase in the interest rates, 75 to me to take that risk on board, that we might have to 150 basis points per year, or 200, and that is a material risk here. We should be raising rates at a rate of increase in 100 basis points per year.  So it is hard for go as fast as

President Holcomb's comments were really great.  I think this is is underlying a lot of discussion about the risk of actually driving employment too risk of driving unemployment too low.  And she spoke about it in terms of the by imbalances.  Having said that, I liked her the risk in that way.  I think if that is actually something that is materially on the table, worried about having employment get too high, we need to have some evidence is that we are looking at.  Is this the 1990s kind of period we are technological development going on in Silicon next 15 or 20 years?  Or is it something more like the think knowing where the metrics What exactly should we be looking for beyond simply saying, 'We don't want to think that's a challenging message for how to make monetary I thought that First Vice a risk that high, the cumulative damage to the economy being done framing that we are about what exactly the damage going into, where we are seeing a lot of great Valley that will serve us well for the 2000s, with debt financing of unsustainable consumption?

Part of this is related to increases in the dollar.  Part of it is related to, I think, The dollar comment that we've all heard from all of our interlocutors is, If you look at inflation, I think the path of what we're seeing on the demand side, again, looks weak. increases in yields. 'That sounds like something that is associated with the expectation of tighter monetary policy.'

that labor markets have been relatively has emphasized-and has resulted in very low productivity.  And the real question going to be, how is that going to Are we creating low-demand conditions through our tight monetary policy, or is it Now, the countervailing piece of evidence is strong-relative to demographics, especially.  But as the Vice Chairman you did, too, Madam Chair-that for this Committee over the next few months and into 2016 is get resolved? that we've got some mismeasurement of some kind in GDP that will resolve in our favor?

alternative A because it has more accommodation.  I also like it because I think the Committee to be a little more strategic in the way it is framing the criteria for liftoff, see what happens, and feel right.' But I like it forces thinking about that more collectively, as opposed to, 'We'll wait and we'll go with it if things related to what I have already said, that I think that there is an opportunity now that we to redraft the FOMC statement completely.  I think alternative C  is overly a question of rhetorical elegance.  It is to try to has the first of many complicated steps the Committee is going to be facing. So let me turn to post-liftoff communication issues.  I want to make two points, and the first is should take advantage ′ complex, and I think this redrafting is not just reduce the chances of miscommunication as the FOMC deals with a series of complicated policy issues.  We put a lot of weight on the liftoff decision, but liftoff, as Governor Fischer reminded us, is really

June 16-17, 2015

and as effective as possible to allow us to communicate and We want our statement to be as tight communicate well.

think there are a lot of great ideas out there.  Presidents Williams and Mester have made the statement.  My research director, Sam essay in our annual report with an explicit example of how to a more effective way.  My main emphasis is, I think there is always this continually on the back burner.  We'll wait and wait and wait because we to frighten anybody in the markets by doing this.  I don't think we will be as effective monetary policy if we don't redraft the I past suggestions about how to restructure Schulhofer-Wohl, has a great rewrite the statement in temptation to put this don't want as we need to be during this very challenging phase of statement in a material way, and soon.

Now, in terms of policy implementation, I information in a separate note was a great be clearly subordinate to the Committee's statement of its policy stance.  As drafted, it has that feel already, but I would recommend changing the name even further to subordinate it, to something like Details of currently written.  I think it is important for us to strongly resist the as another form of communication about policy.  There shouldn't be any should be as close to a template as possible so that all we are doing is they are decided. I like the way it is temptation to use it extra language, and it simply filling in relevant numbers as

I believe that is still the thinking of A final point is about clear that the Committee.  There are good ways to use the minutes of this meeting and others closer to liftoff as being appropriate ways to accomplish that goal.

June 16-17, 2015

just summarize what I am trying to say about post-liftoff communication.  I really simplify the FOMC statement greatly as soon as possible.  My staff is they can.  And I favor a separate note about the details monetary policy implementation, as the staff has suggested.  That should be as close to a I will think we need to work to ready to help in that effort in any way that of template as we can possibly get, in which only numbers are changed.

In terms of the housekeeping changes now or later, my own perspective less likely to run into complications minutes-not front and center in terms of communication.  So I would suggest making them now, but I don't feel

being consistent FOMC minutes that the MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative C as with the data-dependent policy and with the statement in the previous Committee's decision to begin normalizing policy would appropriately be determined on a meeting-by-meeting basis.

March meeting minutes noted that further market, stabilization of energy prices, and a leveling out of the foreign helpful in establishing confidence that inflation three months, and broader indicators of labor market registered similar improvement.  Readings on core PCE inflation have remained meeting, we've the dollar has been relatively stable, which together give me transitory effects will dissipate.  In addition, our policy rules continue to point to In terms of the criteria for liftoff, the improvement in the labor exchange value of the dollar would all be seen as would turn up.  Since March, we've seen progress around each of those criteria.  Employment growth has averaged 207,000 over the past activity have largely stable on a year-over-year basis since December.  And, since the April seen oil prices drift higher while confidence that

With the combination of these factors, and understanding that that it is time to begin the process for higher rates, and the byproduct of our highly incentives of searching for higher yield and the willingness interest rate expectations monetary policy operates with long lags, I believe normalizing policy.

This asymmetry is hard to overcome, and it risks pushing back the date of liftoff as we wait to see a In terms of today's decision, market expectations for liftoff are clearly focused on September, with a skew data point-a soft employment report, similar to expectations back to December.  Yet for all the hand-wringing about the employment numbers remained solid and growth seems to be on a relatively firm footing.  Yet the strong employment report going to be consistent streak of strong data.

I noted that more than the usual came in consistent with made to raise the funds rate target.  To me, it's have been pretty consistent with our April expectations.  In fact, in the one-tenth higher than it was at the MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  In April amount of data was scheduled to come in by this meeting, and that, if it our projections, I thought a strong case could be clear that the data Tealbook projection for the first half, real GDP growth is now previous meeting.

also now apparent that we're in the midst of the longest sustained improvement in have clearly move 2 percent target. It is household spending growth we've seen in this recovery.  Labor market conditions improved as well.  We've continued strong growth in employment and job openings, and since the April meeting, we've seen confirmation of the expected rebound in core inflation.  So I believe we have good reason to be confident that, barring further shocks, inflation will back to our all on board, my preference would be to raise rates at this meeting.  Raising to the economic data we have in hand, increase would still leave us with a highly accommodative policy stance, a Fischer made eloquently last time.  I will not vote against keeping rates are Taking this rates now would be a natural and understandable response and a quarter-point point Governor unchanged today, however.  I understand the concerns of those for whom the incoming data not yet completely convincing, and I do not think we would be making a terribly costly mistake

June 16-17, 2015

raise rates.  It would raise the risk of getting behind the at this point, tolerably so, I think. by waiting another meeting or two to curve, but that the risk would rise if the data come in in line with our projections over several months and we don't raise rates.  In addition, I see risk going forward of our data becoming something of a one-way ratchet mechanism, as described by President points, lead us to delay those soft data points does not lead to a movement bringing the expected liftoff backward in time.  Our data ought to be symmetric in this respect.  More broadly, as we go into this, we should always going to be concerns.  Soft data points will always turn up from I do believe the next dependence George, in which the emergence of new reasons for concern, soft data expected liftoff, but the dissipation or passing of commensurate offsetting dependence recognize that there are time to time, and the prospect of certainty just around the corner is something of a mirage.

the language of alternative C to that of alternative B. it better reflects reality right now.  Any remaining immaterial, I believe, and I think that the risk of inflation has diminished significantly. Regarding the statement, I prefer President Mester was open about this.  I think underutilization of labor resources is running below 2 percent her concerns about the statement.  In particular, I'd highlight the recitation of what has happened meeting, and I think that gives short shrift in the statement to the extent to More broadly, I support reliance we've been placing lately on paragraph 1, which is a since the previous which our decision is going to be driven by a longer-run perspective on what's evolved in the economic data.

think we should view it as necessary that we send a message like as a clear signal, as a prerequisite for liftoff.  So we shouldn't wait.  Liftoff should or not we've issued a statement like C.  And, commensurately, a In addition, I don't statement C be a live option whether

should give some very careful thought to the paragraph 3 that talks about 'a gradual increase in the target range.'  I share some of forward guidance language, measured-pace formula that I was a party to a good idea, and my sense is that widely shared misgivings ex post about that.  Maybe it didn't absolutely lock us in to meeting, but it did seem to raise a bar that made it hard to do could suffer the same fate.  It could our scheduled press conference at meeting is going to have this gravitational pull for us that could lead people to 'gradual' means that at every other meeting they raise rates by 25 basis points.' Regarding alternative C , I think we ′ sentence in the concerns that have been expressed about this.  This reintroduces and it's language that's awfully reminiscent of the from 2004 to 2006.  In hindsight, I'm not sure that that was there are moving 25 basis points every single anything but 25 basis points.  And I think the word 'gradual' become identified with moving at every other meeting.  And every other believe, 'Well, language, I think we ought to ask ourselves, what out?  Would it be easy to remove when we thought it was inappropriate, be afraid of being misread by pulling it out?  I think we would be afraid that it for us moving very rapidly very soon, and makes sense.  So I think this deserves a lot of careful thought. In addition, when we introduce new would cause us to pull it or would we would be over-interpreted as a very high probability I'm not sure that

I mean, this is an archaic vestige they're going to need to undertake open market maintain reserves markets consistent with the funds rate trading in the range-we this confusing vestige of a previous regime.  I'd urge says.  It has been this highly coded kind of semaphore to markets and to the more the markets for decades.  Maybe it's time to start from scratch on About the operational note, I think Governor Brainard And, in particular, I'd say if we're going to do some housekeeping on the directive, the thing that really stands out is this sentence that market operations of a previous regime.  We don't anticipate operations to don't think that's going to happen.  So it's the staff to take a much more fundamental and far-reaching look at the directive, its structure, and what it sophisticated Fed watchers in this.  That concludes my remarks, Madam Chair.

I am, therefore, we will soon be able to put in place a decision reflecting language like that we have MR. FISCHER.  I support option B, which does have made further progress toward our goals.

Such an improvement in confidence would have a positive Now, of course, most economic models are not going to make a big deal point move, so it is hard to argue forcefully about mind, there are two additional reasons for getting things started soon.

to go on to a couple of topics raised by yesterday's discussion.  Let me I think we need to discuss at greater length shortly.  The story about other raised rates and then had to reduce them is not actually accurate.  The Swedes I would like mention one that central banks that are very angry that we keep quoting that, and I am guilty of the same sin.  When the economy was recovering and the inflation rate was high, we raised the interest rate in Israel.  When the

June 16-17, 2015

is about-and I assure you that there is going to be a day, whenever we raise ought to do it, Madam Chair, at European crisis began, we reduced it.  They were both appropriate, so I don't understand what the argument interest rates, that we will one day reduce them, and people will say, 'Ha.  You raised them too soon.'  But there is a serious discussion to take place, and we some point.

alternative C , particularly because there is a lot in there about what we Whether it will be gradual or not depends on how the data come in.  That is, it is Thomas also asked us yesterday whether the language in ′ paragraph 3, is acceptable.  My answer is 'Yes,' will change. consistent with data dependence.

don't think it is forward guidance, and I don't think so for a reason that I can make a senior Federal Reserve official say, 'We have two now that we are at the zero lower bound.  One is quantitative easing, and the other is I said, 'But forward guidance must be consistent with your predictions for what you are going to do on quantitative easing.'  And the answer I got instrument.'  It is not an extra instrument. In his notes, Thomas referred to this framework of paragraph 3 as providing forward guidance.  I clear in this forum.  I once heard instruments forward guidance.' the interest rate and for was, 'No, it's an extra providing information about what we think we will knowledge and our current expectations.  Rather, it is that there are the don't think they are optimal from the viewpoint of the future.  That is, there are that are inconsistent with difference.  So I don't think of this as forward guidance; And I think forward guidance is not do, based on our current things we will do in the future, which, because we announce them today, we will do despite fact that we binding commitments that we have entered into in forward guidance data dependence, and that, I think, is the

should make a change to the directive now and additional changes when we commence normalization. With regard to the questions that were asked, a separate implementation note is preferable.  And I join those who don't think we then make dependent.  And if the data falter the economy gets hit by some significant new negative shock, we want to see how caution against interpreting every small weakness as a reason to So let me sum up.  The criteria for beginning normalization have nearly been met, and we should be willing to move very soon.  Of course, we are data again, or things unfold.  But I would also push off normalization.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo. CHAIR

as is a relatively straightforward decision for today. MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B with the language drafted in the Tealbook.  I think that the two criteria that we have injected into our myself again-as you can probably tell from breakdown in some of the traditional labor markets and between wages and price inflation. Looking forward and thinking about decisionmaking for an interest rate increase, I find my remarks yesterday-focused on the apparent relationships, both in thinking about

think that is posing-for me, at least-a challenge in trying to make a decision about off for the first time.  With respect to further improvement in literally, one could say that that criterion had been met almost I when it would be appropriate to lift labor conditions, taken quite

June 16-17, 2015

since there has been some improvement at each step along is that the amount of improvement that people much improvement you think we are very close to or said any further improvement was immaterial. it is easier to make a decision.  But if one is somewhat in the past-that there may be a nontrivial amount of slack left-then may look to is somewhat greater. successively since we first put it in, the way.  But, obviously, the connotation at least are looking for probably depends on the gap that they think exists and how remains to be done.  And so I think some of you indicate that maybe even at the natural rate already, and, therefore, you don't think there is much room for further improvement.  I think President Lacker So, obviously, if you take that view, sympathetic, as I am, to some of the arguments that are made in some of the papers that I cited yesterday and have cited the amount of improvement that I

an even more making a decision on liftoff.  Here I fairly widely shared intuition that the progressive least if the more recent literature can be believed.  And the Peneva-Rudd paper a string of research papers suggesting that that may be the case. With respect to reasonable confidence about inflation, I find that to be slippery criterion to try to get my arms around in terms of think most people are probably relying on a removal of slack in the economy will at some point begin to push up inflation.  But that intuition-which may have been based on some elegant stuff that you all studied or wrote about when you were in graduate school or in the pre-crisis, pre-recession era-may have broken down to some extent, at I cited yesterday was the latest in important to me?  Well, it is important because even though I think we that further removal of slack in the economy-as imperfectly reflected in the tightening well-understood relationship between the progression of wages and the progression Now, why is that all agree of labor market conditions-should translate into upward pressure on inflation at some point, the 'how much' and 'when' actually matter a good deal.  And if we no longer have a kind of reasonably

June 16-17, 2015

into price inflation, that period during which exogenous shocks of some sort might necessary, really, to stave off inflation. of prices, then it makes it a more difficult judgment.  So if, for example, it were a longer period of time that it took for tighter labor markets and rising wages to translate would mean there would be a longer adversely affect the economy.  And so I might be more concerned that moving more quickly would put the economy at some risk and not be relationship, and you don't have something to it may be that price inflation could begin to be apparent even in the absence of growth in nominal wages.  And the reasonable confidence people may have could absence of higher nominal wage growth.  But I do disconcerting to have not even a rough calibration of 'when' and 'how much' is President Williams said yesterday, it recognition that we keep falling short on the inflation target.  I guess that has liftoff.  But precisely because there isn't a nice linear to fit any of this into, it doesn't predetermine the position I will have in September, meeting, for that matter. Now, that can go in the other direction as well.  As I think President Williams pointed out a meeting or two ago, when you break that substitute for it, demonstrable take root a little bit more quickly, even in the find it a bit necessary in order to induce that reasonable confidence.  As is hard to avoid the affected the way I am thinking about relationship or any later

issues that have been raised, as I have said in the past, I hope we rely agree with those who be relying simply on the recitation of the past, which is paragraph 1. the economy to go, which is what paragraph 2 is about, should provide and communication to markets so that they can then adjust their we are likely to move. With regard to the principally on paragraphs 1 and 2 to communicate future intentions.  I think that we shouldn't Stating where we expect some measure of signal assessments of how soon

There which I think would have been worse.  But I would still away from it a little bit.  I am sympathetic to what President Kocherlakota said about it would be better if we had a somewhat more precise set of criteria in paragraph 3, but I trying to make that change now would just result in more confusion rather than more I am all with those who think we should be putting more emphasis on paragraph 2 and What has always timer' analogy, that making a change in paragraph 3 gets people to think, okay, it's one meeting or it's two characterize the degree of labor market improvement have been things proposed in the past tend to shy how fear that clarity. not leaving that boilerplate, but at least have a higher hurdle with respect to paragraph 3.

On the other hand, the more recent me.  The Committee will To me, the case for lifting off at this 'Exhibit A' And I think the market is improvement in data makes September liftoff a plausible thing for

the actual taper, when it happened in December of 2013, was a non-event because it market, but, accepted by market participants-so that no one took any inference recall that was in the market-not just in the literal sense of being predicted by the psychologically, it seemed about the Committee's objective function.

situation today with the first interest rate increase, the real story is the and accepted it, and I think threat market's understanding think we are reaching a point at which a 25 basis point increase wouldn't be that and would not have broad implications.  So my SEP path is for September liftoff with increase in December, 25 basis points each, and then averaging 25 basis points every If you look at the path forward.  And the market seems to have fully internalized that we are reaching a point at which a liftoff in the latter part of this year would really raise no to the market's understanding of a low path going forward.  Indeed, the is it will be lower than the Committee says by a substantial margin, albeit a diminishing one.  So I guess I important another other meeting, although I don't mean to imply that we should get on an escalator with equally spaced steps.

and surveys show an expectation that there is about a 40 percent feels about right to me.  I think the Committee's two raised by Governor Tarullo, I have been thinking about that and talking meaning a material diminution or diminishment of slack.  So, you know, a tenth really not enough.  You want to see slack coming out of the market in a material year.  We Both market readings chance of liftoff in September.  That conditions for liftoff, as set forth in the statement and amplified and sketched out in more detail by the Chair, are nearly fulfilled.  There has been further improvement in the labor market.  And to address the point about that as here and there is way, and I think that has been met with more than 200,000 in monthly job growth this

Signs that wages are increasing continue to accumulate gradually but steadily. measures are stable.  Longer-term breakevens have climbed above their lows of earlier this year as spot oil prices have increased.

well on the discussion that we had at the end of meeting.  Obviously, it is appropriate to try to avoid surprising the market, and I the market move in the next six or eight weeks to downgrade significantly due to incoming data.  If the data the Committee be able to keep its options open for I would add a couple of thoughts as yesterday's would not like to see the possibility of a September liftoff unless, of course, that is come in as expected, I would really like to see September.

And, by the way, neither economy has reached 3 percent growth since the would just say to that, 'No.  I don't think so.  I really don't.' But looking back at surprise to me, and I think generally to the Committee, the staff, and the world.  It surprising that it appears did the fiscal cliff, and neither did the government shutdown, all of which happened in 2013, with 2013 being the only year in which the crisis.

So what are the takeaways here?  First, it just is not possible to confidently predict the reaction of financial markets.  The markets will do what they clear that a little volatility or a 25 basis point or 50 basis point rate increase, even across the curve, will slow the United States economy down much.  It market economies, but I focus around the world on this that great CEO that I worked with for years used to always say, 'Control the controllable.' what the Committee controls is our decision, and, to a much smaller extent, our that decision.  And I think we ought to make that decision on the merits market reaction.  I wouldn't go so far as to say ignore the drive the Committee's decisions. A In this case, communication about and not worry excessively about the bond market, as some have, but I would not let it

I support the Committee's communications plan.  I like the idea of a separate staff did on the directive.  I think there is very little chance that an is echoed in the minutes dropped three mistaken for some signal about the either way.  So I would be happy to live Finally, note.  Frankly, I liked what the amended directive with just technical amendments that weeks after this press conference and this meeting would be path of policy.

value to think. MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you.  I support alternative B.  I believe there is watchful waiting while additional data help clarify the economy's underlying momentum.  This value is heightened by the asymmetry of risk-management considerations.  The combination of the statement and the SEP release conveys that approach nicely, I

the beginning of as yet unclear how strong or persistent the forces holding back stronger growth time suggest that slack remains, although the strength of job openings, the As I discussed yesterday, the pace of economic improvement slowed at the year, and it is are likely to be.  The labor force participation rate and the share of employees working part for economic reasons recent reacceleration in payrolls, and some hopeful signs on wages suggest slack is diminishing at a good pace.

turn of the year, core inflation remain stubbornly below our target, and not noticeably different from subpar pace of inflation over the recovery.  And the puzzling disconnect between it is important that reasonably robust in aggregate demand be maintained going forward to promote the further improvement liftoff. In contrast, although inflation has rebounded from the low levels at the measures of the average tepid aggregate growth and stronger labor market improvement complicates our task.  With remaining slack, and inflation persistently below our target, increases in labor market conditions and the movement of inflation back toward 2 percent that are our conditions for we have received so far on economic activity in the first half questions about the sufficiency of growth in demand and whether that growth will be more acute.  This raises the risk of market over the coming days and weeks. The totality of data that raises some maintained.  So I am not yet reasonably confident that we will soon achieve our targets. Moreover, uncertainty over Greek default is becoming disruptions

would like to build on something that more attractive to me-the more likely to be affected by balance sheet compared with September.  So if it is a close call, I would much prefer commence liftoff in December.  In my mind, a December sheet constraints would likely exert more of an effect at also might be easier for us to assemble for In considering a September liftoff versus later, I Governor Brainard brought up, a consideration that makes September fact that markets will be considerably thinner and constraints in December to move in September rather than liftoff would likely be sloppier because trading activity would be depressed.  Trading desks would be thinly staffed, and balance year-end than at other times.  Obviously, it

Well, I don't to lift off in a non-press-conference meeting, even though we've said that all So what about an October liftoff if we're not quite there in September? think there's anything wrong with October per se, but I think it's really unlikely that we're going to actually decide meetings are live.

lifting off at a press conference To lift off at a non-press-conference are unlikely to come in so oneat a press conference meeting at a non-press-conference meeting six or seven weeks later.  I think we just need to move in October. Why do I reach that conclusion?  As I see it, the bar to meeting is lower than at a non-press-conference meeting. meeting, you have to get sufficient news over the interval between the two meetings to get over that higher bar.  I just don't think that's very likely.  The data sided to push the motivation up sufficiently to transition from 'no' to 'yes' understand that it's highly unlikely we're going to a press conference for the October sends an awkward signal as well.  Why the lot of drama.  I if the liftoff doesn't seem to have a sense of urgency driving it. Now, obviously, you could decide to announce meeting and move in October, but I think this urgency?  What has changed that made September a no-go but October so necessary that you have to schedule a special press conference?  You want a smooth liftoff without a think it's better

is, yes, we can certainly lift off in a non-press-conference doubt it, and given that, I think the choice may come down to September December, hence my focus on the relative attractiveness of September versus December. So the bottom line for me meeting, but will we?  I or

C , I have a very favorable reaction to the way it has been done, separating the In terms of ′ monetary policy decision from the tactics of how to actually achieve it.  I think it's a stronger

But it is a very soft is, we 'currently anticipate that,' which can already be inferred from the rate at which we raise the federal funds rate might be gradual, we might raise it gradually, depending on how the economy or financial conditions evolve.  I worry a the statement, it could be taken as a stronger commitment than it we really want to raise the federal funds rate going to raise it gradually, so now we don't want to do 50 the bottom line for me is that I would slightly in the statement. and interest rates post liftoff?  This is a much tougher tantrum somewhat by underlining the fact that we think it commitment.  All it says the SEP.  And while not little bit that if we put that in actually is, or we could get to a meeting and say 50 basis points but we said we were basis points.  I think that would be unfortunate.
