MR. FISCHER.  So moved.

I President Lockhart has announced that he plans to step down from his position early next year, and this will be his last FOMC meeting. January on the evening of the first day of the FOMC meeting, which will opportunity to honor him appropriately and express our best wishes in a an FOMC meeting.

like to make just a few remarks today.  After a long and varied career in academia here and abroad, Dennis joined the Federal Reserve in March 2007 as the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.

the best in the Dennis, we thank you for your service to the Federal Reserve, and we wish you all next phase of your career.

MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  [Applause]

YELLEN.  Okay.  Let us turn to our agenda.  The first item pertains to 'Proposed Rules Regarding Availability of Information.'  You recently received a staff to the Committee's rules regarding the availability number of changes to relevant information availability policies by Approval of the staff proposal would align the Committee's FOIA rules with the CHAIR Revisions to memorandum that proposes certain revisions of information.  To summarize briefly, legislation passed earlier this year requires federal agencies to implement a December 27. new statutory requirements and would implement a number of additional changes, all of which are technical.

me ask:  Does anybody have any questions for the staff about the proposals?  [No that we now have a single vote on the proposal, and I'm going to explain exactly what it is that we will be requested to vote on. Let response]  Okay.  If not, I suggest to ask Brian encompass three sets of items are included on page 2 of the staff the heading 'Procedural Notes.'  First, the Committee would approve the regarding the availability of information.  A version of the rules is attached to the staff memo.  Second, the Committee that would allow the revised rules to be published in the as an immediately effective interim final rule under the Administrative Procedure Act. there is good cause that public notice and comment on 'impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.' MR. MADIGAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  This vote will items.  For your reference, I might note that these memorandum under adoption of the recommended changes to its rules tracked-changes would make two determinations Federal Register One, the Committee would determine that these amendments would be

December 13-14, 2016

there is good cause to waive the typical 30-day delay effective date of the rule.  The staff believes that these determinations are reasonable the necessary changes to the rules in a very the General Counsel to take the appropriate steps to reflect these changes in the rules and records submit the appropriate filings to the FOIA public liaison to fulfill the roles described Two, the Committee would determine that for the because, one, the act requires agencies to implement short time frame, and, two, the changes beyond those required by the act are technical in nature. Third, the Committee would authorize the Secretary in consultation with do two things:  one, to of the Committee and Federal Register, and, two, to appoint a Federal Reserve employee as the Committee's in the amended rules.

appendix 2 to the staff memo.  That notice is the proposal on which the is being asked to vote. A draft of the Federal Register notice, which includes a detailed description of the changes, was attached as Committee

YELLEN.  Okay.  Do I have a motion to approve the proposal? CHAIR

I just have an additional note.  Although the interim final rule will be Federal Register, the public will have 60 days comment period, the Committee will be asked, potentially at final either as is or with changes, if warranted by public comment, and to authorize publication of the final rule Federal Register. Thank you.

YELLEN.  Okay.  And let me next call on Simon. CHAIR

YELLEN.  Yes, this is a Board meeting as well.  We've already had a motion CHAIR and closed the Board meeting.

I was just checking. MR. POTTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

Yes.  We're now going to go to 'Financial Developments and Open Operations.' CHAIR YELLEN.

MR. POTTER.  It's a Board meeting as well?

The reduction in lending by U.S. prime money market funds to banks had already reduced U.S. dollar and other currencies increased.

MR. POTTER.  Yes.

There's also a figure in Tealbook B, and, for November sure if they lined up.  Is Because some of us are going to be eager months and very perceptive of you.  I also noticed that.  So, my reckoning is got 120 there.  I think there's a difference in definition and timing involved in that, right.  There is a bit of a difference. MR. POTTER.  That's 80; they've but you're

MR. LAUBACH.  I believe that in Tealbook B we are using our estimates of what we would show in the Quarterly Financial Report.

I see. MR. LACKER.

December 13-14, 2016

MR. POTTER.  So I'm just giving you right up to what the controllers and markets tell us on that day.

possible to circulate a little write-up of what the difference is? MR. LACKER.  Okay.  I don't expect someone to regurgitate the difference now, but would it be a question I raised this morning on the call. MR. POTTER.  We will do that, yes.  It's

of the operational-readiness longtime supporter of the Desk's operational readiness and participated in really glad to see the Desk taking a systematic approach to Desk's ability to conduct operations that it is currently authorized to conduct. MR. LACKER.  Second, I really appreciated the overview framework.  I'm a readiness preparations, and I'm ensuring the the readiness to asked to conduct, might not have ever conducted, and might was really curious about this.  First of all, there's an the highest readiness prioritization, and so you I want to commend you for that right off the bat. I was intrigued, however, by the memo's reference to the Desk assessing conduct operations that it may be not be authorized to conduct now.  I appendix that shows 26 operations that have engage in regular readiness preparations.  And I was really glad to see selling MBS was on that list.

MR. POTTER.  We are authorized to do those types of open market operations.

about see the other 32 listed anywhere.  These are things that you folks think talked about them here.  I don't know if any of us them.  So, actually, I'm really curious about them.  Does it take many use?  Have you ever discussed any of these with external in some far-flung market or MR. LACKER.  But you maintain a catalog of 58 operations, and you just told us 26 of them, and I didn't you need to be ready to do, but we haven't have even thought about resources to maintain some readiness for these things that we haven't even thought about doing? Have you assessed the likelihood of parties by way of researching what would be involved in operations

December 13-14, 2016

was wondering if you could make the list of 32 to the Committee at some point. in other-the imagination runs wild in this circumstance.  I available

You're right that the three categories that are listed here are the categories currently using resources, and that's why we focused on the three. operations that we didn't list, and they cover a wide variety of things, would be one of those; TSLF things that we may have done prelittle work on them but didn't do any real a wide variety of things, and we can certainly share that.  But are in those two categories today, and the purpose of MS. LOGAN. of operations in which we're There are about 30 other including things we did in the crisis.  Agency debt purchases Schedule 1 would be in that category.  They also include crisis-for example, options on repos that we did during Y2K would be one-and some things that we haven't done, such as municipal debt.  There may have been things that people asked us about during the crisis, and we may have done a operational work.  They include we're not using resources on the things that this is to show you the things in which we are.

MR. LACKER.  Okay.

We will be happy to share the full list. MR. POTTER.

things that the open market Desk is legally entitled MR. LACKER.  Great.  Are they all to do?

there is within the Federal Reserve Act.  For example, are agency debt sales, FX forwards, FX swaps with private counterparties, purchasing spec MS. LOGAN.  Yes, everything there pools instead of TBAs, or doing repos DVP instead of through the triparty system.

YELLEN.  Other questions?  President Kaplan. CHAIR

Treasury securities to meet of these redemptions? MR. KAPLAN.  Is it your sense that the Chinese are selling some

Yes, as they have been for quite a while. MR. POTTER.

POTTER.  Yes. MR.

MR. KAPLAN.  And that's continuing?

not explicit-that once the exchange reserves run low enough the Chinese might be these flows, such as a devaluation? MR. KAPLAN.  And then the second thing.  Do you think people are expecting-I know that it's thinking about taking some preemptive action to stem comment as well.  They still have more than $3 trillion account surplus.  So I don't think there's anything next week.  The this kept going for another 12 months, then that might show a bigger rundown the reserves.  Part of the fall in exchange reserves is due to the valuation effect, because they they're pricing in dollars, that moves it down.  Also, because they will also have market it, as the rates have gone up and the way they report is that way.  Steve. MR. POTTER.  So I'll let Steve in reserves and a current notion would be if in hold nondollar assets.  If previously sold quite a lot of short stuff in the intervention, their portfolio losses in

action, which is to tighten up actually an active debate within because once you lot of market participants expect more to follow. MR. KAMIN.  I think they've already taken one preemptive capital controls on outflows, and, meanwhile, I think there is China among different observers and policymakers over whether a preemptive large devaluation would help by delivering the devaluation people are worried about or hinder do one devaluation, a

MR. KAPLAN.  Right.

December 13-14, 2016

outstart with a deliberate devaluation.  So this is still up in the air.  Our is for neither a preemptive devaluation nor a very large and continuing depreciation. that a lot of the depreciation of the RMB against the dollar that we've seen is, more of other currency movements and is in line with one of their standard the basket of currencies, and, in that has continued.  So our forecast over the next few years is that they keep the RMB stable currencies, more or less, and as a result of that, you get a little bit more dollar. MR. KAMIN.

Our assessment is that unwound-we have penciled quarter.  This view is partly informed by the labor flows data.  As can be seen in panel 4, some of last month's decline in the unemployment rate in the think is into the labor force, the black line, has slowed over the past year or conditions have continued to tighten.  Nonetheless, exits the result of which has that it is not unusual for exits to fall faster than entries as the workers are the labor force as the expansion matures, perhaps In a longer view, the flows data on labor force entry and exit, shown in panel 5, indicate that entry so, even as labor market from the labor force, the red line, have slowed even more, been an improvement in participation over the past year.

This foreign output response has helped inform what we have built foreign outlook.  This effect operates through three channels.

Accordingly, as in past forecasts, we project the dollar to rise as markets are surprised by sensitivity of the dollar with respect to surprises 1 percent for a lot in recent years.  And thus the dollar could be stronger or weaker than we As we have indicated for some time, this dollar path could prove wrong for several reasons.  To begin with, the in monetary policy is quite uncertain.

However, this relationship has varied expect.

As shown by the red dot in panel following the election, the AFE index of the dollar rose rule of point widening of the the 1 percent rise from the rule of thumb is about the same as the increase in the dollar shown in our fiscal scenario on the previous slide.

One possibility is that markets share the staff's view on the size expansion, but the sensitivity of the dollar with respect to interest rates of thumb during the period.  In this case, assuming the package materializes, the dollar might well evolve as we markets are expecting a much package than we are assuming.  Indeed, in the alternative scenario with a the dollar appreciates about twice as much.

Could you explain your thinking about why overall the risks to the downside on GDP and the upside on unemployment? The second question was more of a surprised.

MR. WILLIAMS.  Yes, you are walking into agreement with me, which is probably what you want to run from here.

I thought I heard you just medium-term judgment about asymmetric risks, and I would have said the opposite-that my

We don't have one in the baseline. But we're talking about risks here.  And a recession in the next year or two, before the funds ability of the

In particular, the and Williams estimates are that the equilibrium real rate is, I think, in the neighborhood In the longer run, we now, having incorporated a more increase in the little bit greater scope for an easing of the stance than would be available today.

And so, as that process of equilibrium short rate unfolds, that will give a of monetary policy in the future, several years down the road, will find that the equilibrium real rate is actually low.  But, anyway, this is just a topic for further discussion. MR. WILLIAMS.  Well, my concern, obviously, is that that doesn't occur, right?  When we reduce our balance sheet and everything, we quite

CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman.

December 13-14, 2016

several questions, but first I wanted to build on President Williams said.  I guess my view of the risks to the forecast is that you have a and then you ask, where is the skew of the distribution?  It's not about where the relative to the funds rate.  So I guess I interpret the balance of the risks VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I have what modal forecast lower bound lies differently, I think, than you do.

thinking about to have before they put something in the Tealbook?  I mean, I in very distinct the third quarter.  What's the threshold for relative to deciding to put something in for trade barriers going up or we have when I think about the uncertainty associated with it, it's of magnitude, timing, and composition.  When does it get over the bar? rule?  I guess that's what I'm asking. I want to ask about two different things.  First of all, what's the staff's what level of knowledge they have was really struck by how the FOMC participants handled the fiscal uncertainty ways, yet the Tealbook put in 1 percent, starting in deciding to do that immigration policy being tightened?  I mean, how do you think about that?  Because this very specific fiscal forecast, and just enormous in terms What is the decision we decide to a modal forecast, so we need to write down something specific.  In this case felt that, in view of what had been said during the election campaign and as the Republicans the White House and the Congress, there seemed to be some appetite for doing likely.  There has long been talk about tax cuts.  The magnitude to what we built into the forecast.  I think that there is clearly MS. AARONSON.  Yes.  I think there are two issues.  One is, how do we make the decision to put something in?  And then what do we decide to put in?  Because once do something, it's we will control something, and we thought it was Republicans have been in favor of doing that, and it was something that Donald Trump campaigned on.  The House Republicans have had a plan that has been circulated, and it is actually pretty similar in

December 13-14, 2016

was under discussion to a sufficient degree that we they would move forward on this.  And, actually, this situation is George W. Bush came into office, their implementation a huge range of uncertainty.  But a tax cut thought it seemed likely that similar to what happened in the early 2000s when, even before the 2000 election, there was some talk about tax cuts.  And, actually, once moved forward pretty quickly.

bar is sort of:  That you're highly confident of VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So the direction.

MS. AARONSON.  Yes.

DUDLEY.  If you're reasonably confident of direction, then you're something in.  Is that a way to think about it? VICE CHAIRMAN going to put

MS. AARONSON.  I think so.  That's how I was thinking about our having moved in that direction.

Okay. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

Right. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

of some of the individual items-reopening to gauge that it was very hard there would be actions that would be macroeconomically meaningful, or might have microeconomic effects MR. KAMIN.  We expect that if there are going to be moves, they will be toward higher barriers of trade.  But the array of different possible actions that have been floated by the campaign were so disparate, and the magnitude NAFTA, declaring China a trade manipulator-were so difficult even to assess whether whether there would just be a series of disparate actions that

December 13-14, 2016

lot on the macro side.  So, for that reason, we chose not to assume trade but not amount to a policies in our baseline.

DUDLEY.  Look, I don't think there is a perfect choice here.  I think just really a hard choice.  I just wanted to understand the rationale. VICE CHAIRMAN it is

I'd just like to elaborate on one other aspect of how we made the MR. WILCOX. decision.

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Sure.

We had to make a decision to do something.  It was clear that financial MR. WILCOX. market participants made a judgment that something is likely to be in the offing.

Agreed. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

in front of the Committee a projection in which we had no fiscal adjustment. elaborate process of backing out, on the basis of financial the response that they had built in, in anticipation of a fiscal not putting in. MR. WILCOX.  I think it would have been reasonable, and, indeed, I contemplated seriously putting That would have required a more market quotes, some allowance for policy path that we were

Right. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

or less, a coincidence, not a design objective, that our analysts proposed to put in does seem to be in pretty good writing down, and that's documented memo that we sent to the Committee.  We look like we're in the middle of the pack of the analytical burden in constructing a coherent forecast that had one story to help the Committee in its thinking, we put a couple of MR. WILCOX.  Now, it really was, more that the fiscal package alignment with what most financial market participants are in the various people who were taking a swing at making some kind of judgment.  So to a degree I think that has eased our behind it.  But I would say that

December 13-14, 2016

in the 'Risks and Uncertainty' section, one with no fiscal package and one is, roughly speaking, twice as big.  The other percentage point's worth of GDP comes in the alternative scenarios that form of government spending rather than tax cuts.

DUDLEY.  No, I thought it was good to do.  I want to switch gears a I liked the memos on unemployment-rate undershooting.  The one thing they didn't get is this empirical regularity, at least for the United States, whose unemployment rate lot, and I think in the memo they talked about different about the staff's views that is just a statistical anomaly, because we haven't had that many business there's something dynamically going on in the economy when the unemployment to go up that generates those kinds of outcomes.  And the memos were silent on that VICE CHAIRMAN little bit. into, though, either goes up a little or it goes up a countries' experiences.  I think there was one country, Canada, for which it did go up 1 percentage point.  But why we see this empirical regularity that the unemployment either goes up a trivial amount, or by a lot, is interesting.  And I guess I'm still curious on that, whether cycles, or if rate starts one question.

A couple of years ago, the staff actually did send a memo to that empirical regularity.  And what it found was that those the Committee toMS. AARONSON.  Yes. the Committee on that, documenting episodes in which the unemployment rate did go up a lot were often associated with efforts on the part of

DUDLEY.  Make it so? VICE CHAIRMAN

-to make it so, to tame inflation.  And I will note that there were a of episodes-in particular, the mid-1990s-when the unemployment rate did come up a MS. AARONSON. couple bit.  But it came up slowly enough that it didn't trigger this particular stylized fact that you're referring to.

December 13-14, 2016

DUDLEY. Right. VICE CHAIRMAN

The stylized fact is something along the lines of, say, a three-month MS. AARONSON. moving average of the unemployment rate, because it's noisy, rises 0.4 percentage point.

DUDLEY. Or more. VICE CHAIRMAN

course of a quarter or two.  Actually, in the these soft landings, in fact, it was a soft landing from below, we thought was the natural rate then, did come up MS. AARONSON.  Yes, or more, over the mid-1990s, when we did find one of where the unemployment rate, relative to what a bit.

the economy does start into a the unemployment rate.  But I wouldn't say that I the memo precluded the possibility of these other rises.  Actually, in the late 1980s identified the interrupted soft landing, the gradually drifting up.  And we were kind of ambivalent about whether shock associated with the 1990 invasion of Clearly, we do think that there are some dynamics, once recession, that generate these rapid increases in thought that and early 1990s, the period for which we sort of unemployment rate was that would have ended in a recession, had not the Kuwait occurred.  But that's another case in which there is some evidence of it.

DUDLEY.  So, not to put words in your mouth-would you is that the way you are on VICE CHAIRMAN characterize yourself as believing, agnostic, not believing?  Agnostic, this issue?

the unemployment rate wouldMS. AARONSON.  About whether

DUDLEY.  Whether there's something there or just a statistical VICE CHAIRMAN artifact.

is something there, in the sense that I think when we a recession the unemployment rate goes up quickly, and that's often when you see it.  But I MS. AARONSON.  I think there enter

December 13-14, 2016

that many examples, but when we that many examples we identified in which the Committee actually it was trying to achieve a soft landing.  And so I think it's just a little unclear.  I don't regularity rules out the possibility that it can also go up don't think that that precludes the possibility that you can have those gradual increases.  I think we haven't seen that many of them because we don't have were looking, there weren't said that think the fact that we view this empirical gradually.

DUDLEY.  So to President Rosengren, don't despair.  [Laughter] YELLEN.  And with that, we turn the floor over to President Rosengren. VICE CHAIRMAN CHAIR

Wilcox's response to it.  When I look at the revisions to the projections broken out by fiscal assumption and no change in fiscal assumption, I see that the no change in fiscal is zero, minus 0.01, 0.01, and zero.  So, no change from the But we observe that the 10-year Treasury yield is 70 basis points higher.  Either to back out all the financial market in order to be able to come up with that forecast, or you have to be modeling a very monetary policy contraction because that would be the reason you don't have fiscal policy monetary policy change.  In effect, this would be modeling a MR. ROSENGREN.  I want to follow up on Vice Chairman Dudley's first question and David change in assumption for the real GDP previous time. you had to do the exercise that David talked about, which is movements severe changing-then, presumably, it's a very substantial monetary policy tightening with no change in GDP.

to be something that were used in the press conference, I think it would lead up with how people actually backed to changed expectations If this were to a lot of awkward questioning because you'd have to come out their expectation of how much the financial market reaction is due regarding fiscal policy.  That could generate a whole host of questions.  I don't know if you were planning on using this in the press conference.

December 13-14, 2016

YELLEN.  I wasn't planning on using this, but I was planning on, if asked about fiscal policy change and some didn't, and that when there were assumptions of a fiscal policy change, the changes in CHAIR the SEP, saying that some participants included a you could note that even the federal funds rate paths were modest.

in the 10-year Treasury yield that is not due to changed expectations long rate has gone up a lot.  So how do actual rates? MR. ROSENGREN.  But then, for those that didn't, you have to explain how you had a 70 basis point increase regarding fiscal policy.  I mean, you do observe that the you explain the way people actually came up with their assumption about no fiscal policy change using essentially a 25 basis point increase in the path, which to the effect of this fiscal policy package on rate.  Part of this occurs by term premiums that's consistent with the projections that you see reaction, but there is a lot of uncertainty and we don't know gone into that-maybe a larger fiscal package than the staff have CHAIR YELLEN.  And you have is, as I understand it, similarly r *, and a larger, I guess 40 basis point, move in the 10-year Treasury and part by moves in the funds rate.  I think here.  Now, there's a larger market what assumptions have penciled in here.

the market moves are going to be substantial.  And when we get MR. KASHKARI.  Just one quick response-and then I have a question-which is, I didn't necessarily assume that

markets may just reverse themselves.  So that wasn't a factor in my SEP more information, the submission.  And I put in no fiscal policy change.

was surprised that the was the most negative of all the scenarios.  The scenario that I worry one in which multiple banks get into trouble at the same time or a bank were to fail.  But to resolution.  And that alone was United States.  I wonder if you could expand on what Onto my question to the staff:  In the alternative scenarios, I banking crisis in Europe about is the scenario you picked was one bank doesn't fail and goes enough to trigger a negative scenario for the that, and explain that mechanism.  And then, how worried are you about this, in light of we're seeing in Italy and potentially what we're seeing in Germany?

Brian?  Unless you'd rather I respond. MR. KAMIN.

MR. DOYLE.  No, if you want to go ahead, please.  [Laughter]

this one.  First of all, just comparing the two international than the emerging market turmoil one, but not by a great deal.  And, as with most reflected in some sense what we put into the simulation, and the inputs included from the banking crisis in Europe spread out through the global advanced-economy banking MR. KAMIN.  I'll take alternative scenarios, the banking crisis one was, I think, marginally more consequential for U.S. variables simulations, that some downward pressure on U.S. confidence and spending and upward pressure on spreads, as the reverberations arising economy.  We assume that those will be greater in the case of this crisis than would be the case in the event of an emerging-market heightened-financial-stress situation.

issue of comparing the effect of one bank having a messy resolution banks, our view was that the scenario in which if a very large, very systemically important, one of the most Now, going to the with, let's say, some genuine bankruptcies of some smaller in question was one

Our sense is that even if that bank seems to be the most likely situation at present, it would take place without markets and the reverberation through a network of counterparties that a much larger and more systemically important bank. Now, you can tell a story in which a which is the current Italian bank holders being bailed in and to get their money out, which banking distress.

I mean, it we were to apply the standard that we would only build in effects that were deemed to be statistically significant, we'd in perspective what we can say model uncertainty and statistical MR. BULLARD.  I totally understand.  I just want to put about future fiscal policy in a realistic sense, in view of uncertainty, and I think the answer is 'not much, but we do the best we can.'

'Understanding Movements in the Dollar,' exhibit 6, if I'm reading the graph on the questioned this before.  We're saying that the dollar is going to world with more aggressive monetary policy than currently expects.  And yet when I look at panel 4-'Implied Federal Funds Rate Path'-in exhibit 1, I see that the market now expects a much higher federal funds rate pathSo it seems like if anything, on the that, we should be expecting less appreciation of the dollar, not more. On real dollar-panel 2-correctly, we're now assuming a bigger appreciation of the dollar.  We've talked about this before, and I've appreciate because we're going to surprise the it Mr. Potter's in fact, much closer to the Committee median-than before. basis of

In panel 2, if you look at those black solid and black dashed lines of the and previous forecasts of the broad dollar, most of the difference is the jumping off the higher dollar that we've already seen.  And I realize that it's almost those two lines you'll actually see that the solid line-the MR. DOYLE. current point-that is, imperceptible, but if you look at

December 13-14, 2016

market expectations and the staff's implied policy rate have come closer together.  There's less surprise built in, so this has a little bit.  But there's still some surprise.  And that gets you an upward forecasted line-is actually slightly flatter because path of the flattened out the path tilt.

And what I was referring to was the staff's regarding some point in time.  Is appreciation of the dollar because the Committee is going to rule-as opposed to the SEP path, which tells you what the Committee they're going to do. MR. BULLARD.  So it's the follow the Taylor (1999) participants actually think

That's what's implied in the staff projection. MR. DOYLE.

Isn't this a little bit off in comparison with what we should be doing? that are affecting the whole milieu of how we're future evolution of the international economy and the U.S. economy.  And all based on what you think the Committee is going to do versus what the Taylor rule says MR. BULLARD. I mean, you're projecting increases in the dollar going to look at the it's the Committee should do.

to present an forecast to you.  And it's one in which, basically, market expectations interact MR. KAMIN.  Well, arguably.  I mean, let's put it this way-our job is internally coherent

It sounds very and that's because it is. with monetary policy.  If we think that markets are going to respond to a that dollar should feed back to the circular,

of the variables to everything else, and what we deliver is MR. KAMIN.  And that's why, basically, we need to produce a forecast that takes into account all of the different reactions what happens after the market has settled down and we've converged in our projection to a consistent set of projections.

MR. BULLARD.  I guess another way to do it would be to take a market-based forecast of the dollar.

the IMF strategy, in terms of some of its as we changes in those monetary policies and their effect on the economy, market path for the dollar, which is invariant to our monetary policy, we're shutting down a transmission channel of monetary policy.  And that should lead, I a less reliable forecast of the economy, or at least one in which you would have to think the economy will be if the dollar is fixed according to the the dollar responds to monetary policy?'  In some sense, interpreting our forecast. MR. KAMIN.  We could do that.  I think that's projections.  We can do that.  That would mean that as we think about monetary policies go forward and consider then, by assuming a basically think, to more about, 'This is what the path of market path.  What will it be if we think it would make your job more complicated in

BULLARD.  I guess what I'd like to stress to the Committee is that, when we look exchange-rate forecasts, they are forecasts made on the basis of the Committee rule. MR. at these dollar actually following a Taylor (1999)

December 13-14, 2016

An inertial Taylor (1999) rule. MR. LAUBACH.

That particular line is just a line.  We have shown the Committee, I think fitted line has been historically and what it's been more line is steeper line.  If you go back historically, the line is shallower. a lot of uncertainty depending on the time period you choose to look at.

But I think that a part of the staff's forecast error that's to shocks that occur in the economy after the forecast is written is irrelevant to the with and without some assumed Perhaps some error in that estimation of that difference might be attributable to MR. LACKER.  President Bullard was inviting us to compare policy with attributable question of the difference between two alternative futures, intervention.

But, surely, the attributable whether this is within model uncertainty, President Lacker? That's a blank I mean, unless you actually calculate it with a certain set of models.  And I'm not MR.

In my forecast, the unemployment rate declines to 4.2 percent by natural rate of unemployment of 4.7 percent.  This occurs federal funds rate at this meeting and about four the forecast horizon.  If I took literally the fiscal policy as announced by the MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  There have been substantial changes in financial markets since our previous than 60 basis points, the dollar has appreciated, and the stock must admit, however, that despite all the excitement in election, my economic forecast has skepticism that fiscal and regulatory markets seem to be anticipating.  Like the Tealbook, I expect the economy to significantly overshoot 2019, well below my estimate of the despite my assumption of an increase in the more per year over

However, speed of adopting new fiscal policies and the uncertainty the magnitude of fiscal policies that will actually be passed by the Congress, I continue relatively gradual increase in the federal funds rate.  Should my skepticism prove incoming Administration, it would call reflecting my skepticism about the regarding to assume a wrong, we will need to tighten more quickly.

the overshooting of full employment in my forecast, I was quite interested in staff memos discussing earlier periods of overshooting.

Instead of debating whether to include one group or as part of the labor force, they let the data do the talking.  They developed an alternative market slack that scales all members of the population by the historical relative interesting insight of this work-and President Lacker has that if you look at the job-finding rates of the marginally labor force-people out of the labor force but who would like to work-their jobare basically the same as the long-term unemployed.  We've had a lot of debates I think the right answer to this is there is lot of these groups actually move back and forth Let me conclude with some additional comments about labor markets.  Despite unemployment rate that is at the lowest level since 2007, there remains concern to wring out every pocket of labor market slack.  There's been extensive Federal Reserve System over the past assess the degree of slack.

in assessing labor market slack, I'd be interested if geography is an important for this discussion.  For example, as I looked at states in my own District, the has never really recovered since the crisis-it's lower, but well above pre-crisis levels.  For this particular geography, I see the complex.  For a state like Oklahoma, the unemployment rate increased a shock-namely, to in labor and capital.  I see this shock as largely examples highlight the difficulty of gauging overall slack, as faces a different set of issues. First, aspect unemployment rate in New Mexico only modestly, and still issues as structural and full percentage point over the past year.  The issue here reflects a sectoral energy-which has resulted in some reallocation cyclical and unlikely to generate longer-term structural issues.  Finally, Colorado's unemployment rate remains near historically low levels and likely below its state-specific natural rate of unemployment.  These three each local labor market memos goes back to a question from our previous meeting in undershooting the natural rate of employment.  Here, I found the memos did not necessarily diminish my own concerns about this it poses risks, it has uncertain benefits, and, even as policy is calibrated to a soft landing, it requires, as Governor Tarullo and the staff noted, a bit of luck.

The toward our objectives since the November unemployment rate has declined; support continued further tightening in labor markets and progress toward 2 percent inflation.

report confirms that the labor market continues to tighten, albeit at a pace than over the past few years.  Over the past 12 months, the unemployment rate has an average annual rate of 0.9 percentage preceding four years, which reflects both a welcome outperformance of labor relative to trend as well as a slower pace of job creation.  We are seeing rising at 4.6 percent is now a bit below most the natural rate and seems to be on a path to reach the low 4s.  There is some increase. The November jobs slower now declined 0.4 percentage point compared with points over the force participation real wages and improving job prospects.  Surveys indicate that households are finally seeing jobs as plentiful, and firms are finding it harder to fill positions-results that have typically been seen at or above full employment.  The unemployment rate estimates of evidence now of emerging supply-side constraints, particularly in surveys of jobs hard to get and hard to fill.  On the other hand, wages and compensation more broadly have yet to show more than a gradual halting finds limited highly The interesting and excellent staff memo on undershooting the natural rate evidence on the question of whether such an undershooting should be expected to have persistent or even permanent positive supply-side effects.  The evidence is limited for one

That the unique characteristics of this cycle. reason:  Because undershoots are rare. unemployment can have adverse supply-side effects as workers lose skills and attachment to labor force. The exact uncertainty is even higher than usual, in view of growth is barely above trend, and wage we have time and space to allow the unemployment rate to decline a bit 'behind the curve.'  I assume that this will be happening of a rising policy rate and gradually tightening financial conditions.  There will be inflation.  A modest undershoot So, as long as inflation is below target, economic increases are moderate, further without too much risk of getting in a context time to react if we see upside surprises in economic growth or will also help ensure that inflation does move up to our 2 percent target.

The section of the undershooting memo addressing the Phillips curve was quite interesting in this regard.

All told, the move inflation expectations are well anchored. The recent increase in market-based measures of inflation compensation is a welcome development.  Expectations remain below our target of 2 percent after accounting for the wedge between CPI and PCE inflation.  In addition, these readings early 2014 or during a pre-crisis period when inflation was close to our up in inflation compensation supports confidence that

The pace of business investment remains a concern, as nonresidential investment contributing to the poor to take a more accommodative turn, and I find the staff's of a hypothetical tax cut amounting to 1 percent of GDP to be a reasonable initiative of that nature would, at a minimum, provide a near-term downside risks, including weak economic growth, low inflation, and I did assume such a tax cut in my baseline, but I didn't take it into real as an insurance policy or a reason for greater confidence in the baseline.

The short answer to the that we will The question I am getting a lot in a regime this is 'maybe,' and we are treating this as an upside risk in our regime-based forecast for time being.  On this, I agree with President Lockhart and others.  It's possible

December 13-14, 2016

U.S. macroeconomic prospects in the become convinced that true change has occurred for quarters and years ahead, but it's too early to reach such a conclusion today.

Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis's regime-based approach has two key The low-growth, low-real-rate regime we are currently in is characterized by a low real interest rates very low and, by extension, the very low.  Is either one of these factors likely to switch to a high value 'Maybe, but not yet.' The components: rate of productivity growth and by a high liquidity premium on short-term government debt. Both of these factors are working to keep safe appropriate policy rate during the forecast horizon?  The answer is:

my thinking, I can divide nonmonetary policy into five very broad areas of may occur.  One is deregulation, broadly defined.  Two is tax changes, especially to business taxes, including repatriation of cash stored overseas and changes in infrastructure spending; four, trade; and, five, immigration.  Of these effect on the medium-term growth rate of the U.S. would not conceive of these initiatives as stimulus but, rather, as an attempt to trend growth rate of the U.S. economy. To organize change that with respect corporate tax rates.  Three, five categories, in my opinion, the first three executed properly could conceivably affect medium-term productivity and have some economy.  I increase the think an argument can be made for deregulation if you think that the regulatory has swung too far in recent years.  However, it's a broad area.  It would apply across that would affect business, and it's difficult to gauge.  I think tax changes, to the extent that they could influence investment in the United States, might through that channel. a long time, but in principle you'd like to have the right So these I pendulum many different types of activity that have some effect on medium-term productivity and might have an effect Infrastructure spending tends to take amount of public capital in place.  This could also improve medium-term productivity.

final two areas, perhaps more important during the election, are, in my opinion, on trade, I would cite the Canadato change trade retaliation from the other side, and it tends to be The slow-moving issues:  trade and immigration.

For the purposes that are the Also, I think that the effects from any policy changes that may be upcoming are more likely to be seen in 2018 and 2019 and much less in 2017.  Sitting here today at the end of 2016, I our near-term outlook has not changed very much.

there would be some near-term effects, but I think they're less likely. the equity market rally, which was proceeding apace again the corporate tax changes, which by would have a large effect on revaluating the U.S. corporate sector and not so much the possible policy changes ahead, even though It is possible that One thing that people might cite is this morning when I was watching TV.

The bottom line is that the St. Louis Federal the baseline outlook essentially unchanged over the forecast horizon.

You are talking about yields in a can really break out of the global context all by increase in the 10-year yield was inflation expectations.  The a real yield.  I agree with Governor Powell and President Evans that the increase was a welcome development.

That's good from our point of view. because we were assuming that they were going to bounce On the changes in yields since the election, agree with President Williams's global context.

That markets expected at the time of a gradual pace of coming year-two rate hikes-compared with expectations for following the initial increase in the funds rate in June 2004. The black line in the panel to the right presents of tightening over the year starting tomorrow on the basis of adjusted for noticeably following the elections and now stand just short of roughly matches the pace of tightening over 2016 that last December's meeting.  Then, as now, expectations are for tightening over the eight hikes over the year how market participants' views federal funds rate over the next two years have meeting.  As is the case for the responses the Desk surveys that Simon discussed earlier, the market-based probability funds rate at the end of 2017 has shifted to the right. in the middle-right panel indicates that uncertainty about the level of the further out has increased, suggesting that investors' views about for fiscal policy cover a of possibilities, and we have only a rough idea of what assumptions about The middle two panels offer some perspective on about potential outcomes for the changed since the time of your November from distribution for the level of the The red line federal funds rate outcomes for the economy-likely including, but not limited to, fiscal policy outcomes-have become more diffuse.

This policy calls for a somewhat faster pace of tightening staff's baseline assumption.  For comparison, the dashed green line plots the the optimal control simulation using the October staff projection as the between the two lines shows the additional tightening that keeping the unemployment rate and inflation on roughly the The federal funds rate in the current staff projection as the baseline is at the end of 2017-36 basis points above the rate in the optimal control 'No Fiscal Stimulus' scenario.  By 2020, when the funds rate is about 1 percentage point above the 'No Fiscal Stimulus' An alternative scenario in the 'Risks and Uncertainty' section of Tealbook A provided one perspective on this question.  The bottom-left panel looks at the same question through the lens of the optimal control exercises Tealbook B.  There, we responses to fiscal scenarios under different policymaker strategies.

As mentioned in Tealbook B, the number the Tealbook closed, we recorded in Tealbook B. MR. LAUBACH.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  President Lacker asked yesterday about the consistency between the staff's estimate of the unrealized portfolio at the end of November, which was reported on page 57 of Tealbook B as $121 billion, and the data reported there was a preliminary estimate.  And, in the period since have received new data that show that the unrealized gain position at the end of November was $81 billion-$40 billion lower than the preliminary estimate

MR. LACKER.  Great.  Thanks, I appreciate that.

MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support an increase in the funds rate and alternative B.  I expect that'll be path of policy.  The current draft of the federal funds rate.  I continue to

I applaud inclusion of the prescriptions in the handout yesterday and hope we can include Taylor rule such as appear in the Tealbook, in the Congress next funds rate target at a points a year is unlikely to close the gap at a satisfactory For some time now, I've argued that we should pay heed to the fact that benchmarks Taylor rule calculations, Monetary Policy Report to the time we draft that.  Those benchmarks continue to rise, and increasing the pace as gradual as two or three quarter rate, in my view.

little doubt we're at full employment, and, as a result, I think it's increasingly of tightening.  This argument is reinforced by the memo on only domestic episode featuring landing, the FOMC raised the funds rate 300 basis points.  The four previous undershoots historical record resulted in inflation increasing, sometimes quite sharply.  I think it's the 1994 episode has been identified as the first instance of preemptive rate Another factor establishing our credibility in 1994, arguably, was that the new time chose to respect the Fed's monetary policy independence.  This was Administrations, going back to Lyndon to adopt more policies. There's important for us to pick up the pace unemployment-rate undershooting.  As I noted yesterday, in the a soft in the noteworthy that increases.

There has marked up its expected higher real interest rates, are clearly warranted, then our estimates of There's no question was some discussion of that yesterday.  Indeed, in the Tealbook, the staff assumed path of r *.  And if the fiscal policy outlook leads to which I think r * should increase.  That implies we'll have an even larger policy gap to close over time, so we will need to move even more rapidly.

movement in market readings on future inflation also argues for less Of course, these market reactions aren't independent of anticipated fiscal our expectation that rate increases would be only gradual was grounded in part on sense that the downside risks were moved up over the course of the year, and, since the election, there's been financial market measures of expected inflation.  As I noted yesterday, from options and term premiums indicates that investors believe the downside risks to diminishing and the risks to the upside are becoming more salient.  It's as if the 'coming about,' to use a nautical term. The post-election gradual rate increases. policy.  But low readings on inflation and inflation expectations and the elevated.  Inflation has a significant increase in evidence inflation are inflation outlook is in the process of in our policy rate suggestion that we start So I think a strong case can be made that we may soon need increases that do not qualify as gradual.  And, if so, I support President Williams's thinking about how to back away from the 'gradual' language in our statement.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I favor alternative B.  As I tried yesterday, my views on labor markets have evolved over the what I've seen happening in labor markets.  I think a number of metrics assessed individuallyand, certainly, labor process of removing slack.  I think some slack probably does remain in the labor even think will appropriately continue little less certain about the inflation target.  My SEP actually doesn't get to are on the upside.  So I should say that I'm not today going along I actually am convinced that this is the right policy move. I'm a 2 percent during the course of the next four years.  But, as I indicated yesterday, conditional on that projection, I think the risks reluctantly.

for now, a continued posture of gradualism is the right for us to take.  Continuing considerations include the fact that we are still relatively the effective lower bound.  And, as many of us have been saying for some time now, the the tools available to us pushes me a little bit, at least, toward being likelihood of a recession me to present more problems. As we go forward, I think that, position close to resulting asymmetry in cautious about rate increases, because anything that would increase the seems to external risks, I think President Williams said yesterday that there are some upside internationally, with a prospect of somewhat better economic growth in some countries. upside risks, if they are realized.

I don't think it supports conclusions in the risks of overshooting are high, and that we have to move in a With respect to the reading of that memo suggests only two strong conclusions: circumstances; and, second, it depends a lot on the luck of way.  And I would have loved to have drawn the 10 months ago.  I don't other direction, either-that the very strong preemptive fashion.

all of that, I do think the decisions we'll have before us could get more While the lower-bound and external risk considerations may remain, we a continued tightening of labor markets and may see some pickup in inflation, which internal considerations of the economy as we're currently observing it, might counsel rate increases.

Today the unemployment rate has already reached most estimates of the natural rate, with monetary policy.

This could help the public interpret the easier to explain changes in the SEP at the press conference. some measure of uncertainty, as the subcommittee on communications in its recent memo, might also be helpful. As we look to our policy choices next year, the risk that a policy could necessitate a faster-than-expected pace of policy tightening warrants consideration in two ways, I think.

Financial markets are expecting an rates and have essentially priced in a removal of policy accommodation. MR. HARKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Reflecting essentially, no slack in the labor closer increase in language, I worry that markets have come to interpret as meaning one or perhaps two rate hikes per year.  A look at the federal funds futures policy, as others have said.

Indeed, the issue has been that the market has been the public's new interpretation of one hike per year, as we did for the past two years, then the path we anticipate is no As I said, I do think there are rather than later.  Like some others, I think we do need to find a way to step back from the 'gradual path' normalization started, we didn't from mid-2004 to mid-2006.

I'll now several areas as radically as promised during the election campaign, we will, in retrospect, view today's approach to making monetary policy in a setting of much greater nonmonetary policy uncertainty than we've appropriate for the current and the public expect.  The argument can be put very We may The decision to raise the federal funds rate 25 basis points is state of the economy and in light of policy decisions and statements we've made in the period leading up to this meeting.  And yesterday's discussion made a compelling case for implementing the decision that the markets simply:  Both inflation and unemployment are very close to their dual-mandate targets. be somewhat overshooting, by which I mean undershooting the natural rate of unemployment, and we expect very gradually to reach our 2 percent PCE inflation target.

it was clear yesterday that most of us believe there is a serious risk we might Well, this decision, but we need also to send signals about future FOMC policy. that our monetary made with the goal of achieving and maintaining the dual mandate. easy to say, but it's not sufficient guidance to spell out the path that we expect the to follow. Further, overshoot both targets, and that the time has therefore come to raise the federal funds rate. that's it with respect to At the certainty of repeating myself, the main message we need to send is policy decisions will be Well, that's federal funds rate rich choice among alternative policies, so let me highlight a few of 'Monetary Policy Strategies' section of Tealbook B and ask a few projection shows large interest rates by 2022.  These changes make much less difference to inflation in the Tealbook B gives us a the results shown in the questions.  First, in terms of the charts on page 2 of Tealbook B, the staff changes in

There remains flat even as an important request. next two years than they do over the was an appeal yesterday for further work on whether the Phillips curve unemployment falls very low, and that is fiscal policy, which also means that the The simple a much greater effect than they do on inflation, in accordance with the way a Keynesian model Second, the GDP gap seems quite sensitive to staff projection is very Keynesian.  Well, that follows from the flat Phillips curve. policy rule simulations on page 4 show that the different policy rules have on unemployment works.

interest rate paths shown for five years out. from now, we'll have moved on to a new set of projections.  That means using the staff's projections mainly for interest rates in the relatively near future.  Or five years out make much difference to what we do today? Third, we do not, in practice, follow the Starting three months we must be am I wrong, and do the projections real federal funds rate.  In the second bullet point on page 3, the staff draws attention the fact that, at 1.16 percent, FRB/US of the real federal the projection that it takes to get the output gap to zero.  The of the real federal funds rate in the 12 quarters is 10 basis points.  That's quite a are certainly some interest rates on that path that are well below that-that we really aren't planning on or should real funds rate around a lot more than we think we should?  A question. Fourth, I was struck by the box on page 2, which shows the projected medium-term equilibrium to r * is well above the average level funds rate in the 12 quarters of average level large difference, because there 10 basis points.

recent election will alter the current regime, and low real rates on paper globally, the so-called r†.  Several people said they were disappointed in me r†, so I've sprinkled it throughout this commentary. The fact that we're not really leaving a regime, at least so far, may mean that the should remain fairly low over the forecast horizon.  That continues to be our information we have today. There's not much evidence so far that the which is characterized by low productivity growth in the United States government yesterday because I didn't mention [Laughter] policy rate projection, based on the

Many expectations of faster economic growth.  I think that's the think it's reflecting expectations of lower corporate tax rates, which, all U.S. corporate sector.  And if you look at of economic growth, a few people have marked them up, but most people have them we have for the St. Louis Federal Reserve forecast.  So, as that a regime change is in the offing.  The list of possible policy changes just rattled off much different economy in the future. There has been some change since the election-in particular, a major equity rally. are interpreting that as reflecting wrong interpretation.  I by themselves, would lead to revaluation of the projections still around 2 percent, which is what of today, I don't see the equity rally, so far, as reflecting changing fundamentals.  However, it is possible by President Kaplan is astonishing, and it could mean a So, obviously, I'll be watching this very closely.

All of think we just don't know at this point. To get the regime change, we would need higher And, as I was saying yesterday, a case could be made that some of will affect medium-term productivity there; possibly tax changes-if they productivity; and possibly infrastructure programs.  All of these also could go the other way and be detrimental.  So I

December 13-14, 2016

think the way a lot of people are talking about fiscal policy around the is not the way I would think about it.  Temporary increases in real GDP driven by higher spending, which is backed by future taxes, would be insufficient to change a regime, New Keynesian model, which often informs a lot of the thinking here, would have no role to play at all.  Those interested in my views on this out an essay I wrote a few years ago called 'Death of a Theory.' I will say that I table government in my view.  In a standard fiscal policy of that type could check the very large liquidity premium on paper globally was to lessen over the forecast horizon.  So-called r† would rise then, a higher policy rate for this Committee.  And, indeed, since the 10-year yield has increased substantially.  Some of this was inflation expectations. hoping for a has been in change, but somewhat higher real rate.  Accordingly, we now have one policy-rate increase in 2017, on forecast. Another way the regime could be altered would be if government and that would rationalize election, the As I explained yesterday, at the St. Louis Bank we were already expecting or maybe bounceback in market-based measures of inflation expectations.  So, seeing that actually happen was gratifying but didn't change our outlook.  The rest of the increase in the 10-year the real rate, and we did take some of this on board in our forecast.  It's not a regime it is a top of today's increase.  And, indeed, that's the only increase for the forecast horizon as we sit here today, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve

make three further comments, Madam Chair.  I see today's decision as likely to be are indicating three increases in 2017, whereas markets two.  I see it as somewhat above current market expectations.  I am concerned that think that the Committee is more hawkish than it I would prefer to stress that we will react to market circumstances and raise rates faster, it will be because there's good news coming in on the I'll interpreted as hawkish, because the dots have that at markets get ahead of themselves and start to probably really is. incoming data.  If we do

December 13-14, 2016

just because we decided all of a sudden to raise rates faster.  So I think in emphasize. U.S. economy and not the period ahead that's an important point to the balance sheet as a policy move that we should in the near future.  This is obviously not reflected in my rate path projection, but this mild tightening move without altering the policy rate path.  This that has been pushed to the back burner and should come back on the table.  As later.  I now think that we should reconsider a policy move that direction.  Another possibility would be to reallocate toward shorter-term ago.  I think I see allowing some minor runoff in consider would be another way to make a is something some of you remember, I was actually an advocate of allowing runoff of the balance sheet first and then raising the policy rate would go in this securities when we reinvest and undo the twist operation that was done several years that's something that we could consider in the near future, possibly during 2017.

that we not use the rhetoric about running the economy hot.  Maybe it's of how I think about macroeconomics, but, to me, it suggests departing from planned to real data that are coming in on the economy and that we're the policy rate according to that.  And even if we don't write a policy rule down, we have rule in mind that might have many more factors in it than the typical policy rules that are research literature.  But once you have that rule in mind, you would not arbitrarily to try to achieve some outcome, because the reason you chose the rule in my preference would be to the rhetoric about running hot.  Thank you, Madam Chair. Finally, I prefer just a sense policy or departing from an existing policy rule.  It sounds discretionary.  I think we should emphasize that we're reacting setting a policy studied in the depart from that rule the first place is, you think that's the optimal policy.  So I think that retire

So if we do get significant fiscal stimulus in the years ahead, in my mind, this would bring the reinvestment decision potentially much closer in terms of time, lower the might get to it really is time for the staff and the Committee to start to do the prep work on of issues here-tapering versus to treat MBS versus Treasury securities, et cetera.  So that, having this conversation maybe by the middle year. So I think how we might actually end reinvestment.  There are a lot stopping, how long a taper should be, how I think I would very much encourage the staff to get going on this, because I can imagine under a feasible set of circumstances, we could be of next

their views on, how do we match the of ending reinvestment or tapering reinvestment with federal funds rate changeswith any it's not just the decision to change the reinvestment path.  It's also the one similar to the regime shift that we ago.  But we still need to have a rough estimate so we can figure out how we should I also encourage the staff in this work to give us equivalence say, some sort of notion of equivalency?  I know that's going to be very difficult to do great precision, because fact that this is viewed as another major regime shift, made a year trade off these two things?

because we have plenty of time, I've been thinking a lot about and what we should think about it.  I'm very much in the camp of thinking the generally free labor of goods and services in the global economy has been hugely people, in lifting them out of poverty.  But, at the same the United States that have in the labor share of income over the past 20 or 30 years. income distribution, and we've had poor income mobility. four things together, there are a lot of people who actually haven't benefited Finally, before I conclude, the election outcome that beneficial to hundreds of millions of time, I think the election result shows that there are a lot of people in been left behind by globalization.  We've had weak productivity growth, so the pie is not growing very fast.  We've had a decline We've had an increase in the skew of When you put those from globalization.

And I think we need to talk about them a little globalization, the support for globalization and for trade is going to fracture-maybe it already

fracture-and, with that, we'll lose a lot, I think, as a country and a society.  So I think something that we collectively need to talk about. starting to it's

Raj Chetty and a whole bunch of other authors published a paper last week I think is really interesting.  Basically, what they did is, they looked at how the year of your your likelihood of earning more than your parents, based on the income decile of that if you were born in 1940, your chances of doing better chances of outdoing your parents decline markedly.  So, for example, if you were like you're not going to do as well as your parents if your parents were at income distribution.  I really encourage you to look at this paper.  I think it's very interesting empirical work, but it also underscores a little bit what we just saw in of the election outcome. In this vein, that birth affects your parents.  What they found is than your parents were really good.  But as you move down the cohorts from 1940, '50, '60, '70, and '80, the born in 1980, it looks 50 percent of the really terms terrific colleague on this Committee.  It just of this Committee benefits all of us-your background as a banker and as a colleague.  You're a very with.

a question?  Bill, I think there's an important question globalization. MR. FISCHER.  Could I raise about whether it's globalization or modernization that lies behind what's happened to relative incomes.  And I'm not sure that it's

December 13-14, 2016

are a lot of factors.  I'm using that as a that it's more complicated than that.  But, clearly, the support for really in danger, and I guess that's why I emphasize the VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think there shorthand, so I don't disagree globalization in the United States is globalization aspect of it.

the effect of the signal that we are starting to We know how much of an addition to the supply of assets the market has to absorb.  But we're also sending a signal, which is, we think the economy is MR. FISCHER.  And, second, what will be roll off the portfolio, just by itself? that strong enough to enable us to do this.  That'll reduce the effect to some extent, won't it?

DUDLEY.  I think the market would take it as a judgment that we're economy has sufficient momentum that we're not going to go back to the very near future.  Our original motivation for not ending the a little bit of room away from the lower bound, and we we weren't going to go back to the lower bound in the very VICE CHAIRMAN more confident that the effective lower bound in the reinvestment was, we wanted to get wanted to have some confidence that short run.

Right. MR. FISCHER.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Now, I did written, but you and make sure I understood it properly.  At President Mester, please correct me if I didn't get this changing the words where it says 'but still the 'considerably' in there.  So, basically, just add a MS. MESTER.  Yes.  And leave word, as opposed to changing it.

MS. MESTER.  Yes.

YELLEN.  You would be taking the old sentence and just adding the word 'Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved CHAIR 'considerably,' so it would read up considerably but remain low.'

DUDLEY.  I don't think this is a big deal one way or the other, but I that, on the one hand, you're moving.  On the other hand, you're saying something is remaining, and that little bit in opposition to one another. VICE CHAIRMAN guess when I originally thought about this question, I thought saying something is seems a

Oh, I thought they were synonyms, but I defer. MS. MESTER.

DUDLEY. And that's why I was more in the camp of 'still are way it's written now, because if you say something has moved and then was it at rest, or is it moving?  It just seems a little contradictory. VICE CHAIRMAN low.'  I guess I favor the say something remains, and 'still are' as synonyms, but I'm happy to defer leave it the way it is. MS. MESTER.  I think of 'remain' and

there strong views about this? DUDLEY.  I don't think it matters. CHAIR YELLEN.  Are VICE CHAIRMAN

CHAIR YELLEN.  Should we leave it the way it is then?  Okay.
