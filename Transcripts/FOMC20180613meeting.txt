Looking at the expectations in the Desk survey, roughly one-third of respondents the median dot to show four hikes this year.

This Using our survey data since last May, the bottom-left panel decomposes the difference between the year-end 2019.

However, there uncertainty regarding these projections because MBS principal payments are highly dependent upon long-term interest rates and various other factors. projections result from different model specifications.  For example, ahead of the June reinvestment period, our models had forecast MBS principal payments to total about $17.7 billion billion.

talking with market participants, is that the plan that's been hasn't fully been priced in to that MBS spread, that we're somewhere less than 20 basis points as yet.  So I suspect that there's still some room to go even under the likely be some further changing the distribution of potential outcomes, if interest rates were to fall.  So you're putting more of that convexity risk back to It's hard to know what the order of magnitude of that would be, but I would expect My sense, on the basis of announced so far that full current plan.  I think if you were to announce an adjustment, there would widening in that MBS spread, because you're particularly the market. some amount of widening.

It's not a surprise that we're projecting we'll be under the cap.

Governor Quarles. CHAIRMAN POWELL.

MR. QUARLES.  Somewhat related to President Rosengren's question, with regard to the small-value monthly purchases, just to keep the pipes clear-how will you know when that's

June 12-13, 2018

I mean, will it be a Potter Stewart situation-you know it when you see it? no longer need to do this? no longer necessary? Or is there a test that would allow you to say, we is that we'll learn something from doing those readiness tests over time, and we'll be able to change the amount so that we're not continuing to progress well, we can lower that amount or doing that, or not do it every month.  So I think we'll be able to come Committee after the first couple of months and say whether continuing would be MS. LOGAN.  I think our sense operational doing as much.  And if things are potentially even remove back to the needed.

think the risk of needing to reinvest again is likely to be the highest around the summer when the prepays tend to rise.  The summer might be another good that would be another good opportunity to reconsider that small-value test. I months, because that's opportunity to revisit that question, because if we don't see those reinvestments in the summer in 2019, I think reestimation of the size of the reserves become scarce is pretty big.  I wonder, can you elaborate on that CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I have questions.  Lorie, this balance sheet at which a little more.  I think you said it had to do with the fact that IOER was trading closer to RRP. What do you think's going on?

there were only a handful of respondents who One was federal funds rate moving higher in the range may have sparked thoughts that the that are needed may be larger, or that the discussion of the perhaps even that the long-run framework discussions they've been MS. LOGAN.  In the survey we asked the respondents to describe both their assumptions and what might have driven those changes, but provided clear answers.  And the clear answers that we got were the two that I noted. just that the amount of reserves in the system technical adjustment, or hearing may have influenced that.  But I would be skeptical, because it was only a couple of

respect to the actual qualitative responses, it was very small.  If we had to infer actual facts not being obtainable from the survey-my there were a number of strategists who did more detailed analysis over this and the intermeeting period, and it could be some sort of echo effect, in which people have read have consequently started to change or inform With what may also be driving things-with sense is that previous those analyses by some notable strategists and their thinking.

think another possibility is, as we've talked more about what the floor system might may be required, and maybe they hadn't that earlier last year.  But those are just guesses based on what we're seeing; we that I described. I look like, they've thought about what type of buffer thought about didn't see it in the survey results

Let me just add that this doesn't necessarily mean reserves are scarce at given in that survey, because if it's a floor system, reserves wouldn't be MR. POTTER. the number they are scarce.

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Right.  Understood.

June 12-13, 2018

DUDLEY. Part of this issue is that this was never very well nailed much excess reserves you're going to need in the system to keep the federal funds you want it to trade.  So any new piece of information can perturb that in ways that we don't fully appreciate.  So I would imagine that to move around as we get little pieces of information that inform because we're starting with a pretty broad range of possible outcomes. VICE CHAIRMAN down, how rate trading where expectation quite a bit, because no one really actually knows.  And I think the thing that makes it so hard to know is, we have a new set of regulations with respect to liquidity that may have altered the demand for reserves this is going to continue people's judgment, just that in the width of the expectations.  It's a very wide set MS. LOGAN.  And you can see for those numbers.

Brainard. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Governor

Yes.  Just further on that point, I've certainly heard a variety of perhaps we had anticipated.  Do you have any way of assessing whether true? MS. BRAINARD. market participants suggesting that perhaps supervised entities are likely to keep more of their HQLA in reserves than that hypothesis is started some systematic outreach to the banks, and we've done that notes written by the supervisors.  And of the 18 banks sense of what they see as their minimum cash amounts.  In to maintain that level of reserves. MS. LOGAN.  We've through interviews and also on the basis of that we've looked at, we've gotten a other words, what amount they would pay out

learned something from that.  I think that the regulations have changed the because of an explicit piece of the regulation, because of an implicit sense of the regulation-for example, whether they can And we've way they think about holding reserves-maybe not but maybe monetize the other HQLA, which, of course, you wouldn't have to with reserves.

that we've talked to, another thing that I think that is affecting of it is intraday payments.  In the case of those large institutions that may be dealing with a a firm like that would be asking for a much larger In the case of the banks some large payment flows, they think about the need for holding reserves relative to those payments lot differently than they did pre-crisis.  So minimum level of reserves.

is definitely true that the supervisory structure has affected the way that may be influencing some of these numbers as well. I think that it banks will be thinking about reserves, and market participants are starting to add those numbers up, and that the May meeting.  Do I CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Thanks.  Further questions?

Core PCE inflation is projected to edge up from 1.9 percent this which, as shown to the left, is a bit above our estimate of shown in red to the the further tightening of resource utilization that more from a projected deceleration in core import prices (in green).  Core inflation in 2020 also includes a small boost resulting from our assumed supply constraints.

compare the bars, PCE price inflation this year has been marked up December but is little changed for the period ahead.  And to the right, the this year mainly reflects higher energy prices and a slightly PCE projection; 2020 is marked up a little, in order to reflect the supply that I mentioned.

To make unemployment gap.  Their positions to the horizontal line at zero reflect the number of standard deviations that from its neutral level.  For example, the output gap, which ends 2020 at about shown by the blue line to be just over a standard deviation above its Let's unemployment rate and utilization-have tracked each other closely over time, output and the natural rate of unemployment are direct comparisons easier in this chart, I normalized these measures by dividing each gap by its standard deviation, and I inverted the relative each is 3 percent, is neutral level at that point, and the inverted unemployment rate gap (in red) is just under a standard deviation past its natural rate.

Unlike the other two in about only A third measure, shown in black, is our measure utilization relative to an measures, manufacturing capacity utilization pertains to resource use 12 percent of the economy.  However, it is estimated independently of the other measures.

capacity utilization gap closely the other gap measures.  Since then, however, the manufacturing utilization gaps.  All three measures the their estimated neutral levels.  Over the projection difference grows into the largest 'gap in the gaps' on record. From the mid-1960s through the early 1990s, the tracks gap has mostly tracked below the output and unemployment fell sharply during the Great Recession and subsequently recovered, but utilization gap has been moving roughly sideways since 2012, even as the broader gap measures have tightened past period, the will explore some of the causes of this divergence to better manufacturing appears stretched.  The average World War II, and overtime hours, not shown, are also elevated. In the next few slides I understand the degree of tightness in the economy.  Although the reported capacity utilization rate remains low, labor in workweek of manufacturing production workers, shown in the left panel, is running at levels not seen since

survey of plant capacity, from which we derive our estimates of capacity managers why they are operating at less than full capacity.  Not right, is 'insufficient supply of local labor or the past few years to around its highest levels since time levels of capacity utilization would indicate. The utilization, asks plant surprisingly, the most common response is always 'lack of demand.'  The second most common reason, shown to the skills,' which has risen sharply the late 1970s.  These indicators suggest that manufacturing could have a harder expanding than the low resources in to the using the survey of plant capacity, shows the number of hours per week that line) are 120 hours per week, a typical level for these producers.  The these On your next slide, even as there is evidence that labor manufacturing are stretched, plant hours are below historical norms.  The panel left, also factories are operating.  Plants producing nondurable goods (the blue currently running about black line shows weekly plant hours for durable goods producers outside transportation equipment.  During the Great Recession, the work period of

The utilization gap would the 'gap in gaps' would nevertheless remain large. Capacity utilization baseline for their current state.  But if one assumes that the industries production patterns, capacity would be lower and overall manufacturing utilization rates be nearing its neutral level, but

suggest that factories are perhaps operating at a capacity utilization compared with the in mind, I now explore the principal reason why utilization has failed to increase materially the past few years. This and the previous exhibits somewhat higher 'short run' level of published figures.  With that manufacturing capacity the red and black lines in the left chart of the next slide, manufacturing typical, fell much further than real GDP.  But as shown in the table to the years following the recession, and despite GDP recovering at a as GDP, widening two. Comparing manufacturing IP and real GDP rose at essentially the same trend rate for decades, with IP showing larger cyclical swings.  During the Great Recession, IP, as is right, in the historically subpar pace, manufacturing has grown only half as fast the gap between the

[Laughter]  The top edge of the black region in the chart decomposed into the contributions red area shows domestic production of goods that are end of 2017, domestic demand for domestic goods was only around the same level as 20 years ago, in the exports account for nearly two-thirds of to 2017.

ample To conclude, the low rates of manufacturing capacity utilization suggest slack remains at the nation's factories even as other measures of resource utilization,

output gap and the unemployment rate relative to its natural rate, have The published utilization rates perhaps mask a the principal reason for low utilization is the recovery, which reflects the subpar pace of the overall such as the moved past their sustainable levels. higher 'short run' operating rate, but anemic manufacturing recovery layered with the composition and sourcing of domestic demand.

the lower operating rates also could partly reflect a longer-run that is independent of those factors.  First, in the cost of capital, plant managers could be choosing to hold a to satisfy unpredictable demand rather than the classic Finally, the literature on declining business form the past several years, less-productive to shutter-which, for this story, would prop up capacity and Steve will now continue our presentation. Granting all that, declining trend in operating rates responding to trends larger buffer of excess capacity practice of smoothing production by building inventories.  This would lead to lower optimal industry utilization rates. dynamism that documents the slowing of start-up activity suggests a flipside:  Just as new businesses have been slower to plants have been slower thus lower utilization rates.

Thank you, Norm.  I'll be starting off on the next page of your first for the FOMC, I'd like to open my remarks with a quote is excellent.'  [Laughter]  As far as the global economy is concerned, I'm I would go so far as to say the situation is excellent, but considering the MR. KAMIN. handout.

remainder of the forecast period.  A lot of in the advanced foreign like bad and labor strikes.  Moreover, EME growth-the blue line-surprised on the touch since the April Tealbook.  By the several prominent downside risks have become more apparent since your meeting, but unless they intensify further, they are unlikely to have more effect on foreign real GDP growth. As can be seen in your first slide, after growing nearly 3 percent in 2017, a little above potential, real GDP in the foreign economies is expected to maintain that pace this year and edge down just a bit over the attention has been paid to the weakness of incoming data economies, which pushed first-quarter AFE growth-the red line-below our April estimate.  But much of this weakness likely owed to transitory factors weather upside.  So we don't think we're seeing a significant slowing of the global economy, and we've revised our outlook down just a same token, previous than a small

U.S. Administration has rescinded the steel and aluminum tariffs, set a June 15 deadline protections against auto imports on grounds of national security, and trading partners have not in a full-blown trade war, but its probability trade and that yet in the data. Starting with trade policies, your next slide, the its temporary exemptions from to finalize tariffs on almost $50 billion in Chinese goods, announced an investigation to consider bogged down on negotiations over NAFTA.  Several of our signaled retaliatory actions.  We are is rising.  Additionally, policy uncertainty could start to weigh on global investment, although we haven't seen much evidence of

emerging markets, as with more pronounced vulnerabilities depreciations of their currencies.  Turkey and Argentina have external deficits, reliance on foreign about central bank independence.  But other countries have whether some common shock, such might be responsible.  The evidence on the role of U.S. is murky, as shown in panel 2; U.S. interest rates have been rising for many EME currencies.  In any with previous stress episodes, and so, at this point, EME turbulence A second risk factor relates to increased financial stresses in shown in slide 15.  Panel 1 shows that countries have experienced larger been hit hardest, reflecting their large fiscal and financing, and concerns also experienced stresses, raising the question of as rising U.S. interest rates, rates quarters, but the dollar has only recently appreciated against event, as the credit spreads in panel 3 show, financial pressures on EMEs remain muted compared remains a downside risk rather than a factor dragging down our baseline outlook by much.

Policy rates should take years will likely end up well below their The risks associated with trade, conviction that monetary policy normalization will proceed only very slowly in the advanced economies, as to hit their new normal levels and, in some cases, pre-GFC levels.

us to the final risk I'd like to discuss today.  Observers have raised a further prolonged period of sustained low interest rates-a so-called on profitability in the financial incentivize greater risk-taking, and thus threaten financial stability.  To the Global Financial System, or leadership of Vice Chair Dudley, initiated a study group composed of the ECB as well as let me mention that Bill has done a great job of chairing the of the committee will certainly miss him. This brings concerns that low-for-long scenario-would add to pressures system, explore these concerns, the BIS Committee on CGFS, under the of representatives of 19 central banks, led by Ulrich Bindseil myself.  As an aside, CGFS, and all of the members constructed for 22 countries, illustrated here example of the United Kingdom.  Focusing on panel 1, the baseline The 'low rates' study group focused on the profitability and behavior of banks, insurance companies, and pension funds.  As shown on your next slide, it considered three distinct interest rate scenarios, using the

all the countries in the interest rates to more normal levels.  In the low-forline, continued weakness in economic growth and inflation rates remain very low initially but later rise sharply in response to a pickup in from low levels.  This scenario is intended to address the possibility that might make them more scenario, the red line, is largely based on IMF projections for study and entails a gradual rise in long scenario, the blue keep nominal interest rates very low.  Finally, in the snapback scenario, the yellow line, inflation risk-taking adjustments by financial institutions to low rates vulnerable should interest rates subsequently rise.

slide, we estimated panel data to explain net interest margins, or NIMs, as well as the overall measured by return on assets, or ROAs, on the basis of the the yield curve, and macroeconomic conditions shown below, level of short-term interest rates (panel 1) and the slope of the yield curve significantly affect bank NIMs.  We are still investigating larger in the United States than in the advanced foreign economies. the effect of I'd like to briefly summarize our main findings, focusing on banks in the advanced economies.  As indicated in your next regressions profitability of banks as short-term interest rate, the slope of such as GDP growth and inflation.  Regarding the coefficient estimates both the (panel 2) positively and why the effect is However, the effect of these interest rate variables on banks' overall profitability, or ROAs, is quite small, suggesting that banks have found ways to offset lower interest rates on NIMs, such as by cutting costs and switching to fee-based activities.

these estimates, we constructed projections of bank NIMs and ROAs for and low-for-long scenarios, as shown on your next slide.  While NIMs a low-for-long scenario, ROAs would not.  It looks like on overall bank in the advanced The regression approach described here is less useful to analyze the return to shortly. Using the baseline would fall materially in prolonged low interest rates would have only minimal effects profitability and thus resilience to adverse shocks, at least on average economies. snapback scenario, something I will encourage risk-taking at banks, the topic of your next slide, were also moderately reassuring. interest rate period following the GFC, there was some evidence toward longer maturities (panel 1) and greater (not shown).  But the aggregate risk-taking; for example, credit-tothe GFC for both U.S. and AFE banks. rates have been especially still declining in the euro area and below 1990s levels in Japan.  Finally, extensive panel data analysis rates and measures of bank soundness and Our findings regarding the potential of low interest rates to behavior Looking at the low that banks had shifted their assets concentration in real estate loans in some economies data show little evidence of more exuberant deposit ratios (panel 2) have declined since And, focusing on two major economies in which interest low (panel 3), bank-credit-to-GDP ratios are remain well revealed little correlation between interest risk-taking.

these benign findings, however, we judged that a low-for-long scenario bank profits Despite could still engender material risks to financial stability.  First, as shown on your next slide, we found that interest rates may exert particularly strong effects on

whose interest rates are already very low, in which  banking markets are for funding. in light of their already low profitability, many small retail banks in indeed be at risk in a low-for-long scenario. in countries more competitive, and in which banks are more dependent on deposits Thus, especially Europe and Japan might of the GFC.  Such if interest rates remain low and continue to depress returns and in which economic growth policy tightening. Second, turning the page, the relatively subdued risk-taking we identified might reflect de-risking and the tightening of regulations in the wake restraint might erode profitability.  This might be especially likely in situations picks up, but low inflation restrains

snapback in interest rates could lead to previous period of low rates by extending durations and shifting loans to the The panel shows a simulation analysis featured in model of Swiss retail earnings fall even more in the snapback scenario, the orange line, than in line.

presentation on it. MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Norm, thank you for the manufacturing utilization.  I was one of the people who asked about it previously, so I appreciate how much discretion there is when businesses fill out those surveys, and let that makes small airplanes.  And, of course, the management team kept can't find workers-they're at capacity.  So I started asking more questions, week. I'm curious me give you an example.  I was recently in northern Minnesota, and I visited an aircraft manufacturer, Cirrus, telling me they just and I said, 'What kind of shifts are you running?'  And they run one shift four days a And I said, 'Well, why don't you work on Fridays?'  And they said, 'Well, our employees like

June 12-13, 2018

They said, to go fishing on Fridays.'  And I said, 'Well, what are your competitors doing?' 'Our competitors run three shifts 24/7.'

perspective, they're probably at capacity.  I heard that day.  I'm just curious, how would that be viewed in these is it completely up to them to determine if they're at capacity I'm curious.  From Cirrus's discussion, and I heard, well, if there's a lot more demand, they can pay their employees overtime and they can work an extra surveys?  Is Cirrus at capacity, or or not?

in place and normal shift pattern.  So if traditionally they run just one shift, then they forms assuming just one shift.  But if they're not as staffed up as they would to be, they might be operating, according to the survey of plant capacity, at less than because if labor and materials were fully available, they would be able to produce a MR. MORIN.  The plant managers are instructed to assume the capital sufficient labor, but the would fill out the like 100 percent, bit more.  But they would be answering as a one-shift plant.

KASHKARI.  I'm sorry, let me make sure I understand.  If they really did have a would then lead the surveys to conclude that they were MR. worker shortage, as some assert, that below capacity, that there was spare capacity?

MR. MORIN.  Right.

market view of the those two were sending different signals.  That would imply they could be consistent.  Maybe I'm misunderstanding. MR. KASHKARI.  So that would be a consistency between the labor output gap-meaning, we are running above potential-and still showing unused capacity in the manufacturing surveys.  I thought that given its capital and equipment in place shifts, did not have as much labor as they would normally MR. MORIN.  Well, again, if the specific plant, and running their normal number of

June 12-13, 2018

fully, then they would be running at a utilization rate that is lower use to operate the machinery than 100 percent, according to that survey.

actually mention how portfolio allocation you can were a European bank, would be looking at I hadn't before.  You may not have looked is there any evidence of shifts in portfolio allocation to a riskier portfolio? MR. ROSENGREN.  The low-for-long discussion was quite interesting.  We're having a conference on it this fall, although we're less focused on banks, more focused on nonbanks.  But I think it is an interesting issue.  You didn't changed.  If I were a bank in Europe, and I was thinking about emerging market Europe, for example, and increasing my exposure there, or taking other kinds of risks-did you look at portfolio risks as well as expanding the duration?  Because there are many ways that reach for yield.  And I would think the easiest, if I Eastern European or emerging markets in a way that at it, but data as were available on that topic.  We were a little advanced economies.  But in the case of example, we looked at measures they had of the quality of loans, and those did not to have deteriorated. MR. KAMIN.  We did look at such bit hamstrung by the lack of uniform data across Europe, for appear

And those actually indicated only a very moderate loosening of years since the euro crisis, which was a much smaller loosening of credit tightening of credit standards that had taken place during the issue of switching their lending to more higher-return And then, finally, apropos of the sources, such as emerging markets, European banks have done the opposite in response to

Let's put it this way.  We are looking at the ROA numbers in cases as being probably more in the neighborhood of a statistical than something that we think you should focus on MR. KAMIN.  Right. in which they are showing negatives aberration, rather .

MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  But you might say 'zero.'

Yes, exactly.  So the message that we take from these regressions is that in a positive direction, but ROAs less so.  It could be that a negative effect on ROAs, but that's not where been focusing. MR. KAMIN. interest rates definitely affect NIMs there actually is a genuine reason why there's we've

Okay.  I guess what I was thinking when you were describing this is, rates move around, bank stocks seem to be would suggest that they shouldn't be.  How should I think MR. BULLARD. when I watch market commentary and interest extremely sensitive to this.  But this about that?

this is looking at the effect of rates and yield curve slopes on bank profits holding constant real GDP growth and and other things.  Sometimes you have changes in interest rates that are a direct result of monetary policy shocks could be affecting a lot in the environment that banks face. MR. KAMIN.  Well, a couple of things.  First of all, interest inflation monetary policy shocks.  And in those cases, the of variables studies tend to show that when rates, bank stock prices do go down.  That could be because the interest rates is affecting the environment; it could also just be affecting the present future profits for banks. So you have to look at that experiment.  And I think event you have surprises in interest increase in discounted value of

And let me say that, with the changes in the SEP, median for 2018 from three rate increases to four, and with the increasing who are calling for a modest overshoot, I think this potentially could be a subject for the and insights that have after the staff briefing.

The latest data expansion. point that I the decisive confidence outlook?  Well, a careful econometric analysis, using a calculator, shows GDP growth has averaged a percent.  On the basis of this historical pattern and other indicators pointing to stimulus, an improving global economy, and favorable financial percent this year, well above the pace of potential, put at 1.7 percent. Why, you may ask-I'm sure President Evans will-does this give me greater regarding the economic that in the year following the Warriors' championship, real respectable 3.3 solid growth-like fiscal conditions-I expect real GDP to increase 2.8 which I still

[Laughter]  I view the risks to this balanced as the increasing downside risk associated with a deterioration of relationships is counterbalanced by risks and tailwinds driving stronger than is Now, as a side note for those such as President Evans, who at times has questioned methodology and conclusions of that the leading experts tell me that I am highly unlikely to be in a position of touting District's basketball team's championships in outlook as international trade expected growth.  This year's strong economic growth comes at a time when the labor market

That is obviously an historic rates, the are quite tight.  And, consistent with these indicators, my contacts increasingly coping with shortages by raising wages, They tell me they expect these moves to raise costs and to hold down near-term Other indicators, including an all-time high in the job openings rate, elevated quits very long average time to fill vacancies, and continued firming of wage increases confirm labor markets report difficulties finding qualified workers.  They're offering signing bonuses, and even bringing on less-qualified workers and providing on-the-job training. productivity growth.

the unemployment rate heading for historically low levels, it's an appropriate time the estimate of the natural rate of unemployment.  So my trusty staff recently this issue using three different methods:  a shift-share analysis, a linear regression rates approach.  And using each of these methods we triy to measure, and effect that changes in the composition of the labor force have had on the longrate. With to reassess revisited model, and a flow account for, the run unemployment age labor force have shaved about 0.4 percentage point off the natural 2010, there has been relatively little in the implied natural rate of unemployment.  Moreover, on the this analysis and conditional on projected future changes in the composition of the labor should put little, if any, additional downward pressure on the natural rate.  On the this analysis, my estimate of the natural rate is 4.6 percent, and I expect this to prevail Now, although the methods differ, the results are strikingly similar.  Changes in the and education structure of the rate between 2007 and 2010.  But, equally important, since additional downward movement basis of force, these basis of over the foreseeable future.

However, there are no risks to this inflation Turning to inflation, we're closing in on our 2 percent goal, and with the sustained very tight labor market, further, producing a modest overshooting of our 2 signs pointing to a more rapid takeoff in inflation.  Therefore, I view the outlook as balanced.

This is the same path I penciled in back in and results by 2020 in a nearly 1 percentage point overshoot of the long-run nominal view to be 2½ percent, as my estimate of the neutral real rate remains at interest rate path does not produce an inversion of the yield and that is reassuring, because much evidence does suggest an inverted yield curve is a With regard to appropriate monetary policy, my SEP projection is four increases March funds rate, which I still ½ percent.

And this analysis makes me the 'this time is different' arguments that dismiss out of hand the relevance of the evidence for the current situation.

Specifically, the to long-term rates, and that leads to a the high probability of Tealbook baseline-with its very strong growth accompanied by a sharp tightening in the stance of policy-compelling.

Labor markets have median expected it to fall by the end of this year.  In addition, momentum this quarter be quite rest of the the unemployment rate already at 3.8 percent and taking into account the fact that potential real GDP growth, the unemployment rate will quite likely fall be specific, my baseline forecast is that the unemployment rate will level off at further tightening labor markets from a starting point of already tight conditions.  In labor markets generate increasing wage pressures, which only partially show With my forecasts were above further.  To 3.4 percent, my forecast, tight

Like the Tealbook, my forecast is predicated on a higher federal funds rate than the path in the last time the unemployment rate fell significantly below 4 percent for an extended the late 1960s under Chairman Martin.  At that time, the Committee was the deficit financing of fiscal expansion generated by the Vietnam War.  By the '60s, the Committee assumed that inflation would not pick up, in part because it 1970, the unemployment rate full-employment rate, yet the Committee's assumption about mistake. The period of time was in concerned about end of the expected the unemployment rate to rise.  By the beginning of finally began to rise back to the inflation proved wrong, as we experienced a steady pickup in both inflation and inflation expectations.  Most historians of the Federal Reserve view this as a period of policy

may be different.  Although the Congress has put in place an labor markets, labor unions today are less wages and prices have three years. Of course, this time unfunded fiscal expansion at a time of very tight powerful, the economy is less susceptible to oil shocks, and, as a result, risen only gradually over the past enjoy well-anchored expectations today.  However, I am suspicious that this is fortuitous outcome of a benign inflation environment rather than a deep foundation upon wage and price determination.  Will employees continue to so plentiful jumping ship for higher wages elsewhere, I expect a continued that eventually will result in higher prices.  This prediction is buttressed an unemployment rate that lingers below 4 percent well past 2020. We also more a which we should rest our models of work for relatively stable wage increases in an environment where job openings are and when workers know that employers are desperate for qualified talent?  As fewer people lose their jobs and more consider gradual pickup in wages by my forecast of

June 12-13, 2018

One such concern is closely related to the supply constraint scenario in that scenario implies a very low probability of a near-term recession, it is at much higher probability of a recession in the medium term.  As fiscal stimulus a restrictive in response to rising wage and price than intended or desirable.  More generally, in the Tealbook's alternative view box that, taking into account rate, the process of trying to engineer a soft landing the substantial risk of falling into a full-blown recession. Although my baseline forecast is quite positive, that does not important the Tealbook.  While the cost of a wanes, and perhaps turns contractionary as the growth in debt-to-GDP ratio becomes more of concern, and monetary policy becomes more pressures, the economy could slow down much more I do share the concerns raised where we are now with the unemployment will run and is about financial fragility.  In the two weeks, there have been public announcements that Deutsche Bank is on the FDIC's list banks, that S&amp;P has cut their credit rating, and that they have had significant layoffs, at their prime broker.  Markets have certainly heard and understood these signals. trading at around $20 earlier this year is now trading around $11, with occurring at a time when many other banks have performed much better. My second concern is more immediate in nature past of problem particularly The stock price that was this decline

In response to these in 2016. the credit default swap rates for Deutsche look more like those for an Italian bank Europe's preeminent and largest systematically important banks.

President Williams, work by my staff strongly supports the material probit models using pseudo maximum likelihood techniques. Treasuries and the 3-month bond equivalent rate has significant out-of-sample predictive content for the onset of recessions at fourprobability of a recession for any particular term the funds rate.  The higher the funds rate, the more likely is the term spread.

BULLARD. mostly Committeeas we go forward.  In short, we are in a good state today, but state over expected to be temporary.  Nearly all forecasters have growth slowing in this year.  It's far from clear that we need to respond permanently to what is movements. Economic growth certainly looks relatively robust, but it is important to note that the current growth spurt is 2019 and 2020 from expected to be a temporary growth phenomenon.  In the past, when growth has slowed temporarily, the Committee has often looked through such transitory

market performance.  This is often discussed here as if this signals meaningful labor market performance most of the past two decades or more. Of course, coupled with relatively strong growth in real GDP, we also have continuing strong labor upward pressure on inflation outcomes.  However, the feedback from to inflation has been, empirically speaking, very weak for the Phillips curve is in the recent special memo addressed would change if monetary policy was assumed to follow current market-based 'dovish,' as opposed to the baseline staff assumption, which than the market.

Most people would consider that a better outcome over the things might happen in such a scenario, including pulling African American and Hispanic unemployment rates

But I think it is important to few years, inflation has consistently been below target, but the nevertheless began to normalize by moving the policy rate off the near-zero levels the balance sheet in a gradual and predictable manner.

These expectations are for headline CPI.  After adjusting that the market thinks the Committee will continue to undershoot its inflation target I realize that one could make other adjustments to these data, such as for premiums as well. That the Committee's preemptive behavior has paid off measures of on a somewhat, let's say by subtracting 30 basis points to translate to PCE inflation, we get the suggestion over the next decade. inflation risk

These expectations make sense to the Dallas Fed really not saying that we're going to see a lot of market-based measures of inflation expectations because they contain all information as participants place their bets on future inflation outcomes.  In particular, aware of the temporarily booming economy, tight labor markets, and future monetary policy, but that expectation is generally more 'dovish' I like the available market participants are recent changes in fiscal policy, all of which are priced in.

Second, we are the cause of the normalization so hard as say that the yield curve will not invert because the 10-year yield will think is a perfectly reasonable position to take.  I think this is fine, but we need current pace of policy normalization.  And, generally speaking, been getting this in recent market performance.

A variant of this argument that this time is different is that yield curve occur, but view, recessions are caused by shocks, and it's simply happened to occur right after that the yield curve is steeper than it otherwise appears.  I do not think this is the right leading theory of quantitative easing is that it is a signal. assets are being purchased by the monetary authority, the policymaker is unlikely to raise 'lower for longer.'

We Against that see the low likelihood.  Of course, it is say, that in my view, the back-and-forth over what will and won't be applied has already sabotaged its intended purpose:  Very few businesspeople will invest in new onshore jobs in targeted industries, given the uncertainty about

As I said last important factor than the unemployment rate in generating what we call wage pressures.

It may be there is just some hangover from the still reluctant to quit jobs they like for a moderate increase in Francisco Fed has published an interesting piece that points transformation rate markets know and we know that yield curve a fairly reliable predictor of recessions.

But on incoming information, I've edged up my growth and inflation forecast and edged forecast over the projection horizon.  My associated funds rate path than in my March projection.  Over the forecast horizon, I expect growth to be trend, which I estimate at 2 percent, and the unemployment rate to fall remain below its longer-run level, which I estimate at 4½ percent.

Board staff for the work they're doing to expand our understanding of how expectations are formed as discussed in the Tealbook.  In view of the importance of inflation forecasting, I'm looking forward to gaining more insights from this growth continuing and stable long-run expectations, I am projecting inflation to be near 2 percent over the forecast horizon, to be able to say it's been sustainably at our goal.  In my I thought we wouldn't get there until the first half of next year. I thank the inflation expectations for important work.  For now, with above-trend real GDP inflation and by the end of the year, I expect March projection, my forecast as broadly balanced.  Fiscal policy poses an upside risk to forecast horizon.  Trade policy is a downside risk, which could grow The outlook for foreign economies remains sound, but downside risks have risen in stresses have increased emerging market economies that face large current account deficits and external debt I view the risks to my projections over the over time. the euro area, associated with the political situation in Italy, and financial in some burdens.

Indeed, my outlook and assessment of risk it's appropriate for the FOMC to continue on its path of gradually raising the federal rate. in the United States.  But, for now, I see inflation risk as contingent on a path of suggest that funds than in my March projection, but I would it as a gradual path, given the strength in the economy.  Over the next year, my the median path obtained from the set of simple monetary policy rules across forecasts that are available on the Cleveland Fed's website. My associated funds rate path is slightly steeper still characterize path is similar to several

rise over time, if we don't to raise the policy rate, we'll fall further behind.  In the current environment, I think is more risk that we'll move rates up too slowly than too quickly.  Indeed, the Tealbook think through the risks.  Across all these scenarios, the policy prescription entails a rising policy rate path.  This is true is the scenario with the domestic sharp correction in asset valuations, suggesting that that's a situation to possible.  This again argues for continuing to move monetary policy toward a stance, especially as we do see signs that asset valuations are elevated. With estimates of the short-run neutral rate expected to continue there provides some very useful alternative scenarios that help us but one of even in the scenarios entailing global risk.

By 2020, we now see potential GDP growing a faster than 2 percent.

Moreover, given what I heard about business sentiment, I see some downside risks the robust investment rates-more

The model's revision simply reflects some kind of a regarding that as opposed to a more fundamental trend.  So it's too early to tell, but that is good news. As for inflation, the recent data have come in for our forecast.  And there are some outlook.  Commentary established inflation environment, and the underlying inflation trend estimated in our Chicago bank DSGE model seems to interpret a configuration of positive shocks that are helping with underlying inflation trends.  However, it's possible that the transitory shock.  There's a lot of uncertainty firming in the inflation expectations

The anecdotal and contacts suggest that the more moderate trajectory that is implied by of reports received from businesses tied to the sector indicate no discernible changes in the pace of spending relative to recent trends. in large part discounting the pickup in the consumer spending data we meeting.  As with the consumer spending data, I am not related to the mining and energy sector.

Moreover, the preponderance consumer As a consequence, I am have received since the previous inclined to read too much into the recent acceleration in business investment.

Overall, I see the risks to meeting our inflation roughly balanced.  As my real GDP growth and inflation projections have not the assumption of another 100 basis from today.  Implicitly, however, in my projection I assume some the expansion continues.  I think things get marked up my headline inflation forecast in gasoline prices, but continue perhaps objective as changed much since March, my SEP submission maintains points of rate increases movement in longer-term real interest rates as interesting if that doesn't happen.  But I will return to that point tomorrow.

We're a very export-sensitive region. steel and aluminum input costs, to be a strong capital equipment market.  As others have noted, there are a region over previous meeting, job gains remain strong, and headline unemployment rate 4.1 percent to 3.8 percent.  The staff's view is that slack is exhausted, employment; to me, that's very hard to square with modest both running for March.  As others have noted, it's also hard to square with labor force participation still appears low and the employment-tobelow pre-recession levels.  I continue to think that the staff are too about trend labor force participation and about the natural rate of unemployment. interesting work on the natural rate of unemployment done by Aysegul at the New York Fed.  She points out that the average American worker has become older in recent decades, and at the same time, the average American firm has and thus rate could be around 3.5 percent. For the national economy, consumer spending seems to be picking up after a weak first quarter.  Since the has fallen notably, from and we are operating well above full nominal wage growth.  Average hourly earnings and the employment cost index are at 2.7 percent, up only one-tenth the fact that prime-age population ratio appears pessimistic My staff briefed me on Sahin and better educated become larger and older.

Let's turn to inflation, which is now close to target.  And 12-month core PCE still is a bit below 2 percent, but I think we're getting there.

So this currently providing. quite then turns to how much accommodation we're meeting, the target range for the federal funds rate will be between the Tealbook's estimate of the neutral rate at face value-at PCE running around 1.8 percent, a neutral nominal rate would be around Thus, after this meeting we're only going to be modestly accommodative.  I could bands around where If we raise rates at this 1.75 and 2 percent.  If we take 0.5 percent-with core 2.3 percent. argue we might not have much accommodation at all, because the error neutral is are so wide.

In terms of uncertainties and risk, we have moved up our assessment of uncertainty for inflation to 'above average,' consequences of a very tight labor market-we don't really know how tight is too tight-and the uncertainties related to hear a range of views on particular issues, but a broad consensus that the baseline outlook hasn't changed much since the May CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Thank you, Bill.  And thank you, everyone, for a typically thoughtful and interesting round of comments.  I also kind of meeting, a consensus that I'm happy to join as well.

Part of that slowing transitory developments, like the weather and labor strikes, but softer coming from surveys of purchasing managers as well as some tightening of financial more persistent factors may also be at play.

One of our objectives was to try to distinguish between the sending now, and the signal they will likely send in the as assumed in the Tealbook baseline.  The ability of inversions of the yield curve to forecast recessions likely arises from two kinds of historical situations.  In monetary policy had been tightened with the demand, in order to reduce inflation.  In the second situation, monetary policy was a neutral or shock to aggregate demand.  In either situation, market participants expected the federal funds rate to be reduced substantially, and the yield curve inverted because resulting negative overcome Presumably, explains the well-documented power of the yield curve inversions to predict recessions.

Another benefit of focusing on near-term portions the issue of the secular decline in the that involves regressions and comparing the forecasting power of a near-term five-quarters-ahead forward rate minus the one-quarter-ahead longer-term spreads.

The analysis in the box hypothesizes that path of monetary policy market participants' expectations for recession and thus provide the sharpest inference of the curve is that doing so largely sidesteps long-horizon term premium.

I just want to bring this to this language is to reflect in the statement more communications that you had in the minutes of the May meeting. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

think it's a very nice analysis.  I an innovative thing to look at the short-term spread instead of the long-term spread.  I may well be near-term information there.  You know, it's very intuitive that markets in the policy rate, and the reason expecting that is that they think weaker economic conditions are ahead. Thomas's presentation.  And I will just give you my take on it.  I think it's think there are looking only one year ahead and then predicting a decline they are eyeballing these pictures, that the correlations are very high spread, so they are probably very collinear and Also, if you look at the implied probabilities of a like you are getting essentially the same signal Why not look at more signal? I would also say, just between the short-term spread and the long-term telling us more or less the same thing. recession, they are highly correlated.  So it looks from the two types of inversion, but, nevertheless, the more the merrier. than one

is that neither is predicting recession ahead today, which I consistent with what everyone is saying about this issue.  My concern in trying to have get to that state of being in we want to go to that state of the world. And the overall message to me think is this debate about yield curve inversion is that we have it before we inversion so that we go in with our eyes open, if Thank you.

Kashkari. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  President you take out the secular decline in long-term real interest rates.  But to me, those I just think about what is telling us, and if the near-term spread inverts, it's already too late.  It's MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  This is the near-term versus the long-term spread.  The thing I struggle with is, you talked about how the near-term spread has the advantage that are really important in assessing where we are, relative to neutral.  So if the near-term spread

June 12-13, 2018

President Mester said-by the time the near-term spread inverts, the recession is basically like already baked, and there's nothing we can do about it.

spread as an indicator-given these wide ranges with some information about where monetary policy conscious decision to do so.  Push back on me, I misinterpreting the long-term spread? So, to me, I'm looking at the long-term of where neutral could be-as providing us is relative to neutral.  Are we, in fact, moving to a contractionary stance?  And if we're doing so, we should do so with our eyes open and make a though.  I mean, am think the point that stress was not so much that the near-term spread would abstract from a decline in longof the discussion of whether the secular decline in long-horizon term is a particular challenge for any long-term spread that keys off, say, the 10-year yield try to run horse races, it is the case-unfortunately, for this purpose-that the MR. LAUBACH.  I'll be glad to 'push a little bit back.'  [Laughter]  I I tried to term real interest rates.  It's more about abstracting from changes in long-horizon term premiums.  That is part premiums as one element.  And I think, in part, this is really an unsettled issue because, while we can historically previous recession was a long time ago, and since then the long-horizon term premium has declined a lot.

out on whether you should control for the changes in the longor not, which is what the near-term spread does.  It's not so much about it is about the term premium.  That's one piece.  The other thing is I'm not quite sure whether I would quite go so far as to say, when the near-term spread too late.  As you can tell, a near-term spread of zero, say, doesn't lead yet, according model, to a high recession probability.  So it needs to invert, I would say, measurably.  So just going a little beyond flat, that doesn't, according to this model, necessarily signal a So the jury is really still horizon term premium long-term real interest rates as that inverts, it's to the if it's

I follow up? MR. KASHKARI.  Can CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Please.

how do you think about-you know, my staff went back through FOMCs and previous discussions of the yield curve and term premiums, et cetera, and remarkable.  In previous episodes, just as President Bullard said, 'This time is different' was, is different now.  And then we went into recession.  And so that you're talking about. MR. KASHKARI.  But previous it's all around, why this term premium I'm very loath to make these adjustments

MR. LAUBACH.  I would need to look at those CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Thanks.  Vice Chair.

discussions in the transcripts.

DUDLEY.  Look, I think this is terrific.  I completely agree with it makes perfect sense.  The yield curve inversion is all about the tightness of really focusing on market tightness of monetary policy.  And while it's true that these have been now because of the fact that recent years. VICE CHAIRMAN this.  I think monetary policy.  And by focusing on the short term, you're expectations of the collinear over a long period of time, they might not be as collinear the term premium has been moving a lot-a lot-over to the term yield curve version of the story, handing you a better tool to evaluate it, because it's really of monetary policy, which is the core of why the term 'yield curve So, you know, you can completely subscribe but I think what Thomas is doing is focused on the tightness inversion' has actually historically been so reliable as a signal.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  President Williams-I see a bunch of hands.  Actually, Neel.

June 12-13, 2018

Forgive me if I'm misunderstanding.  Why does the near-term spread about the tightness of monetary policy? MR. KASHKARI. give us a good signal

Because people think that the federal funds rate today is is going to be in the future.  Why do they think the monetary policy is tight enough to slow the economy down that the Federal Reserve will respond by lowering interest rates VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. high relative to whatever the federal funds rate that?  Because they think that significantly, and so they expect in the future.

do you think it's a signal relative to where they think monetary say, the medium term?  I don't see that as giving us better information. MR. KASHKARI.  But policy is going to be one year from now, not where they think it's going to be relative to some concept of neutral over,

DUDLEY.  Well, the reason they think rates are going to fall is they think policy is tight relative to the state of the economy.  So it's expectations.  The making a judgment about what they think monetary policy setting is today relative to the future.  If they think the federal funds rate is going to be lower in the Now, it doesn't mean that the markets necessarily have to get it right.  I mean, there is to be that the generally get it pretty much right. VICE CHAIRMAN because markets are what it needs to be in future, they are basically saying, 'Gee, policy is tight,' and that means there is a high risk of recession. also the possibility of the markets getting it wrong.  But the track record seems markets

Williams. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Okay.  President

I think. MR. WILLIAMS.  Loretta has a two-hander,

One. MS. MESTER.  Oh, I don't know, I don't know.  [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Two-hander?

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I'm counting two.  Okay, please go.

June 12-13, 2018

maybe it's a two-hander because Neel had mentioned my name. So my comment about it being too late was actually about looking at the model in the box.  And there it's very interesting, because, remember, the yield curve, it's also the term premiums in that model.  And credit in that model, and the output gap is in that model.  And I think that's something to I mean, it's great to have the yield curve slope as an indicator, but we have other other things that I think are relevant, because what bothers me about this And it's a correlation that seems robust, I grant you that. the cause of it.  And so I kind work in the Tealbook that David Miller did, because it tries to get a little bit about to really use monetary policy to Recession. MS. MESTER.  Well, [Laughter] other box, which was David Miller's it's not only the slope of spreads are think about. models that include yield curve thing is it's a correlation. But I think we have to get behind that and actually look at what is of like this other factors that are important.  And in that case, it was too late address what was going on in the Great is an interesting conversation, but we have to be careful about looking at curve in terms of the output gap, I think that's where we waited too I think this correlations and not really asking ourselves, well, what caused it?  If we get into a situation where we get behind the long.  And so that's my concern here.

Williams.  Jim, is that a two-hander? No, go ahead. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Thank you.  President MR. BULLARD.

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Go ahead.

just want to make a couple of quick comments.  First of all, the point that this expectation in the market that we are going to cut the rate over the clearly a sign that something's happened that has convinced the markets that policy, MR. WILLIAMS.  I actually I agree with next year is

June 12-13, 2018

is going to cut rates.  That is a similar thing, I think, as the inverted yield curve. at least now, is too tight, and, therefore, the economy is going to weaken, and, therefore, the FOMC

this box, and then even is that if you think about what this regression is actually doing, What is happening in time is, presumably, the FOMC is doing the best it can to set policy.  You get a negative shock.  The negative shock hits.  Markets look and say, collapse or the housing market rates.'  That's correlated with the fact that a I do have one word of caution about the interpretation of Thomas's presentation, and that it's going through history.  This gets to President Mester's point about causation versus correlation. monetary 'Okay.  Given the effect of that shock, will the stock market collapse?  We expect the Fed to lower interest recession follows that.

about reading this final box that Thomas put out and also reading in the box in the Tealbook, which is actually doing the reverse.  It's saying that we to cut interest rates gradually.  Therefore, the probability of a recession is low.  I don't there is a shock, people expect us to cut, and that's followed by a recession, and then long as we cut interest rates slowly, we are less likely to have a recession.'  I was implied a little bit, quite honestly, in the interest rates analysis is, it's not actually about tight monetary policy-I mechanics of it is cutting interest in time. So I would caution a bit the final bit expect think you can actually draw that conclusion, because what you're doing is taking a history in which saying, 'Well, as don't think that's what you were implying.  That Tealbook box, that this probability will be low because we will be cutting gradually.  An important part of this agree with Bill that that's the right interpretation-but the rates, and so be careful about running it forward if you run the same experiment ran, and we have all now run using   minus  * or using the Holston-LaubachThe last thing I will mention, just because I feel I have to, that you all r r

June 12-13, 2018

are also finding the same kind of thing.  There I actually feel that the real interest rate gets after that is somewhat is a shock that hits as monetary policy is recession follows from that. Williams estimates, you interpretation is pretty straightforward.  When, for whatever reason, the significantly above the neutral interest rate, the probability of a recession higher.  And I think the interpretation again is that there relatively tight, and the minus  *; the the short-term interest rate, what we call the short; the near-term spread; we have a spread-all of these are telling us, I think, basically the same kind of things.  But I So I would go back to this point.  We have a lot of these models:  r r forecasts of long-term would be a little bit cautious in interpreting them literally when thinking about what the probability of a recession is, say, in three years.  Thank you.

Brainard. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Thank you.  Governor think this is very interesting.  The distinction between and the 2-year yield in terms of term premiums being depressed and moving around a distinction, because the 2-year term premium has also been quite bit.  So I'm not sure it does accomplish what you are setting MS. BRAINARD.  Two things.  I the 10-year is not actually that clean negative and moving around quite a out to do, although the correlations are interesting.

as a proxy for the yield curve, you are essentially assuming that is not going to change, and yet I think we have some staff estimates that fact those So I'm just interested in whether you actually don't any of that ongoing balance And the second question is, when you use the difference between the SEP forecast and the long-run federal funds rate the term premium suggest the effects of our balance sheet rolloff would more than compensate, if in estimates turned out to be the case. longer believe that we are going to see any effects on the term premium sheet rolloff.

June 12-13, 2018

from me not to believe in this any longer.  We show it to you effect, we think, is most concentrated, say, in the range of 10 You're right that the analysis here is taking a little bit of a simplified approach, in that it mostly unaffected by term premiums, and that's certainly not in the upper-right panel provides you with some measure to may be true.  There is probably some term premium in there, but one would think that the secular decline are smaller than in the 10-year rate. MR. LAUBACH.  Far be it in every Tealbook.  However, I would imagine that these effects are scaling up roughly with the maturity.  So the term premium years. interprets this near-term spread as literally true.  Again, the dashed line which that the term premium swings and also

Your point on the bottom-right panel, which is the fund rate, then gradually lowering it, would lessen recession risks.  I referenced that just a second ago. explaining it.

this, but it is taking the model say, well, the yield curve slope is mechanically related to the probability of recession. restrictiveness of is relatively restrictive, for example, the probability of falling recession may be higher, the reason being that it then takes smaller adverse shocks in order follow that logic, because this curve here is not spread of minus 50 basis points, that pushes you to MR. LAUBACH.  President Williams may disagree with literally to One possible explanation for that could be that it really measures the degree of policy.  And when monetary policy into a to tip the economy into recession.  So if you then linear-so if you, say, induced for one year a a probability of recession of roughly 80 percent, according to this figure, whereas the minus 25 is keeping you at a lower level.

MR. LAUBACH.

Yes.

Harker. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  President suggestion for the if you add on a behavioral lens-if the market believes, whether it's right or causal, and if that belief becomes cemented in MR. HARKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The only thing I'd add is the a conversation at some future date, because that argument assumes a continuity in smoothness, that not, that this correlation exists, and it, in fact, is the minds of participants, that when things happen, they happen fast.  Right?  They don't happen in a nice, smooth manner.

a future date is, again, to put a behavioral economic, behavioral on this and ask if there's a sufficient number of market participants that actually they don't believe it's just some correlation-what does that imply for policy? I think a conversation at finance lens believe-and I think right now if you listen to the pundits on CNBC, they clearly believe this is causal,

Bullard. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  President just want to augment it by, and the 10-year rates.  And I want to point out the mid-1990s that this can be useful even that in 1994, this Committee raised the inconceivable today.  But we raised the policy rate 300 in an attempt to get back to normal. MR. BULLARD.  Again, I think this is a great discussion.  I one, noting the observations on this blue line in the top right-hand figure here, which is the spread between the 2-year situation, because that was one that influenced me.  And my point is beyond the recessionary situation.  So if you remember policy rate 300 basis points, which seems basis points

a recession seemed higher.  The real-time data actually seemed of the best periods that we've had in U.S. macroeconomic history.  So I that time, but we stopped somehow at the right time.  And we just right to get inflation really right at 2 percent through that whole little more useful than just trying to predict recessions.  That's And in 1995, the risk of very risky at the time, and it looked like maybe we would go into recession.  That was skirted, and as you all see here, this spread never did go negative, all the way through the rest of the 1990s.  And it set up one think that was a case in which we probably weren't talking yield curve as much at that was a case in which we did normalize, but got a good situation for the rest of the 1990s, with a healthy upward slope to the yield curve, but with a policy that was period.  So I think this is maybe a the point.

to call on myself with a two-hander.  I'm not sure if [Laughter] CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I'm going that's a legal move.

I think there's a disparity of views around the this, partly because people are still thinking their way through the issue.  So I think if really healthy if people were to say, that there is a range of views, and, second, that it's one of several things that we look people share their views on this, it would be useful if that Reacting to President Harker's comment: table about people are going to talk about it publicly, I think it would be first of all, at, not one.  And so I really think, as could be part of what we all say, and then we can have disparate views about what we think overall.  So with that-President Evans.

EVANS.  For Tom as well.  [Laughter]  Looking at the black line in the middle-left black line is just mean, it's just exactly what you would want if this was going to be an indicator of that it said 1973, and, you know, maybe it's I've been sitting next to President Williams for so long and it's the last time I'm going to in it the Oakland A's or the Cincinnati Reds?

alternative B.  Under a the unemployment rate significantly undershoots our estimate of the natural side, we are likely to overshoot our inflation target, it is appropriate to rate at this meeting.  It is certainly the action expected by the market. MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.  I support forecast in which rate, and, on the other raise the federal funds straightforward, but the path forward is a bit more the federal funds rate in the SEP still seems somewhat shallow. macroeconomic to linger for years risks a more pronounced unraveling.  We're in a difficult position, path that is not is that, at rate path that is somewhat too accommodative and which will linger for too long.  Accommodative monetary policy at a time when the and fiscal policy is expansionary, is a recipe for economy further into a state of significant imbalance.  If there were no inflationary associated with such an imbalance, I would be all for it, but assuming The decision for this meeting seems complex.  To my eye, the path of To be sure, a steeper path than the SEP path risks financial turmoil and the possibility of causing the recession we wish to avoid.  On the other side, however, allowing significant imbalances attempting to set policy so as to balance these risks and engineering a policy rate too steep, not too shallow.  I do not claim that choosing a path is easy, but my sense present, we are headed for a policy allow imbalances to unemployment rate is already 3.8 percent moving the or financial implications only modest wage, price, and asset price movements in such an environment seems risky.

join with others in congratulating on his retirement.  I've had a 10-year association with Vice Chairman Dudley.  He MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me Bill Dudley used to sit over here, and then he moved over there.  He's been my colleague on the Committee and at the COP.  Over the past decade, I visited New York many, many times and worked from the New York Fed many of those days, and I really appreciate Bill's hospitality and the time on those occasions to talk over issues facing the Committee.

'de-imperializing' the New York Fed and Bank with the rest of the System, which I think has been a longstanding to break that down.  I also think Bill did internationally at Basel and on key issues like LIBOR also many other issues.  Whenever I got feedback from abroad on Bill, it was always FOMC, in my opinion.  The Committee needs a financial the business view and also to complement the academic or modelsof the economy.  In my opinion, the Committee couldn't have had anyone better I felt that Bill did very important work in better integrating the issue for the Federal Reserve, and Bill did a lot important work for the Federal Reserve reform, but extremely positive, and I think he did a great job in representing the Fed on that dimension.  Bill also played an important role on the markets view to complement based view placed than Bill Dudley to provide that view over the past 10 years.  So congratulations on your retirement.

that we take that much to be 'hawkish' in economic growth is probably temporary, driven Mr. Chairman, generally speaking, I think we're in a good position today, but may soon become too 'hawkish.'  This is because it doesn't today's global interest rate environment.  Robust

The Committee has already been preemptive and is not at all lagging behind in part by temporary produce meaningful responses of the macroeconomic developments.

The Dallas Fed trimmed mean year-about where it has been for many years. Market-based inflation expectations expectations already incorporate all policy, and an expectation of monetary policy more dovish than the Committee's SEP median. This suggests that inflation rate is 1.7 percent year over one reason I want to the Dallas Fed trimmed mean. Reading some details overnight, I think the recent CPI report was affected by energy prices, with some bleed-through, probably, to core PCE inflation.  That's switch from core PCE inflation to

A yield curve inversion is lurking, and, if it occurs, it would be because this Committee is putting upward pressure need idea that term premiums if one not exist now, so we could read longer-term yields as reflecting fundamentals with respect to expectations of future real growth and future alternative A for today.  I think we're too 'hawkish' at this meeting.  Alternative A is not really all It is just a restatement of alternative B in a little softer language.  However, in my the Committee as we head into the second half of Taking these considerations into account, I support in some danger of coming off as that dovish. opinion, it would provide more optionality for

The phrase 'appropriate accommodation' could then be modified in the we could get rid of

A also stresses that inflation expectations need to be reand I think this is an important complement to the idea that the Committee is now some part of the forecast horizon.  Market-based inflation recovered since that time, even Paragraph 3 of alternative centered projecting, according to the median SEP, that inflation will slightly overshoot the Committee's target for some time or over expectations dropped dramatically in 2014.  They've never really though they've been up somewhat recently, partly on energy prices.

same in alternative A and alternative B, I would now think about not having paragraph 4 at all.  If you think a next step might be to paragraph 4 entirely. I think the changes in paragraph 4, which are the are appropriate and welcome. look at paragraph 4 today, it actually doesn't say much, so I eliminate conferences, I would say, 'What a good idea.'

I think that tempting that interpretation would be a In that light, I do have sympathy for President Bullard's arguments that he just gave being perceived as MR. BOSTIC.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Again, I do have concerns about this Committee being too 'hawkish.'

my team, that policy rate is in the range of 2¼ to 3 percent.  After the move That said, with the economy running as strong as it is, I believe, as does our policy needs to not be accommodating and that we should get our policy position to neutral. At present, my guess on the neutral today, we will be very close to the bottom of that range.

the dot plots as it is that we will raise real rates will rise as the expansion continues on and neutral range is our most likely stopping point.  But, as I Depending on how growth and inflation data play out in the coming months, I think it's at least as likely that we will proceed slower than what is in more rapidly.  My current thinking is that that the upper part of the estimated

June 12-13, 2018

noted yesterday, the question of where we stop gets very interesting if longer-term rates stall near where they are now.  Exactly how flat can the Treasury yield structure be before we are tempting fate?

following the research done on this issue, especially the staffs of the Reserve Banks and the Board, and we have done some extensions of that work on our own.

At the very least, These issues feel Without data suggesting we are highly likely to be 'falling behind the curve' on our inflation objective, proceeding cautiously is I think we should, for now, avoid signaling too much precision or certainty about where we are headed.

June 12-13, 2018

However, I have just one suggestion.  The paragraph 2 the nature of our inflation something along the lines of 'The Committee expects that further range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained activity and strong labor market conditions, and inflation may move 2 percent for a time before moving in line with the Committee's symmetric 2 This is a relatively small change that does, in my view, one important thing. Committee is willing to accept a modest to our 2 percent objective.  Inflation has consistently been an inordinate period of time, and it would be useful to underscore that modest undershoots.  I the proposed language will be interpreted as an overly strong signal of two additional very likely below its natural rate. language in alternative B concerns me somewhat.  I realize it's not intended to convey message that 2 percent is an upper bound or slightly leaky upper bound on inflation.  But I think the language would benefit from being more explicit about the symmetric objective-for example, gradual increases in the target expansion of economic modestly above percent objective.' It places additional emphasis on the fact that the overshoot of inflation with respect below our objective for the Committee is as comfortable with modest overshoots as it is with worry that rate hikes over the course of this year.

another matter, I would like to reiterate some concerns that I raised at our previous the federal funds rate. trades will be increasingly difficult to maintain IOER as a ceiling.  Further to the top of the Committee's funds rate target range will imply Banks relatively lower rates, because there will be less split.  Thus, the incentive for arbitrage trades will be reduced, and an already thin As a Committee, we may have to face this environment in the not-tooOn meeting.

With that in mind, assessments of are some points that I will be that, for me, neutral would mean, after today, more moves and would occur probably sometime in the spring of 2019 and certainly in the The first question I'll be thinking about and debating with my team and others is whether the recent fiscal stimulus masking the effect of tightening by the our removal of accommodation effect on economic conditions?

I've struggled with the question of how we'll actually know when we get to neutral when you take into account r * estimates do vary from one another really significant confidence intervals.  I've gotten comfortable, though, with the notion that this gradual path is a practical path.  It gives us time the health of, and pressures on, the economy as we normalize.  And my instinct is

this path, so long as the economy looks as strong as it does now, and to be open to pausing when we see meaningful signs of weakening.  Thank you.

Quarles. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Thank you.  Governor written. the policy rate at this meeting is consistent with the gradual pace of tightening that I appropriate.

In the near I think we'll have to revisit the assertion that 'the stance of monetary policy remains I also support Efficiency is good for the soul.

a minute to reflect on the pros and cons of characterizing the degree of about our strategy, it seems we think we are accommodative or tight is a good starting I want to take just accommodation in the statement.  On the plus side, such statements are a way to increase the transparency of our policy.  If we want to be clear and transparent being able to communicate whether point.

At the same time, I recognize that such statements are complicated by the considerable uncertainty regarding the value of the neutral rate.  One dimension of that uncertainty dispersion in the projected longer-run rates relatively optimistic run rate than most of the my forecast, policy remains Regarding the dots, a number of participants think that appropriate policy becomes restrictive next year.  With the higher long-run rate in

So, what I am is my continuing view that, strategy in monetary policy, just as, in my now tired cannot allow his uncertainty over the strength of the signal from the radio beacon the course he has laid in. Somewhat more economy, including the neutral growth, would seem to favor discretion in policymaking.  But discretion in policymaking can exacerbate uncertainty in the economy.  It's wrestling with as I get more and more experience on the Committee to the degree possible, we have to be careful not to allow our uncertainty over the structure of the economy to lead to uncertainty over our analogy, a pilot to translate into uncertainty about

It does not to me that time below the target needs to be balanced proportionately or even a little bit by might be equally troubled by being either above or below the taking into account the vagaries and volatility of inflation measurement, I have to say that One final comment on the symmetry that imply time above the target.

The near-term fundamentals for growth are good, and the inflation outlook has improved, although a questions do remain about whether 2 percent inflation target.

June 12-13, 2018

2 percent objective.  The increases in the funds rate has been a key element in this it allows for a sustained pickup in inflation before policy becomes overly restrictive. For some time, my views of appropriate monetary policy have focused on our need to bolster inflation expectations in order to reach our symmetric Committee's emphasis on gradual strategy, as received from our contacts point to larger and more broadly spread wage and which are being passed through to prices.  TIPS inflation compensation tentative Chicago Fed model results suggest the underlying inflation trend may have firmed a bit recently.  Nonetheless, the still-low in household surveys and TIPS pricing remind us that our work is a while longer.  This leads me to support a strategy of gradual rate increases for the foreseeable future.  In my SEP spirit of full transparency, in the SEP. A number of factors suggest this gradual approach is working.  The inflation data have improved.  Reports cost pressures, some of has moved up some over the past year, and some that levels of inflation expectations not quite done.  Policy needs to stay accommodative for maintaining submission, I assume today's action and one more policy move this year, thus ending 2018 with the funds rate target range at 2 to 2¼ percent.  In Governor Quarles's I'm Number Eight

four policy moves this year will be a close call, and expectations firm more setting by early 2019.  I don't think the rate decisions that get us to be careful to prevent say that the Committee expects future rate increases to be gradual.  In addition, it I think the decision between three or I may well support a fourth move, to 2¼ to 2½ percent, if inflation noticeably as we move through the year.  But regardless of that exact choice, it's likely we will be nearing a neutral funds rate to that point will prove to be difficult.  However, I do think we will need the public's rate expectations from rising too quickly.  To that end, it is key that the statement continues to might be useful for today's statement to signal that we are not too far from neutral after this

June 12-13, 2018

could do that in paragraph 3 by saying that, after this increase, policy remains 'only After all, as Governor Quarles said, it's inevitable that we're going could perhaps do it today. action.  We modestly accommodative.' to have to deal with this issue.  We after we reach neutral?  Then the choices become much more difficult.  In momentum in the real economy and a recovery in underlying trends will make it appropriate to push the funds rate to a modestly restrictive stance, great deal-perhaps just 50 basis points or so above neutral.  I would then likely What about my forecast, I envision that the inflation but not by a advocate a pause in rate hikes, allowing us to assess our progress toward a soft landing.  At that point, we should be prepared to adjust policy in either direction, depending on this assessment.

So I would say that if, at this being at neutral and what it means where we are, that might be close enough to a pause if we were to enough at that point and Now, I recognize that mentioning the term 'pause' seems really strong.  And when I think back to certain sports lessons, when an instructor unusual, they ask for a moment, we had more of an extended public discussion about and a full assessment of continue to go through-or we might decide that we've actually done we need to look more carefully.

underlying inflation trends remain stubbornly low, I could see turning to the strategy A, which aims to overshoot 2 percent by design in order to align inflation I share President Harker's views that we should Also, we should not worry about some modest overshooting of our 2 percent inflation objective.  A little overshooting would have the virtue of helping to firm inflation expectations symmetrically around the 2 percent target.  Indeed, if both inflation expectations and statistical measures of in Tealbook alternative expectations with our symmetric objective.

longer accelerationist limits the upside risk to inflation even a little below 3½ percent. Yes, I recognize we would have to be vigilant against overshooting too much.  But our view that the Phillips curve is no with an unemployment rate fine with today's rate move.  I also suggest we change the language in alternative B to describe policy as 'modestly accommodative.'  Looking ahead, I approach to policy normalization will remain appropriate, and I will be even in a data-dependent mode regarding the exact path of our future rate moves. In sum, I'm paragraph 3 of believe the gradual more

light of this, I think it's appropriate to move toward a neutral policy stance, which rates today.  But I will go so far as to say I think, once we get to neutral, I like to tease President Williams that the Laubach-Williams model is around its estimates.  So, for me, this is lot about the yield curve discussion that we had yesterday. So, in is why I support raising we should pause effectively and assess how the economy is unfolding.  And the big question mark is, where is neutral? very helpful, but it also offers very, very wide error bars why I continue to look at and think a the long-term interest rates are today, I find them low by historical standards, we have a lot of fiscal stimulus, we have the roll-off, and we're signaling a fairly steep future path of the policy rate.  And yet rates are still only at 3 percent.  There's information contained in that. You know, when I look at where notable because they're balance sheet long-term

yield curve as an indicator not only of a potential recession risk, also a feedback mechanism on where the neutral rate is.  So the discussion curve versus a long-term yield curve-the near-term yield curve think run.  If r* it would show up in the near-term yield curve, a laser pointer. we're always 'behind the curve.' I also look, again, at the but to me, it's yesterday of a near-term yield does not feel as helpful to me because I don't r * moves around a lot in the short does move around a lot in the short run, so that then I find it's not very useful as a policy guide because we're like cats chasing It's always moving, and spread between the 2-year and the10-year rates is going to give us where neutral is.  For example, if we continue raising rates and the long end of the inflation expectations are climbing, or real growth is taking off, that's a to raise rates without flattening or inverting the yield curve. So, to me,  * is a slow-moving concept that's responding to long-term changes in the r macroeconomy.  So I think the feedback on curve moves up because good thing, and that'll give us room

June 12-13, 2018

and the long end of the curve stays pegged at me we're getting close to neutral.  And then, whether it itself will trigger a it's correlated with a recession, we need to know going into it, with our eyes wide inverting the yield curve and running the risk of ending the expansion If, on the other hand, we raise rates 3 percent, that tells recession or open, that we are ourselves.

this yesterday-looking at previous the yield curve and term premiums.  And people made the point, 'Hey, the the yield curve doesn't count this time; this time is different.'  They said rates are low, it actually signals easy financial conditions, and this could a stimulative effect.  So we should know if we're making these exact same arguments that us to know that. I went back through with my staff-I mentioned FOMC discussions of term premium is low; that long-term interest have previous Committees made before we went into recessions.  I just want is, and I think the yield curve is going to be a good So the big question is where neutral indicator.

the public sphere about a recession in the Journal surveyed said that 2020 was the most likely date for the expansion to end, and 62 percent of Fed tightening was the most likely cause of that.  So, again, I just think we should eyes wide open and make decisions, recognizing the balance of risks.  Thank you, Mr. Last point.  There's increasing chatter in pipeline.  A recent Wall Street economists' survey said that 59 percent of the economists them said the go in with Chairman.

I continue to view MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you.  It will be challenging to calibrate sustain full sizable temporary stimulus at a

Treasury yields, on net, the beginning of the year.  Even with this increase, the spread between the 10-year and has declined from about 375 basis points in early 2010 to about in the United States, with one false negative and one false positive in five decades. We've seen a roughly 50 basis point increase in longer-term since 3-month Treasury yields 125 basis points currently.  Like many of you, I'm attentive to the possibility of inversion of the yield curve.  Historically, such inversions have had a reliable track record of predicting recessions in perspective, the current spread is about 20 basis points narrower the current 10-year yield by historical standards, which, below the average of 6¼ percent during the 20 years before the crisis. Treasury yield may be unusually low is that market in the longer run may be unusually low.  But a second reason may in recent To put those numbers than the average over the 45 years before the financial crisis.  Furthermore, it's helpful to take into account the very low level of around 3 percent, is well Of course, one important reason the 10-year expectations of interest rates be that the term premium has fallen to levels that are very low by historical standards. According to various estimates, the term premium has tended to be slightly negative years.

low by historical standards, this may temper somewhat the that we can draw from a historical pattern seen in periods with a higher term With a very low term premium, any given amount of monetary policy tightening will By contrast, when the spread between the 10-year and 3-month yields was at its peak of 325 basis points in early 2010, the measure of the term premium was close to 100 basis points. With the term premium today very conclusions premium.

June 12-13, 2018

tightening that might not have led to an lead to an inversion sooner, so that even a modest inversion in the past could do so today.

the term premium may be the asset purchases a number of studies suggest these in lowering the term premium, which was, of course, a stated goal purchase programs.  Another reason the term premium may be lower than in the past change in correlation between stock and bond returns, likely associated with changes in '70s and '80s these returns tended to be positively long-dated bonds as an instrument for hedging portfolio risks.  It's an open that correlation is likely to remain as negative as it has been recently, due to correlation will diminish as we move further away from the effective lower bound. One possible contributor to the low level of of the Federal Reserve and other central banks.  In fact, policies have been successful of our asset is the expected inflation outcomes.  Although in the correlated, more recently, the correlation has tended to be negative.  This corresponds to an increased demand for question whether better-anchored inflation expectations following a long period of low and stable inflation, or whether the two factors are taken into account, it seems likely the term premium will increase continued gradual the Federal Reserve-and, ultimately, reduced bond buying by by diminished expectations of high-inflation outcomes. If those somewhat, although perhaps not to the high levels seen historically.  The runoff of the balance sheet of other central banks-is estimated to put upward pressure on the term premium, while this may be counterbalanced in part

In the run value by 2019 and exceed it in 2020.  If the levels, that would, in fact, imply a yield curve inversion.  But if the term premium rises as the balance an inversion of the

June 12-13, 2018

important to keep in mind that the flattening yield curve suggested by the SEP is associated with a policy rate path calibrated to sustain full employment and inflation many of you, keep a close watch on the yield curve as an important conditions are becoming.  But yield curve movements will need to and the outlook, and will be one of several considerations in of appropriate policy. It's median around target.  So I will, like signal on how tight financial be interpreted, in the words of President Barkin yesterday, holistically, within the broader context of financial conditions forming my assessment the proposed change, alternative B, that would remove the forward-guidance language that was and no longer provides the Committee's policy reaction function. Related to that movement in the SEP median path, I support embedded in introduced a few years ago.  That language has passed its sell-by date accurate information regarding

sentence of well above its longer-run value and inflation was target, it was appropriate to signal that policy was accommodative.  As we transition judging whether policy is increasingly murky, as I think the table has revealed.  It could be confusing to have to decide each meeting instance.  This in turn would require clarifying whether our benchmark for this is is in the SEP and, I think, would be a natural thing for others to think we drop this sentence altogether or modify it to indicate that to sustain our dual-mandate objectives. I would also hope that, in the not-too-distant future, we revisit the second paragraph 3.  When the unemployment rate was below its from headwinds to tailwinds, the appropriate benchmark for accommodative, and how accommodative, will become discussion around this whether to describe policy as slightly or modestly accommodative, neutral, or modestly restrictive, for the short-run neutral rate, which is how I think about it but which is not reported in the SEP, or the long-run rate, which about.  Instead, I would suggest that we judge monetary policy to be appropriate

June 12-13, 2018

looks likely to provide a boost to demand in the near-to-medium On balance, I believe this outlook is consistent with median.  That path may well take the the medium run above our assessment of its longer-run value.  But if so, to boost the neutral rate medium term but leave little imprint on the longer-run neutral rate.  A in light of the long period of undershooting the target in order to achieve a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. In an environment of tightening resource utilization and above-trend growth, the sizable fiscal stimulus in the pipeline term that should fade somewhat further out. a gradual pace of increases similar to that in the SEP federal funds rate over the main reason would be the temporary fiscal stimulus, which is likely gradually over the continued gradual pace is warranted as well inflation think it would be prudent to long-term operating framework for our balance sheet sooner rather than later.  Recent factors, including expected changes in reserves associated with post-crisis or liquidity risk-management practices. Finally, in light of recent developments in money markets, I clarify the developments in money markets could reflect a variety of the supply of Treasury bills and changes in the demand for regulations

forces, so our reserves is likely to remain imperfect.  If, as I prefer, the decides to retain a floor system, we may find that we may reach the desired level of rather than later, which would have implications for the duration of our balance runoff plans. As Lorie discussed yesterday, it is hard to disentangle these different understanding of the demand for Committee reserves sooner sheet course, is an issue for another day.  For today, I support alternative B.  Thank But this, of you.

data continue to indicate above-trend real GDP growth and exceptionally tight and with the labor markets that are sustained a year. Recent labor markets.  Inflation is also within a whisker of our target, strong and expected to tighten further, we should achieve our inflation objective on a basis within gradual removal of policy range for the federal funds rate today.  Raising rates today and the These conditions warrant continuing a steady but accommodation by raising the target is appropriate, in light of the progress we've already made on our dual-mandate goals very positive outlook.

Language in today's in economic conditions and the progress we've made In particular, the removal of references to separate marketlonger-term inflation expectations in paragraph 1 appropriately I continue to expect a total of four rate increases for this year. statement nicely captures the improvement in removing policy accommodation. and survey-based indicators of reflects the fact that these measures are now largely in alignment, so such specificity is no longer called for.

at the bottom of paragraph 4-namely, that 'the is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in people have said.  This sentence served us well lower bound, but with a strong economy and policy normalization well under Furthermore, the straightforward forward guidance in expectations for the federal funds rate path. Also, the forward-guidance language federal funds rate the longer run'-has grown stale, as a number of near the effective way, its expiration date has arrived. paragraph 2 adequately conveys our current

the second sentence of paragraph 3 that President Evans, Governor Brainard, commented on, I do agree that this issue of describing policy as accommodative will more problematic.  I do have a very low view of the neutral rate, so I'm comfortable language in now.  But I do think that it's going to take quite a bit of discussion do we even mean by this sentence?  How do we think about instrument and our balance sheet policy?  And, that Governor Brainard made, when you think about 'accommodative,' this, versus other factors that are influencing the economic outlook, like In terms of and others become with keeping that in this room, specifically about what the interplay of our short-term interest rate policy getting back to the point how do you think of fiscal policy or other tailwinds?  That, I think, kind of gets at the short-run/longer-run view of r *.

I do think that we need to have a serious conversation about how this language should have that serious And what purpose will this sentence really get closer to neutral, whatever that is, and we're really in, I think, more of a dataof the stance of policy?  Thank you. So evolve and when that should happen.  I think we're going to have to also conversation about, how do we understand that? serve as we dependent kind of position in terms

DUDLEY.  I support alternative B as written.  [Pause.]

VICE CHAIRMAN [Laughter]

PRESIDENT WILLIAMS   Who knew? .

June 12-13, 2018

DUDLEY. The case for continuing to remove monetary policy very compelling, as I said yesterday. VICE CHAIRMAN accommodation gradually, I think, remains my final FOMC meeting-number 92, as the Chair mentioned yesterday-I the longer-term issues that the FOMC will be the next few years.  You should take this as evidence that it's going to be me to let go and step down from the FOMC.  As I noted last evening, even though we're remains lots of cool stuff to work on, so I wish I As this is thought I'd put in my two cents on some of wrestling with over hard for at a good spot in the economic cycle, there could work on it here.

are three areas that I want to touch on briefly.  First, I think it's important not to get After all, the rate we really care about is the short-term real rate that applies today far out in the future.  And that's influenced not just by long-term conditions, the impulse coming from fiscal policy, and the momentum of else being equal, if animal spirits suddenly become necessitate a somewhat higher There overly invested in the r * concept.  Not only is r * unobservable, but it's likely to move around over time. that's neutral, not some time factors like the productivity trend and demographics, but also by shorter-term ones, including the evolution of financial economic growth abroad.  For example, all more exuberant, causing financial conditions to ease, this should short-term interest rate path and vice versa.

put too much emphasis on another unobserved monetary policy.  I wonder if outsiders might view this daft.  [Laughter] Thus, I hope the Committee will not variable.  We already have the natural rate of unemployment, potential GDP, and the GDP gap, which we use in our discussions of musing about a bunch of unobserved variables as a bit is as, it's not just on the basis of an estimate of also by looking carefully, as John You know, I would judge where neutral r *-I mean, I think r * is an interesting starting point-but

How are things that we the economic outlook? r conduct of to talk about is one of my favorite subjects.  I very much hope Committee retains the current floor-type system.  Not only is such a regime much less corridor system, but I also think it has other really advantages that are not really widely acknowledged.  The most important is that, a corridor system, it allows us to provide better support in maintaining financial The second thing I want that the complex operationally for the Desk than a important relative to stability.

a corridor-type system is that it can actually constrain the Fed's type of open-ended lender-of-last-resort backstops that can help support With a corridor system, the reserve adds from draws on the lender-of-lastfacilities have to be offset by reserve drains in order to keep the amount of the reserves in system at a sufficiently low level to maintain control of the federal funds rate.  This that are either large, or open ended, unattractive.  I think this is one term auction facility that we introduced in early 2008 were One disadvantage of ability to provide the financial stability. resort the banking tends to make facilities reason why the initial sizes of the relatively small.

Facility, which we the system.  If you remember, in the TSLF, we swapped Treasury collateral for lesseffect.  The primary dealer credit facility only came got in trouble and was merged with J.P. Morgan. Perhaps an even better example is the Term Securities Lending introduced in March 2008.  It was chosen in large part precisely because it did not add bank reserves to liquid collateral, and there was no reserve later, after Bear Stearns

banker, I wouldn't want to feel constrained in my ability to introduce broad more likely to with their counterparties-that is, borrow and lend-when they know a financial conditions were to deteriorate. more feasible in a floor system because there's no conflict between the liquidity provision and maintaining control of short-term interest rates. As a central and credible lender-of-last-resort facilities.  Private-sector participants are continue to engage central bank backstop can be drawn on, if economic and Such facilities are much goals of the FOMC should mitigate the risk of a return to the effective lower interest rates.  Now, some have proposed addressing this by raising the reasons for that.  But I'm not for several reasons.  Most important, I don't think that a higher inflation target the Federal Reserve's congressional mandate to pursue price we push it higher, the to balk at that. The third issue I want to talk about is the open question of whether change its strategic framework in order to bound on short-term Federal Reserve's inflation objective.  And I understand the supportive of this would be viewed as consistent with stability.  I think we've sort of gotten away with 2 percent.  But I think if Congress would start

ways of reducing zero-lower-bound risks than raising the fact that we now have tools, such as forward to use should circumstances anchored. Moreover, there may be better inflation target.  For example, emphasizing the guidance and large-scale asset purchases, that we would be prepared warrant their deployment, would help keep inflation expectations better alternative might just be to emphasize that we want inflation to average around medium term.  In other words, undershoots of our inflation objective would be move away from our current 'bygones' policy, in which A simple 2 percent over the offset by overshoots.  This would be a we do not attempt to offset misses but, instead, always try to push inflation back to precisely 2 percent.  If we move to such a regime, this presumably would help keep inflation expectations

June 12-13, 2018

anchored.  This relatively subtle shift in how we talk about inflation might achieve benefits of an explicit price-level targeting regime while avoiding the complexity and we adopted a PLT regime explicitly. more firmly most of the the challenges in communication that would surely follow if communicate effectively in practice. aims for 2 percent average inflation over time should be easy to being there with our emphasis that the target is symmetric.  We've already sort of moved a little bit in that direction. You know, I think Chairman Bernanke's suggestion of an asymmetric PLT regime is conceptually attractive, but I think it might be difficult to In contrast, an inflation regime that to communicate.  In fact, we're probably already close inflation

I want to thank everybody for last night's reception and all of the nice comments President Rosengren.  I want to put a little bit of what I said last evening 5½ years for the record to come out, but I still want it to be there. First of all, I want to thank everybody for being such good colleagues.  It's really to participate in all of these meetings over the past 11½ years and have you.  I'm so impressed with the commitment of Finally, from Chair Powell and on the record.  I mean, it'll take [Laughter] been a pleasure for me the opportunity to collaborate with every one of everybody associated with the Fed to our mission.

to do what will need to be done in the years adjusting monetary policy to keep the economy on an even keel or next inevitable-hopefully much smaller-financial crisis.  Most important in mind is the need to maintain the courage of your convictions; to try to anticipate rather than than waiting; and in the nation's all strive to do this, I'll rest easy.  Monetary policy the players change, but the chain itself remains unbroken. Second, I'm confident that you'll continue ahead, whether that's responding to the my react; to make choices affirmatively when needed-which means acting rather to be willing, regardless of the short-term political consequences, to do what's long-term interest.

to remind everyone that I'm going to be announcing at the press conference meeting.  The delayed effective date is to make the point that this is about policy announcement could easily be market sensitive, so please do I'd also like today that we'll be moving to having regular press conferences after every meeting, beginning with next January's better communication and transparency and that there's no message about the path of here.
