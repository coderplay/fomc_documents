Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on July 31-August 1, 2012

July 31 Session

Leckman is going to take pretend he's not here.  Item 1 on our agenda is our special topic on policy for this.  Let me turn it over to Jon Faust. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon, everybody.  Britt a few pictures; just rules.  You received the material things as good advice for monetary rests on the view that the robust lessons that economists have learned raise the real interest rate in response to an increase in inflation interest rate in response to slack in resource utilization. MR. FAUST. 1   Albert Einstein is often paraphrased as saying, 'Make simple as possible, but not simpler.'  This is probably policymakers and theoretical physicists alike.  The attraction of simple monetary policy rules about monetary policy are rather simple.  First is the Taylor principle:  Policymakers must consistently above its target value.  The second lesson is that a dual mandate central bank should generally lower the policy

Taylor (1993) rule, and as your first exhibit, the prescriptions of the rule mirror surprisingly FOMC from 1988 through 2007. at the time described themselves as reacting flexibly under a 'look at argues that following led to better performance.  The case generally includes the three claims listed in panel 2. John Taylor enshrined these two principles in the shown in panel 1 of well the historical funds rate as set by the Policymakers everything' approach to monitoring the economy, but Taylor his rule would have been simpler and would have for simple rules

The research literature summarized in the background memos is most informative on the first of these claims, regarding the degree to which simple rules embody sound

In my comments today, I will highlight a few of the more important contentious issues raised in the memos, starting with the performance what I will nostalgically call 'normal times'-that is, times bound on interest rates is not a major consideration. monetary policy. and potentially of simple rules during when the effective lower

It was performed by former Federal Reserve System staff, most notably, President Williams and Levin, along with a number of coauthors.  The background memo by Keith research identifies several types of rules macroeconomic models.  The your attention are well-represented by the six rules in panel 3, examined in Tealbook, Book B, plus what we call an (1999) rule.  The inertial Taylor (1999) rule lies midway between the (1999) rule and the outcome-based rule that is used in generating the rate term to (1999), but does not include the additional terms in the change in the gap and generally well, but as the literature makes rules performs flawlessly in all models.  I'll highlight two issues There is a large literature on the performance of simple rules in normal times. is worth noting that much of the most influential work in this area current or Andy Kuester of the Philadelphia Fed provides a recent summary of the relevant results in a suite of modern DSGE models.  This body of that generally perform quite well across a range of serious contenders for including five rules regularly inertial Taylor simple Taylor Tealbook baseline.  The inertial Taylor rule adds a lagged federal funds Taylor the change in the policy interest rate that are part of the outcome-based rule.  These six rules have each been shown to perform clear, none of these leading to differential performance.

error.  All of the rules except the first-difference rule respond to the gap; the first-difference rule largely sidesteps difficulties measuring the gap by responding only to the change in the gap. As noted in the top panel of exhibit 2, the appropriate measure of the output gap is a contentious issue in theory, and in practice, the output gap is subject to substantial measurement level of the level of the level of the output gap and supports the view that the first rule delivers good performance in many models.  On balance, however, of the gap probably goes too far.  Large output gaps are gaps are likely to be apparent even in the face of realistic gap tends to a significant response to the level of appropriate. Research supports the view that measurement problems may justify reducing the response of policy to the difference totally ignoring the level particularly costly, and large measurement problems.  Thus, a rule that responds to the level of the provide accommodation when it is most beneficial.  For this reason, research indicates that under realistic measurement error, the gap remains

The policy prescriptions of all of rules, except the Taylor For example, the outcome-based federal funds rate, implying that the policy prescription in the current quarter is heavily dependent on what was previously prescribed.  The first-difference rule shows even greater inertia, with a coefficient of one on the lagged federal funds rate. Research indicates that high inertia, such as that in the first-difference rule, can be beneficial in some models, but high inertia can be

In forward-looking models-that is, models gives policy substantial economic decisions, which can substantially improve stabilization mechanism works, in part, through occasionally inducing goals of policy, and because and undershooting are contentious topics, it may be worth spending a Under any inertial rule, a change in policy carries the implicit forward that the policy in which agents' decisions depend importantly on long-term interest rates and expected conditions more generally-this persistence leverage over outcomes.  The inertial modest overshooting or undershooting of the overshooting moment on the role this mechanism plays.

Under rule, unemployment smoothly approaches the NAIRU from beginning in late 2017.  Panel 3 shows the corresponding here plays a crucial role in earlier more-rapid decline in unemployment.  If agents instead requires a slower approach.  Note that under the nominal incomerule, inflation and unemployment both spend considerably more time close desired values than they do under the Taylor (1999) rule; the conventionally are substantial.   Attaining the benefits follow policies that support modest and undershooting.  Whether the FOMC could credibly deliver such not, greater demands on credibility than the demands on Attempting to bring, say, unemployment back to target quickly shares some properties with a Washington Nationals is attempting to get to first base quickly.  The player can arrive more quickly increases his pace to the upon arrival.  The only way to avoid expected (and actual) overshooting is approach the bag more slowly.  Panel 2 of exhibit equivalent of this phenomenon.  The figure shows the simulated paths of the unemployment rate as reported in the current Tealbook under the Taylor 1999 rule (the black line) the non-inertial Taylor above.  Under the nominal income-targeting rule, unemployment approaches the NAIRU at a significantly more rapid pace, and the unemployment rate mildly undershoots the NAIRU paths of inflation, with the nominal income-targeting rule (the red dashed line) leading to modest overshooting of inflation-inflation peaks at around 2.2 percent. Unlike the baseball case, the expected overshooting bringing about the expected policy to tighten to avoid overshooting, the anticipated future slowing would damp consumption, hiring, and investment-as with the base runner, avoiding overshooting targeting to their measured welfare gains of inertia in this case from inertia would require the FOMC to credibly overshooting policy is open to question.  The inertial policies we are discussing here may however, put dramatically credibility posed by the exit principles or the consensus statement regarding longerrun goals and strategy.

Quite to the contrary, the major lesson from the literature is illustrated in the standard optimal policy simulations regularly Specifically, maintaining accommodation for rules would suggest can have substantial benefits.

generally, there are a number of prominent structural factors operating in More the current context that are not accounted for in the research regarding normal times:

Nonstandard monetary policy tools are being employed, fiscal policy and housing and credit markets are unemployment may be altering labor market dynamics.  Any of these structural factors might warrant deviating from a rule designed to operate argument for deviating from normal rules constraint on policy accommodation imposed by the effective lower a way that raises special risk-management accommodation. There is an additional risk-management at present.  The bound interacts with uncertainty in considerations, and standard theory suggests that these considerations provide another rationale for more-than-normal policy

at the cusp of rule, positive bound will keep the central central bank leans against being at the effective lower bound has costs-as we all think effective lower bound. To understand the essence of this argument, imagine an economy taking off from the lower bound.  A central bank that follows a simple policy whenever unconstrained, will raise rates in the normal way in response to a shock.  In response to a negative shock, however, the zero bank from providing normal accommodation.  Because the positive shocks but does not symmetrically cushion negative shocks, policy imparts a negative bias to output growth and inflation.  On average, then, shocks push the economy downward.  If it does-then policy should instead be biased toward extra stimulus to help push the economy away from the the good policy FOMC were to choose to focus more heavily on some rule or be important to resolve some issues including the role of the are good reasons, however, that a central bank an extended spell at the effective lower bound might choose to deviate Overall then, as noted in the final panel, research is generally supportive of view that, in normal times, some simple rules capture much of what should aspire to.  If the rules, it would probably measured gap and of inertia.  There experiencing from its normal-times policy behavior.

Rules could well play role in such a framework, but the framework would provide a systematic way to assess when rule-based prescriptions should be overridden.  As touch briefly on the principles of forecast-based targeting, which could provide useful tools for gauging running a number of policy chooses the policy paths for inflation and unemployment that 'look the best' characterization takes on more meaning when one models, the projected paths of unemployment and inflation The main idea underlying forecast-based targeting is that, loosely speaking, sound monetary policy at any point in time can be identified by projections conditional on different policy paths.  Then one simply that delivers the forecast under the objectives.  This general realizes that in standard must bear certain relations under appropriate policy.

That remarks. models, if inflation is below its objective and unemployment is above its objective, appropriate policy must show the projected paths cutting through its optimal long-run level.  That is, under policy that appropriately balances the costs of attaining the elements of the dual mandate, we must project at least mild overshooting or undershooting for one of the variables.

Thank you very much.  That was very interesting background work.  We thank you and the other staff for interesting exposition.  The floor is open for questions or comments for Jon.  President Lacker.

excellent trio an overview of a large subject.  I have two general comments in reaction to findings that were quite a surprise to me, although expected this.  What the memo showed that the frequency distribution of liftoff dates is and flat, covering a wide range of plausible dates.  I think I was assuming that if given model and a given rule-if you wanted to place a lot of confidence in one tightly bunched around your modal forecast given model and a given rule, you for us to lift off.  Then you back away from going to get more uncertainty because you going to talk about policy now, forward-guidance to reconcile the certainty that is conveyed by MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I compliment the staff for an of papers providing this.  The first one is that there were some they probably shouldn't have been.  In hindsight, I probably should have I'm referring to is where relatively broad you took a model and one rule-you'd have liftoff dates fairly of a liftoff date.  Instead, the results showed that even with a should be relatively agnostic about when it's likely certainty about the model and the rule, and you're don't quite know the model and you're not sure which rule characterizes good policy, and so on. This was a really striking finding to me-and I know we're not but it's about policy rules.  To me, this suggests that the proponents of the language we have in the statement now really need the language in the statement with the agnosticism that the staff's analysis suggests ought to

issues.  The memo describes attractive.  One is that the more that first-difference rules do relative to alternatives.  I this context that over the last at least 10 years or so that I've been analysis of the that the profession moved decidedly in that been different.  To me this is an argument in rules a little more weight.  The staff also points out that Orphanides and Williams-documenting historical evidence that natural rate can lead to pretty serious policy errors.  The only thing I'd the gap seems to go too far, and as I listen to you, I think you base that gap is really large, we should care about it.  We do about a large output gap.  And the other was that large output gaps tend to be persistent. The second comment has to do with a couple of circumstances in which first-difference rules are relatively expectations are forward looking, the better would just point out in involved with the FOMC, I've seen the staff move decidedly in the direction of  adopting the approach of assuming expectations are more forward looking, both in their economy and in their analysis of policy.  It's obvious direction as well, although the timing might have favor of giving first-difference uncertainty about the natural rate favors first-difference rules, and, obviously, there's a large literature on this-for example, misjudgments about the add to this is that while there's been research out there, I don't think it takes on board necessarily the extent to which-and this is extra evidence here-that within the Committee, there's a tremendous range of views about the natural rate.  And in this regard, you made a comment, Jon, that ignoring the level of on two things.  One is that when the output care Well, there are estimates of the output gap based on DSGE models in which the output gap is gap in those models.  The argument that we care smaller.  Moreover, that's the welfare-relevant

July 31-August 1, 2012

some less-than-agnosticism about the level of the gap; it's based on gap.  And then I think it is true as well that in DSGE models, those gaps potential that imposes a substantial amount good if you don't know much about the output gap, but we do know enough to say the rule.  Those are my two comments about the rules, and again, I about large gaps is based on some views about the are less persistent than the ones based on a notion of of smoothness on the estimate of potential.  The argument seems to be, well, the first-difference rule is really you shouldn't ignore commend the staff.

you want to say something, Jon? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Do were somewhat that ran some simulations indicated there was dispersion.  We were surprised at at the zero lower bound. That means that the notional interest rate implied by these rulesor below the bound-the notional value is about three years, and since it lurks near the bound for years, any positive shock may lead you to lift off.  If the rule doesn't have inertia, the next bound.  And so it's the fact that we're lurking bound for a long time that leads to this result. MR. FAUST.  Let me make a couple of comments.  I think that we surprised about the dispersion of the liftoff dates under these rules, although I think a number of Reserve Banks the degree.  And just to get some intuition for why that's true, we happen to have a baseline forecast that has the economy kind of moving slowly away from the conditions that warrant being I'm saying 'notional' because it may be negative lurking near the zero lower bound for three negative shock will also send you back to the zero near the zero

Lacker raised some important questions about whether the current forwardlanguage would be appropriate if we were following one of these rules, and, as he a bit problematic.  Now, that doesn't mean that matter for you all to President guidance indicated, I think this evidence says it would be this dispersion characterizes how the FOMC is actually behaving; that's a

July 31-August 1, 2012

I think the memo suggests that you wouldn't want to follow any of these rules, that are more likely to lift off.  The other rules have a much that might well be consistent with the language that says 'at least until' a certain consideration, tomorrow perhaps.  About the first-difference rule, there are cases for it.  When I say that the research suggests that it goes too far to eliminate the result comes from research that incorporated the empirical properties gap was a good idea. decide.  However, especially the jumpier ones-those later liftoff date point.  That's for later some good level of the output gap, that of historical measurement errors, and so it reflected the actual ignorance that we experienced and still found that putting weight on the

I add a couple of things to this?  First, one problem about guidance is that in time.  Going back to the simulation analysis in the memo, by strictly rule you can have episodes in which the liftoff date pops up for a quarter or two and going to matter to the market and bond pricing, guess the average level of the funds rate over time, and the distribution of That average level is a much less jumpy variable than the liftoff Now, saying the Committee should think about yourself date is for what the average stance of policy might be and how sensitive the average stance will be to economic conditions.  The third thing I'd say, and this is up to the Committee that in interpreting the statement, it's conditional.  It's a probabilistic statement Looking at the market's views about the MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Can the liftoff date that the Committee might want to think about in terms of forward the liftoff date in some ways is a lousy summary statistic of what the relevant policy stance will be because it's one point following a then goes right back to zero.  In terms of what's they're really trying to that average level over time. date you get from following a particular rule. forward guidance in terms of a path, that's a much harder problem.  But you can lead astray by focusing too much on the distributional statistics of the liftoff date and how meaningful that of policy to decide, is about the liftoff date, because it says it's 'likely.'

July 31-August 1, 2012

a range of views.  I think everyone as well as probable date of liftoff-what's priced into options-you get understands that there's a considerable dispersion of views about possible liftoff dates a considerable range of views in the markets about what the modal liftoff date would be.

follow up, Mr. Chairman?  I agree that the liftoff date is a lousy as I think you put it, for our future policy, and what was surprising about the how I read those graphsin the statement to connote at least we are not going to raise rates until then.  That's what I take away from you say there are other rules that have later dates, then maybe this distribution should be a going forward.  It might be more informative than MR. LACKER.  Could I summary statistic, memo was the evidence that so strongly buttressed that view.  That's that we're more uncertain about the date.  I take the language a 50 percent chance that the 'likely' language, and that seemed inconsistent with the simulations that the staff showed us. If systematic part of what the staff reports to us just the line drawings that show single modal outcomes under various scenarios.

One can respond to that in a couple of ways.  One way is course, what we've been talking about is what we think economic conditions commitment.  You didn't really talk very much about credibility and the commitment to a certain policy, even if it's not necessarily ex post be time-inconsistent-there may be some benefits ex ante.  And that's a would agree that we need to work as a Committee to try to with you that that would be a better way to do it. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. that what they find is a purely unconditional distribution; it isn't contingent on what happens in the economy.  Of are likely to be and, therefore, how we will respond to those conditions.  So, first, it's a conditional commitment, not an unconditional commitment.  Second, there's no discussion here about the value of possibility that by making a optimal-that is, it may question that could be posed.  But I find a way to characterize the future path more explicitly in terms of economic conditions, and I agree

July 31-August 1, 2012

a later date, and as we know, comes close to and is fully consistent with the and the inertial Taylor rule has a later liftoff date.  Remember, we were using because we were running these simulations before the July baseline was If we had done it for the July baseline, the inertial Taylor rule would have had an even consistent with the language. MR. FAUST.  Let me add one comment.  There are rules that deliver they're in the memo.  The nominal income-targeting rule, approximating optimal control, which has a very late liftoff date forward guidance; the June baseline available. later date of liftoff consistent with the language.  Those inertial rules require some degree of commitment as we touched on, but could be completely made the an inertial Taylor rule can incorporate a threshold for action-just because it's 27 basis you don't lift off.  In one particular case that we considered, you wait until it is 75 basis for the liftoff date is shoved way out into the future, and the that there can be very responses that have certain types of inertia.  Those going to respond to what just could be a transitory pickup in the economy, out into the future in terms of liftoff date. rules is in line with what the Committee is doing, I don't know. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  And to buttress what Jon just said, one of the memos point that points points.  In that case, the distribution modal liftoff point looks like it's the first quarter of 2016.  My point is mechanical rules with very mechanical inertial rules are not and as a result they push that distribution markedly Which one of these

sure we do either.  [Laughter] MR. LACKER.  I'm not you can even follow a fairly mechanistic as having. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  But the point is that rule and still have a probability distribution for liftoff that is even further out in the future than the statement might be interpreted

and select a rule or set of rules that help guide policy during those any proposed rule.  But that's different from a rule based on its performance at the zero bound.  In a zero-bound environment, will make it very hard to assess the performance or given rule since most of the models and analytics we have aren't well constraints.  Instead we should be prepared to augment the baseline be appropriate in the face of constraints posed by the zero bound.  For with adjustments for balance any particular rule.  Why reject a rule that works well First and foremost, I do not think we should evaluate simple rules or robust rules based on how they perform at the zero bound on interest rates.  We should evaluate how the rules perform in normal times times.  However, this evaluation process might take into account, for example, the probability of a rule leading to hitting the zero bound under choosing important nonlinearities are present.  They appropriateness of any suited for such boundary rules in a way that might example, we might consider augmenting our interest rate rules sheet actions or some other mechanism for making adjustments.  Thus, comparing the implications of unadjusted rules at the zero bound seems to me to be the wrong way to go about selecting or evaluating the desirability of 95 percent of the time simply because 5 percent of the time we may have to figure out how to adjust it?  As I said, it would be informative, however, to get an assessment of how often a

of many competing models, and its optimal control outcomes are almost certainly far different.  Consequently, we must resist the merits of any particular rule by how close or how well it compares with the optimal FRB/US operative framework.  The idea of simple and robust rules is that they well across a range of plausible models.  I don't believe that a good way to robustness properties of these rules is to benchmark them against optimal policy in a even assessing performance in one model. Second, a lesson that is apparent in Keith Kuester's memo is that optimal control policies derived in one model often lead to poor outcomes in another model.  An important motivation for a simple rule is to find one that is robust, that is, it performs well across a variety of models. Model uncertainty is pervasive in macroeconomics.  Thus, we need to keep in mind that FRB/US is just one from optimal if the operating model is something temptation to place too much weight on the optimal control scenarios in FBR/US or judge the value or control path produced by FRB/US.  If we do so, we can make some very big mistakes if ends up being the wrong perform reasonably evaluate the single model or

As President Lacker pointed out, it does particularly forward-looking agents.  Thus, I I see as a tendency to emphasize this rule as an literature, he finds first-difference rules tend to be somewhat more robust As I said, this is particularly the case for models I'd also mention that in the did not perform very actually a better word.  I poorly, for example, in some of the models that rely on more think we should be cautious about what appealing, robust rule over some of the others.  Indeed, consistent with the that, as we've been talking about, the across models than ordinary Taylor-type rules.

puzzled over this point in the economic cycle, we would want to be carrying on an rules in terms of normal times when we are far from normal times.  It's akin that if I wanted to carry around a radio that is the best radio under normal conditions, a model that's got lots of bells and whistles and really takes a tremendous amount and drains the batteries quickly; but that's okay because normally I can plug it in and I find myself on Gilligan's Island where the transistor It seems to me like what you're describing is a perfectly reasonable approach to how we MR. EVANS.  Could I just ask a question of President Plosser?  I'm really the logic behind why, at evaluation of these to thinking I might choose of energy recharge it or whatnot.  However, then radio runs out of batteries within about two hours, and I want to make it last for however long it takes.

think, President Evans, the issue really is about how we monetary policy or strategic framework for conducting monetary policy. you communicate that strategy and how you want to you want to be transparent about that.  I don't think any of us, or else I know of, views any kind of robust rule as a mechanistic rule that we just never will always be times when we deviate.  This may be one of those times that we deviate depends on where you want the baseline in terms of what you I don't want to do and what I policy.  I agree that you don't, but it's nice to be able on which you choose to rest your laurels, so to speak, most of the time and you will deviate.  Then we can debate and argue about what is the for us to deviate from that rule.  That ultimately makes our communications and more clear because then we have to explain why we're doing what we're the monetary MR. PLOSSER.  Well, I establish and create our I don't think you want to ignore both how think about that strategy if anybody deviate from.  There we deviate, but how think your strategy is, and you may have to adapt to that.  What think we should guard against is allowing the current unusual time to guide us in how we think about developing the strategy more broadly for how we conduct monetary there are times when you will deviate.  I'm not suggesting that to have a framework recognize that at times appropriate manner efforts easier doing.  I think that improves the clarity of our communications and the clarity of policy process.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.

you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to thank the staff as well for an rules.  I do think this is a fascinating literature, and FOMC.  It's one that I have tried to contribute MR. BULLARD.  Thank interesting set of memos concerning policy one that very much informs the debate here at the

July 31-August 1, 2012

also done work on the topic.  I have several I'm just going to list them, and then I'll expand on them a little bit.  The good advice on rule.  Accordingly, I think that the I view it now-that it's informing the process, but the Committee does not actually is that much of the discussion and analysis has I think that this is inconsistent with the idea that the commitment to staying at called for by ordinary policy.  I'll expand on that The third comment is that in much of the analysis the ties to done in parts of this analysis, but should be required to map policy is that I would are and how long they the Committee is willing to accept this feature of committing to a model allows many possible equilibrium to myself, and I know many around the table have remarks on the memos. first remark is that it's pretty clear that this literature is not mature enough to give the commitment of actual policymakers to a particular policy policy rules discussion has to remain a step outside the actual policymaking process, which is sort of how commit to a particular rule.  The second comment the flavor of lining up the adoption of a policy rule with the date of liftoff in the policy rate.  This echoes some of the earlier comments. reason the Committee is naming a potential liftoff date is to suggest a the zero bound longer than would otherwise be a little bit in just a minute. household utility are weak.  In my view, policymakers should not be free to choose objective functions arbitrarily as is actions back to the welfare of actual households inside the model.  Comment four suggest evaluating the rule somewhat more holistically based on long-run simulations. Committing to these rules means committing to keep unemployment higher than it would otherwise be in some states of the world.  I'd like to see what those states would last, and ask whether policy rule.  Number five is that in many models in this class, the worst policy is the so-called interest rate peg policy.  Such a policy inside the rate unchanged for years and years, outcomes.  The rules suggested here have the policy

This could be viewed as an additional and much approximating the interest rate peg policy. more virulent-Richard, is 'virulent' a word?

MR. FISHER.  Yes, it is.

MR. BULLARD.  It is.  Okay.

appreciate the consultation there-a much more virulent threat to the rule commitments growth in the economy changes, and I'll give you an example advice on the desirability of the actual policy committee rule.  I think the true range of model uncertainty is much, much President Plosser touched on this. MR. BULLARD.  I economy than the ones discussed in the memo.  I'll talk about that a little bit.  And then, finally, I would like to see even more emphasis on what can go wrong with the policy in the event that the trend rate of of such a calculation.  I suppose the main point that I'm trying to make is that this literature is not mature enough to give reliable committing to a particular policy larger than what is suggested in these memos, and limited set of models, rules that work well in some I want to just expand on what's not in our models. class of models studied Financial crises are not part of this model framework; increasing globalization in which rule to which one might wish We certainly know that even within a situations do not work well in others, but Here are some examples of real-world phenomena not captured by the here: the number two economy in the world is closely tied to the dollar is not in this model; hysteresis in labor markets as occurred in Europe in the 1980s, 1990s, and up to the present day, is not in this model.  Those are all examples of real-world phenomena that are not part of the analysis. These could all have profound effects on the best choice of a policy to commit.  The bottom line on this part is that I prefer that the policy rules literature be used to

July 31-August 1, 2012

a particular rule for actual policy, as that type of commitment could be dramatically in inform judgments concerning the actual policy choices, but the Committee should stop short of enshrining error.

was that the discussion lines up the adoption of a policy rule at the date giving forward possible liftoff date.  The Woodford-type idea concerning commitment credibly from what way to describe this would be rule that calls for an earlier date of liftoff, but committed to keep the policy rate near zero for longer than timeframe would suggest.  For instance, you'd pick Taylor (1993), which would have you Committee nevertheless makes a commitment to stay at zero Woodford is talking about in rule should call for an earlier date of liftoff than the current guidance from I've argued at previous meetings that I do not think such commitments and, therefore, that we should not base policy on them, but the analysis, of course, The second point of liftoff.  To the extent this is true, there would be no benefit from our policy of guidance concerning the to keep the rate at zero is exactly that the Committee would be deviating would otherwise be thought of as ordinary monetary policy.  One to think of current policy as described by a policy that the Committee has nevertheless that raising rates right now, but the beyond that point, and that would be the sort of commitment that that line of literature.  There should be no need to line up the policy rule with the date of liftoff, and in fact, the policy the Committee suggests. are credible allows for perfectly credible commitments.

that ties to household utility are weaker than I think prudent.  The a The third point was objective function assigned to us policymakers is largely arbitrary in this type of analysis.  In the literature, quadratic objective functions can be justified, but the parameters in the objective function would be dictated by the preferences of households in the model and other factors that are inside the model.  So you're not really just free to say, 'I have such-and-such objective as

We care about households and about what In the literature, objective functions can be obtained from first clear. policymaker' because that would imply different on inside the model.  To make everything would be dictated by the policies deliver the most utility to those households.  We should design policies to maximize their utility, not our utility. principles.  They tend to put more weight on price stabilization than typically assumed in policy discussions.  It may be possible to break that result, but the assumptions behind such a model should be made very point that the worst policy in this class of models involve the For models in this group, keeping the nominal interest rate fixed and peg policy.  A very allows many possible equilibrium that are allowed under such a policy are extremely volatile I'm describing, where can happen.'  The policy rules discussed in the memos often call for an approximate where the rate just stays at zero for years and years.  From the perspective that mention this is that it provides another reason coming from the policy rules literature with some considerable caution robust policy. Let me now turn to my so-called interest rate peg. unresponsive to shocks for a very long time is often called an interest rate robust result across models in this class is that such a policy outcomes.  Some of the equilibriums and would be very distasteful from a policy perspective.  One idea about robustness in policymaking would be to avoid those kinds of situations, like the one 'anything interest rate peg I'm describing here, how wise is that?  How robust is that?  Is this not an approximation to the actual worst policy in these models?  The reason I to take the advice because that advice depends a lot on what do you even mean by

What would happen in that case? version of work by Athanasios Orphanides and coauthors concerning the of the 1970s.  My own work with Stefano Eusepi, published in The Review of Economic Dynamics , studied this issue in a DSGE the productivity slowdown of the early 1970s and a Taylor-type policy rule.  The main result was that a productivity slowdown of the same magnitude of the one experienced in the early 1970s in the 300 basis point persistently high inflation rate.  That would explain perhaps about half of the inflation in the 1970s.  Working on that paper made me cautious about thinking in terms of policy rules, which are not appropriately adjusted to changing trends in the performance of the economy.

comment is I do appreciate the work behind these memos.  I do like this a long way get something really convincing out of the literature.  I do not think that the Committee good conscience commit to a particular policy rule based on the literature as it stands My final literature; I do think it informs our policy judgments.  However, I also think we have to go to can in today.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher.

And one of the I have had a problem with, and I have discussed at great length with John Taylor, is this gap.  You and I have had discussions on this, but how do you define an globalized world?  Jim just referred to globalization.  I think that's one of the I'm not sure we properly take account of, and I wonder-and this is a question, again, at this table-about the degree to which we tend to much we can possibly we actually live in. think the subject should be pursued.  I thought I actually enjoyed reading these memos.  I memo raised some very good questions, not only questions about a realhinted at-at least the way I read I understand The question is, how do we develop a rule for the just touched on this-not only are we things whole issue of an output output gap in a issues that not being as sophisticated as other people think in terms of a closed economy when we develop these rules, and how develop a rule, not just against a zero bound, but in the kind of world that It's just not clear to me if we can easily do that.  I Jon did a great job in his presentation.  I must say, thought the Philadelphia time data problem but also about the zero bound.  And it also it-the concern about globalization.  So it is not clear to me that this is doable, but the theory behind wanting to do it.

two other quick points.  On page 12 of the longer memo there was a sentence that impairment of the transmission mechanism would call for all else I wonder about that.  To me, it represents just pouring it on.  And the question is, why affect the transmission mechanism rather than increase the quantity of did catch my eye. I have is that none of this addresses whether these were the right outcomes.  If 1, the rule may have led this Committee to lead to a very low interest rate Just really caught my eye. It said, 'An more accommodative conventional monetary policy than that implied by the simple rules, equal.' not try to accommodation?

The reason I mention all of this-again from a less sophisticated perspective than President Lacker or our other two interlocutors-is that these are simple questions that address in order to be effective.  And then, also constantly asking ourselves, does the rule lead us in the you feel compelled to comment, raise your CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  If hand.  But otherwise, let's hear everybody, and then Jon will make the final comments.  Okay? President Williams.

I would like to thank Jon and the Board, and the Philadelphia staff as and helpful discussions on this topic.  Personally, I find monetary of policy.  Importantly, in terms of responses to changing economic conditions.  Now, the background I will focus on the issue of adapting policy rules calls the 'Gilligan's Island economy,' that is, situations where the zero prediction that from the zero bound, and 5 percent of the time we'll be at so far in my tenure, it has been zero.  [Laughter] MR. WILLIAMS. well, for their thoughtful policy rules to be a useful guide for thinking about the appropriate stance they provide us with a straightforward way to think about monetary policy systematic, predictable materials covered a lot of ground, so in my time to what President Evans bound does constrain policy.  And I have to say, President Plosser, that the 95 percent of the time we'll be away the zero bound is optimistic to me-at least a bigger sample than that. MR. PLOSSER.  Fortunately, we have

conclusions that I think are relevant to our current situation.  First, when faced with the zero for reasons I will explain in a moment.  Second, you are stuck at the zero bound, it is important to keep monetary policy lower for longer MR. WILLIAMS.  In my research with Dave Reifschneider on this topic, we drew two key bound, we do not want to keep our powder dry after

July 31-August 1, 2012

not keep our powder dry?  When you're you can do with monetary policy, the gives us even more incentive to ease policy as conventional monetary stimulus to be operative you keep the powder dry, then we are for longer than a standard monetary policy rule would prescribe?  Well, are helping to keep longer-term interest rates would be without the zero lower bound.  This is exactly as in the optimal commitment policy in the Tealbook.  Thus, in order to easier than a concrete, based on my current economic forecast, rule prescribes policy liftoff about three or four quarters later than a than normal to help the economy recover.  So why approaching the zero lower bound, or any limit on what fact that we may be constrained in the future quickly as possible.  This allows the available for as long a period of time as possible.  In contrast, if giving up on an opportunity to add stimulus, slowing the recovery.  Why do we want to keep monetary policy lower by promising to keep policy lower for longer, we low, and, in fact, closer to where they the same idea compensate for the presence of the zero lower bound, our analysis argues for being standard policy rule on both sides of the zero bound.  You want to be easier going in so as to put that policy easing in place for as long a period of time as possible, and you want to be easier coming out of the zero bound so as to keep long-term rates lower and closer to where they would be in an unconstrained world.  To make things the Reifschneider-Williams comparable unadjusted monetary policy rule.  Thank you.

And a few of us encouraged the staff MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would like to thank the staff for providing us with exceptionally illuminating memos.  They reinforce my own long-held view that simple rules can serve clarity of our communications.  I first promoted the FOMC's use of rules for these purposes in a speech I

July 31-August 1, 2012

a very and learned a huge amount, and Federal Reserve staff have contributed-and continue actual increased markedly. to conduct research on the use of simple rules in monetary policy analysis.  We have come long way to contribute-very importantly to the impressive literature on this topic.  Meanwhile, the use of rules in policy has focus on rules that mirror our dual objectives.  A rule to stabilization of approach in promoting these objectives, I think it is essential that rule we use to inform our policy judgments incorporate a strong enough response to resource economy to move expeditiously back to full employment following a shock.  And (1999) is much more consistent with a balanced approach than (1993), in my opinion. The staff memos highlight important design issues that need to be addressed.  Given our statutory mandate, the memos appropriately key design issue, therefore, concerns the relative weights assigned by the employment and inflation.  Given the commitment incorporated in our January consensus statement to follow a balanced any slack for the for this reason, a rule like Taylor one like Taylor

(1999) rule doesn't incorporate any policy inertia, I believe that a Moderation.  Some inertia serves to enhance public understanding of monetary policy and Given the noisy nature of incoming information, a Rules that embed a much higher degree of inertia may come optimal policy under commitment, but the value of conditional Although the Taylor moderate amount of inertia is appropriate in normal times, like those we experienced during the Great the predictability of its future course. moderate amount of inertia also allows policymakers to minimize the risk of reversals without being seen to be falling behind the curve.  The experience from the tightening episode during 2004 and 2005 suggests that market participants understood the commitment implied by inertial behavior.  In particular, investors correctly anticipated a prolonged sequence of fed funds target changes in the same direction. closer to approximating

July 31-August 1, 2012

fairly limited importance in normal times.  Unfortunately, present from making conditional commitments are substantially Taylor (1999) rule relative to the optimal control glaring in times like these.  They have convinced me that it would be guidepost for our current policy deliberations and (1999) rule does a much commitments seems to have circumstances are far from normal, and I found the memos particularly insightful in analyzing how simple rules can and should be modified when monetary policy is constrained by the zero bound.  They dramatize that the gains greater, and, hence, the shortcomings of the policy are much more inadvisable to use that rule as a communications.  In contrast, a highly inertial version of the Taylor better job of approximating the optimal policy under commitment at the zero bound.  And I intend going forward to use it as a benchmark in making my own assessments of appropriate monetary policy.

I see between this topic and our consensus forecast initiative.  First of all, a consensus forecast will provide a be informed by the use of simple rules as given rule modal outlook or the balance of risks.  Second, we will need and want, consensus forecast, to convey the degree of uncertainty surrounding the modal fan charts.  However, such charts are generally with the consensus forecast reference rule and to consider carefully whether Finally, I would like to comment briefly on the links consideration of the context in which to explain the rationale for the Committee's judgments about the appropriate path of policy.  I expect that these judgments can benchmarks, but mechanistic adherence to the prescription of any rule would be unwise.  There will surely be circumstances where deviations of policy from the prescription of any will be warranted by the as part of a outlook.  This can be effectively done using constructed using stochastic simulations, which in turn require the specification of a policy reaction function.  Thus, if the Committee decides to proceed further initiative, we will need to specify a particular

July 31-August 1, 2012

that rule would be featured prominently-or, alternatively, downplayed-in our monetary policy communications.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.

My questions are going to be about LSAP adjustment.  And want to thank the staff, both Board and in Philadelphia, for the three very useful memos.  I found them, as others I am going to deviate from the trend I have heard around the table going to actually have some questions for the staff, but it is useful to provide a little LSAPs.  And President Williams and Governor Yellen just highlighted the difficulties of benefits of large-scale we are in some sense breaking questions are going to be about trying to use the insights from rules in we should be adjusting this extra stimulus being provided by the MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I here at the have said, quite illuminating. and am context for what my questions are. right now, in particular, a lot of the focus of the policy discussion around the table is about the use of using standard rules when you're at the zero lower bound.  But one of the asset purchases is they are able to offer stimulus, and in that way the zero lower bound.  My order to understand how large-scale asset purchases.

Board memo expresses some concerns LSAP adjustment because there is a view that we should be making up for the idea is that because of the perceived FOMC failed to provide sufficient accommodation in 2009, worried today in 2012 about underprovision of accommodation in the My first question is a narrow one.  The second about underaccumulation of past accommodation.  I think that cost of unconventional policy the and that we should now somehow make up for that.  But my question is, why isn't that mistake sunk?  Why should I be past?

July 31-August 1, 2012

a couple of things, and then I think Dave Reifschneider will was that under certain you guys have derived, you can make an adjustment that exactly and properly LSAPs and allows you to mirror the outcome you would have had under rule.  And we want to emphasize is that there are a lot of other special factors you want to be doing something else in the good and fiscal policy is central to understanding right; you want to LSAPs.  We can list two or three other things where I can well for making an adjustment.  So the answer to the first part of your and properly adjusted rule.  Adjusting but not three or four other relevant things-that I am not so MR. FAUST.  Let me say want to comment.  One important point that we tried to make in the memo assumptions that adjusts for the effect of the unconstrained going on at the zero lower bound that might make present circumstances.  The clearest example to me-but not everybody likes this one-is that fiscal policy in the current circumstance is behaving dramatically differently from how it behaved in almost all of the other recessions, the ones in which that rule was found to be a thing.  We all think that the interaction of monetary either one of them.  You don't want to get only the stance of monetary policy get the stance of overall macro policy right.  And so we would want to adjust for would also want to adjust for fiscal policy.  And I make a good case as question is that it would be great to come up with a fully for maybe one or two special factors, much in favor of.

I will let Dave comment on that, if he wants to, because that is area. The second part of your question is about the references in the memo to filling the past policy accommodation hole. more his

I will start by going back a little bit over the ground that Jon a key issue, which is, what are the benchmarks against which you evaluate is a good adjustment?  One way we would do it is to forget rules and just have a loss MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. did because he raised what

July 31-August 1, 2012

to represent what's a good outcome.  As we pointed out in the memo, if going to follow one of two rules.  I'm either going to follow a Taylor (1999) rule I'm going to follow an LSAP-adjusted Taylor (1999) rule, we could ask which rule would be macro outcomes?  The answer in the memo was that you wouldn't want because the adjustment would cause you to lift off from the zero bound earlier. shock that had kept you trapped at the zero stating the point that John made, which is that Reifschneider-Williams adjustments, we'll call them, make up for you were stuck at the zero lower bound-that you were in a bad state-and if you a better outcome you would do an adjustment to stay easier for longer. function or something you said, 'I'm or better in terms of better to adjust the rule What you would want to do in the face of this big lower bound, is just be easier for longer.  That's just another way of Williams the fact that were trying to get this issue is to say, 'Well, I don't know what loss It wasn't expressed so colorfully in I think how the March memo from John Roberts and Ed Nelson put it was, you were a policymaker who just loved the performance of the economy under, say, (1999)-pick your rule; it doesn't quite really matter-when you never were worried bad shock that sticks you at the zero lower the performance of the from April showed was you had been using asset purchases very aggressively, in fact so aggressively you you were stuck at the zero lower bound, then when you constrained by the zero lower bound, a policymaker who LSAP adjustments.  The formula that the Minneapolis memo had for Now, a different way of looking at function anybody has in mind, or anything else like that.' this version, but suppose Taylor about the zero bound.  Then, you get into a really bound, and the policymaker says, 'Gee, I would really like to replicate unconstrained Taylor rule.  How do I do it?'  What the Minneapolis note that if essentially had made up for the fact that are coming out and are no longer wanted to replicate the hypothetical behavior of the economy under an unconstrained Taylor rule should make those

July 31-August 1, 2012

rule was exactly right in that world.  But what the memo that we distributed LSAP adjustments to be appropriate, and that condition was that the adjusting the Taylor this time went on to say-and the point was definitely made in the Minneapolis note, too-was that there is a condition for Committee had done enough LSAPs to make up for the shortfall.

MR. FAUST.  Before the current one.

Right.  In some sense, had you done enough with LSAPs to nothing in the past you need to make up for, and the economy had been on that path that you would have you could have gone below zero.  But if you are not on that path, if the you do to get me closer to that path? it was, did doing the LSAP adjustment put you closer to that path or you close to the path.  You would be better off not MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. make up for the shortfall, so that when you are coming out finally, there is that wanted to have been on if Committee hadn't done enough, the question is, what can The other way of putting not?  And the answer was, no, it didn't put doing the adjustment.  These are the examples that we looked at.

and the MEP had basically managed to replicate (1999) unconstrained and you are a policymaker you gap, then you wouldn't want to make the It might be that those programs might not have made up the gap because you might gap.  Alternatively, if you don't (1999) says, you might be just asking yourself whether this is a good outcome inflation.  Alternatively, you can go ahead and make are more than offsetting adjustments you would make along the lines was discussing a few minutes ago.  I don't know if that helps. If one felt that the two LSAP programs what would have been possible under Taylor who thought that that was just the right thing to do, then you would want to adjust.  But if didn't think that they had fully made up the adjustments. have thought they were too costly a tool to use to make up the care what Taylor for unemployment and a good outcome for the adjustments, but there that President Williams

into my second that you and Jon hit on two separate issues, which are important to separate. of the economy right now might well be different from what has been well want to adjust for it.  Vice Chairman of interest right now is considerably lower than it was five years ago. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Well, that is going to lead pretty nicely question.  I thought One is that the dynamics true in the past, and our policy reaction function might Dudley has highlighted this as well in one of his speeches, that there might be reasons to think that the natural real rate separate point about the fact that interest rates are constrained by zero.  If LSAPs-and we just got a memo from New York we should be able, in principle, to provide as you want to use.  And then, second question. not just another adjustment like fiscal policy because, unlike fiscal policy-which I at-we actually get to do something about monetary policy.  Tomorrow the alternative A versus alternative B.  It is useful to a guide to thinking about that choice.  How should I do Then, there is a we are able to do an arbitrary amount of saying we can do a lot more than I thought-then much stimulus as we could by lowering interest rates, whatever rule there is a question of how do we do the translation?  And that leads into my LSAPs are watch and wonder Committee is going to be asked to think about have a monetary policy rule to serve as that?  That's my question.

a couple of things.  First of all, on fiscal and monetary gets to actually implement it; it's a matter of what the appropriate either one is.  And that appropriate stance, in my view, is appropriately jointly fiscal policy is operating very differently than at other times, the dual mandate normal, and then behave appropriately.'  It is a you were talking about, and I MR. FAUST.  Well, let me say policy, it's not a matter of who stance of determined.  If doesn't say, 'Pretend fiscal policy is operating as joint determination.  Now, that is a separate point from the one agree that those should be separated.

July 31-August 1, 2012

has dwelt on those in which the simple adjustment for LSAPs confidence in those is kind of difficult.  That is why the staff has been rule they like.  We are not LSAPs, but, rather, we are in favor of-and I think the memos support and how they call for different adjustments at present.  The LSAPs is one such factor, but I don't think it's unique or special.  Finally, everybody has their own view about whether the use of LSAPs so far has effects of the zero lower bound.  Indeed, if we were all confident on this, I LSAPs as being such that the effective lower bound no implication. On your point about, what should we do?  I think a lot of people around the table have said that in light of the current circumstances-the person sitting next to you maybe it as much as anyone-the simple models-say, would be exactly right-are perhaps adequate in normal times.  I'm not sure they are so adequate now, and so to have attempting to provide information to allow lots of kinds of adjustments that would allow people to make judgments about where to go from there, whatever policy against adjusting for this-thinking about a lot of factors presence of around the table probably completely offset any think we would have a simpler time around the table-our discussion might be quite different if we could just condition on the past use of has

What I would add to that goes back to the forecast targeting Jon was making in his presentation, and it links up to the consensus forecast discussion later in the meeting.  One way to look at the issue is to say, 'What does the the most likely outcome for real activity and inflation going forward and how Let's say it's balanced.  Let's say coming down to 5½ percent or MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. point that that you will have Committee think is does that link up to the dual mandate?'  Suppose the Committee looks at the projected paths for, say, the unemployment rate and inflation conditional on what was in the statement last time, and determines, 'Yes, that is consistent with the dual mandate.' inflation was a little bit above 2 percent and unemployment was

July 31-August 1, 2012

midpoint of the Committee's longer-run normal range.  Then you might that's fine; that's an okay strategy.'  If it wasn't showing that, if it 2 percent, and unemployment staying right there for further policy approach is that when you are dealing LSAPs or the MEP or whatever, you have to ask yourself how effective they are going to be there are costs associated with them.  There is a second cost-benefit analysis that you look, the expected outcomes for real activity and inflation.  And then ask, is that outlook consistent with the dual mandate?  Is that outlook satisfactory?  And if it with which I can do which the benefits from using that tool outweigh its costs?  That would be how I your question. something, which is the say, 'Okay, that's balanced; was showing inflation running persistently below persistently above, then you might say, 'Okay, that's grounds action.'  Now, of course, the other complication with this with and if would have to do because it is an unusual tool.  But stepping back from that, I would first conditional on some policy, at I'd isn't satisfactory, do more.  Then the question becomes, do I have a tool more and for would answer

As you'll hear over the next couple days, I'm sympathetic to you're saying about the forecast-based approach.  One of the reasons we do like rules is is not easy.  One of the reasons forecasts, but different models might differ on that, and way, but we hope a more robust way, to get at that.  So a give-and-take between the forecast-based approach and the rules-based I heard from you is that you're leaving policymakers on their LSAPs.  Is that the right take-away? MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. what that formulating forecasts of medium-term inflationary pressures we're using models is to try to deliver rules are maybe a little more mechanical I think there is more of approach, and the take-away that own in terms of how to adjust rules for

The point we made in the memo was that there are a number of going on right now.  One of them is LSAPs, and that suggests we adjust MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. unusual circumstances

July 31-August 1, 2012

to face tomorrow-or not me, but the more of this particular kind of action.  And the Is there a way to adjust a rule to provide some guidance about whether or not to take MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Right.  I have a choice voters do-of deciding whether or not to provide question is: that choice or not?

Here's the answer that I think is most appropriate to that.  The whole literature attempted to distill some truths that are out there across all the models and them in a rule.  That's great.  Now, if we were in a position right now to distill some truths that we could all agree about-did we fill the hole with past LSAPs; have a simple rule that get into a bit of a stone soup situation if we say, 'I you come up with an adjustment that encompasses myriad factors, the response by the policymakers who would like help could be, 'I don't believe that. and B and C.  It's a it's not amenable to a simple I am particularly reticent to recommend:  'There's this one adjustment on we have a bit of theory and that only holds in certain models.  It's not robust across go MR. FAUST. simple rules imbed about current circumstances are labor markets functioning in a standard way?-then maybe we could would be appropriate.  But in my view, we really like simple rules if we just adjust for A-and then B-and then better adjust for C and D.' And then we've left the simple rule behind.  And from the standpoint of the staff, there's a problem that if appropriate What's in that adjustment?'  And then we'd go back to discussing A complex situation, and maybe we should go back to Einstein here; characterization. which models, but at least we have some theory that tells us what that number would be.  Let's

July 31-August 1, 2012

You that's we are trying to do; we're working pretty hard on that, as are It's a complicated topic, and we'll report back as frequently as we have something ahead and add that one in.  We'll leave the other particularly dangerous because could goad the staff into providing more information about each of these things that we're saying one needs to adjust for.  Well your staffs. useful to say.

BULLARD.  I lots of adjustments, but it wasn't clear to me, and means that, 'You shouldn't do an adjustment and, therefore, I'm some unadjusted rules.' these other factors?' and then talk about lots of adjustments.  But it's not clear to me that, therefore, you should look at unadjusted results and at these you know that some particular way.

What I would say is there are a number of adjustments that we MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. can sign, and I think that almost all of them go in the opposite direction than the LSAP

And get back to Jon's philosophical point that we're definitely not using a simple rule any and we are delivering other analyses, such as optimal control, which we can do in we could do other analyses; we could put out with all sorts of adjustments.

That's one reason we're so queasy about the can do some back-of-the-envelope calculations on things-which we have done-such as, if the equilibrium funds rate is not 2¼ but is 1½ or 1¾, and if the previous policy shortfall is a certain amount.

I have my own view, which is I would take I think captures the data and think seriously about what the optimal I want to think about robustness, I would think of this approach seems best aligned with being responsive to our advice.  Now, that does raise a getting at.  The way I heard it was-and some overly tuned to the It does seem like there have with the best, simple, robust type of seems overly ambitious.  I thought this was really possibilities.  I kind of the best-looking model that policy is within the context of that.  But if as a collection of models, which then has to be evaluated, as the memo suggests, along the lines of forecast-based targeting.  That mandated goals, and I wholeheartedly support that type of question, which President Plosser was sort of others might have mentioned this, too-well, what if these policy rules are

To some extent want in read the Philadelphia memo quickly, but my staff advised me that the Philadelphia memo was careful in looking at a wide variety of models that, in fact, seem to fit the data pretty well. I have is:  Jon, did you find different prescriptions coming out of the I heard in your own presentation?  I would have thought that as the same conclusions, but I'd be interested in characteristics of very interesting and important question to ask because it could be costly.  One question I immediately asked my want to contemplate?'  Because it's not obvious how many it's a little ad hoc as to how many of these models or how much dimensionality do we the space of different viewpoints on how the economy behaves?  We have to take a stand on that. I pretty One question that Philadelphia model than what you expanded the models, you would see many of any differences.

It was very broadly consistent.  The main difference really is that we was MR. FAUST. didn't address the probability of hitting the bound under the various rules, and including that a nice addition.

The days when I think of myself as an econometrician make me wonder you were going to bring these other models to the table and say a little bit about how I get to throw in some bad model projections, and that can distort how this And, Jon, I suppose that must be in the kind of work that you were doing.  You MR. EVANS. whether, if the data speak to that, you would want to use something like method of moments to weight those that are most informative about the data and down-weight others.  Otherwise, it's just completely uniform and ad hoc: comes out. would let the simulations speak to that somehow.

Andy and John, that do various things Bayesian approach to deciding which models are good and to coming up with a rule general sense.  The general conclusion that some of these rules do the at the results, but also from more formalized approaches rules.  Now, it is true that the results are sensitive to the collection of you start with, and that's very important.  And the models in the Philadelphia memo were models with a little FRB/US thrown in, which is a little different than the model, I guess.  I carefully didn't say across all kinds of models.  I said you'd like to see.  All pretty rudimentary across, but we'd like to MR. FAUST.  But there are papers, including by like taking a that performs well in some pretty well across a bunch of models comes not only out of an ad hoc approach to running rules in a bunch of models and looking to computing robust policy models all modern DSGE classic academic DSGE across conventional models, but that doesn't span the kind of diversity that of these models don't create financial crises.  All of these models still have financial sectors, labor sectors, et cetera.  So the robustness results carry have a wider range.

any summary comments? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Do you have

I think it's a simple topic, as illustrated.  [Laughter]  One of the I just mentioned by Andy Levin and John Williams on the robustness of simple rules says for a group of rule they all agree on.  And I really wanted to finish up with John as this process went on. MR. FAUST.  Well, papers in the conclusion that because of the strength of the results, it should be easy policymakers that have different views of the economy but similar views on the objectives of policy to come up with a providing some additional perspective on that quote from his paper, which I found more and more amusing

The remainder estimate that about $2.6 trillion could be purchased over the next about two-thirds of this capacity in Treasuries and one-third in agency MBS.  Of course, the uncertainty involved in this type of exercise is considerable.

Purchases of $2.6 trillion in securities over two years would imply a pace of about $110 billion per month in net new purchases.  In addition to purchases associated with the current policy of reinvestments and the MEP, the total purchases represent a substantial pace-particularly over coming months-and as shown in the bottomright panel, one that we have never before sustained over such a long period.

MR. POTTER.  That's correct.

I guess I have a two-part question maybe for you and maybe Bill dealer survey, did you allude to what new tools those might be?  You did might be some comparable tool to what the Bank of I'd like to know MR. PLOSSER. English:  (a) in the mention in your comments that one thing England instituted.  I'd like to know what was mentioned in the survey.  And (b) if, in fact, New York or the Board is exploring new tools, and obviously what things are under consideration?

What we did is we took the exact phrasing in the June minutes-the Fed might be doing, and that's where as well. MR. POTTER. exact phrasing, no words added or anything else-and then the dealers were free in the free response section to tell us a little bit what they thought the they mentioned the Bank of England program.  I think the Chairman mentioned it in his press conference

Is that under active consideration and study or are there other things considered that would be classified as new tools? MR. PLOSSER. that are being

I'm curious about the degree to influenced by things like an expectation that Hilsensrath was right or an expectation that this newsletter seems to have more insight than another, and MS. DUKE.  So do we then impute it back to some rule? which we think they're being in his article kind of talking to each other about the rules that might apply.

MR. POTTER.  That's right.

I had two other questions.  The next one has to do with the gross issuance It would seem to me it's easier to project the issuance in the the MS. DUKE. particularly in the MBS market.

I have confidence in the short MBS market being quite confidence.  There is model error in the prepayment speed, we buying because of the reinvestments, and the conditioning assumptions are in practice from what we assume.

I think I heard BIS when other rates went negative. MS. DUKE.  Thanks.  And then my final question has to do with what about the

Interestingly, what I've heard about that is the reason they charged the get all of the money that was coming through. MS.

I was going to ask about, 'new tools' without definition-but you have some examples.  We were window.  The Bank of England (BOE) has its Funding for Lending. and vast differences between the Treasury and the BOE and the central bank, it does make me wonder are well known, and there's a drift to what we do and an understanding, but that's comment. MR. FISHER.  Well, Governor Duke touched on something throwing out a phrase referred to the discount Even though there are vast legal differences Exchequer and the relationship between the about the value of the probability of additional policy action when they don't even define what new tools are.  It's just a buzz word, and at least it leads me to question its value.  The other tools that we have my you to look at, Simon, or I look at the numbers, we've seen I'm trying to get my arms wrapped around the The question I have-and this is just something maybe for someone on your staff-relates to the equity markets.

I didn't see that in the memo that you circulated, MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you.  And my be useful to tell us something about how this hypothetical projections for income but that would be interesting to think through.

I think that most people around this table should be able to work it out a LSAP and then will go down because of reserves.  And then the fine details of it are you went for the whole $2.5 trillion, it's likely that that would produce a deferred asset MR. POTTER. little bit.  Income will go up in the short run from a large we have to pay interest on a much larger amount that if toward the end.

I had staff look into that for alternative A in the Tealbook, and the remittances to the Treasury at a positive value.  Clearly, the cumulative amount increases some.

item 3, the CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you very much. We are now at economic situation, and I'll turn to David Wilcox.

[Laughter] MR. WILCOX. 3   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  From time to time, as all of well aware, there have been proposals to televise the transparency of monetary policy.  Whatever the pros or cons of the idea on substantive grounds, I am relieved that we're not on the air this week, going up against the Olympics, because a ratings match-up or-what would be most and other indicators that we received over the intermeeting growth of real PCE over the second half by The spending data period led us to mark down our near-term projection for real GDP growth.  On the household side, real retail sales are now estimated to have been about flat, on net, since February-a weaker trajectory than we had expected in the June Tealbookand household sentiment has been more downbeat than we had foreseen.  In response, we have trimmed our forecast for the about ¼ percentage point.

Second, another a technical measurement issue content for the going forward.  Third, other aspects of the annual revision seem earlier assessment.  To give one important example, the first quarter of this year was hardly was right on our expectation, giving us no additional underlying detail about the GDP Friday's employment report, our updated near-term forecast growth is a little softer than we showed you last week, and more noticeably In came in at 1½ percent, ½ percentage point higher than our July Despite the stronger top-line number for second-quarter GDP growth, we inclined to draw any production.  In fact, our initial assessment is that these data point to a bit economic July forecast.  Three main considerations inform this judgment.  First, a substantial part of the upward surprise came as already reasonably well aligned with sales, stock up further.  Accordingly, we would not materially change our projection for inventory investment GDP growth from this category over the second half of the substantial part of the upward surprise reflected pertaining to federal defense purchases that we think has no signal pace of spending fairly consistent with our personal saving rate often revises substantially in these reports, but as is evident from the plot in the bottom-right panel, the rate in the revised while the rate in the second quarter reason to modify the profile of household spending that we showed in the July Tealbook.  All told, pending the receipt of accounts and especially for GDP weaker than we had in the June Tealbook.

essentially no change to the staff growth this an improvement in our financial conditioning assumptions that is attributable to the continuation of the maturity extension program that your June meeting (and that we had not factored into our June and usual multiplier effects that result from the Turning to the medium-term outlook, we made forecast in 2013 and 2014 despite the downward revision to real GDP year.  This reflects in turn partly you announced after projection).  Indeed, in 2013, the improvement in financial conditions largely offsets the weaker momentum in spending downward revision to output growth in 2012.

fiscal policy assumptions in this growth in aggregate demand next year (and a somewhat We have made no material change to our forecast.  Specifically, we continue to assume that domestic fiscal policy will be a substantial drag on the smaller drag in 2014), but that the more severe consolidation implied by current law-the infamous 'fiscal cliff'-will not occur.  In addition, our supply-side assumptions are the same as in June.

report and the other data that we employment estimate is that about half of the deceleration in private year that we see in can be attributed to seasonal, weather, and other temporary genuine loss of momentum.  This Turning to the labor market, the one labor market have received since the June Tealbook have come in a little worse than we expected. We have continued to assess the influence that the unusually warm winter weather and recession-related distortions to seasonal adjustment have had on the data; at present, our best payroll employment between the first and second quarters of this the official numbers effects, with the other half representing a deterioration in the underlying trend is a little larger than we had expected in June, and combined with our weaker near-term GDP projection, led us to lower our forecast for monthly job gains over the second half marginally relative to the June Tealbook.

outlook for real activity also led us to nudge up our panel of 2013; indeed, the small decline that we are forecasting stems from the anticipated expiration of the Emergency Unemployment year.  In 2014, the expected faster pace of gap slightly. The weaker tenor of the projected path for the unemployment rate, which is shown in the top-right the exhibit.  With a pace of real GDP growth that is expected to run about in line with our estimate of potential output growth, we anticipate little reduction in the unemployment rate over entirely Compensation program at the end of this aggregate demand growth is sufficient to narrow the unemployment rate exhibit.

As year that is slightly higher than our June forecast; further out, the The inflation outlook is summarized in the two middle panels of the PCE price inflation-the middle-right panel-has expectations, and we have made essentially no price inflation-the middle-left panel-has stepped down recently, led by retail energy prices that in turn reflects sharp declines in crude oil prices through June.

They could do this simply giving in to gridlock-whether by strategy, or by inertia, or by accident-because assessed this possibility in the 'Risks and Uncertainty' section of the fiscal contraction (which we assume would affect household and business confidence) would add about a end of 2014.  Second, the future market is difficult to predict with any degree of confidence, are a number of residential construction and house price for the U.S. economic outlook, as Steve Kamin will I forecast.  First, we remain concerned that fiscal policymakers may choose economy off the by if they do nothing, the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts will expire and the more abrupt reduction in spending mandated under sequestration will take full effect.  As in June, we have Tealbook and estimate that the resulting also adversely percentage point to the unemployment rate by the evolution of the housing and as Andrew Figura discussed in his Monday briefing, there downside and upside risks attending our forecasts.

Markets refocused on the fact that Greece's track, and that by September, the EU of providing Greece exit from the euro area.  Investor sentiment was also damped by public statements following the summit that raised questions as to whether Spain would be able to take advantage of the provision for direct European recapitalization of weak banks. Finally, concerns mounted that deteriorating finances among Spain's provinces would further undermine the fiscal position of the central government.

Indeed, an open-ended commitment by the ECB to intervene in could be a real game-changer and while the situation is sense is that when the ECB meets later this week, it will authorities.  Accordingly, and with sovereign spreads in Italy and cut, the words, which came the day sparked a dramatic market rally actions by the markets to cap yields on Spanish and Italian bonds, perhaps coupled with direct financing from the European rescue facility, substantially improve the outlook for Europe.

And although are probably close to full employment at this resource earlier this up, but we still see it remaining close to central bank targets. Even if the outlook is by no means bright.  The resource slack, projected for the next the emerging market economies (EMEs) point, the sub-trend growth we are projecting for them should also reduce utilization somewhat.

To conclude, misery loves company, but off if the rest of the concludes my prepared remarks.  David and I will now be happy to take questions.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Questions?  Vice Chairman.

I have a question on food prices.  Can you give us some of the increase?  And related to that, how does ethanol fit into this?  If corn VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. sense of magnitude

go up, does ethanol get priced out of the market, and so more corn actually gets used for prices consumption for food?  I'm just trying to understand how this works if prices keep going up.

Referring to your first question on the magnitude of food prices, at least Research Bureau (CRB) aggregate of daily food prices-has MR. KAMIN. one aggregate-the Commodity gone up roughly 20 percent from early June.

I am trying to think about it more in terms of the dollar where it's a little bit over get a sense of whether it is a big shock or a little shock, at really high corn prices. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. magnitude of the shock.  For example, think about it as we do oil prices $1 billion per penny on gasoline prices.  So if corn prices double, what does that really mean for disposable income?  I'm just trying to with an automatic equilibrating mechanism like ethanol production just evaporates because you can't sell ethanol know the answer in terms of dollar magnitudes.  What I do know the level when the drought began to point, smaller.  We are calibrating our projection off futures prices, so yield estimates from the USDA.  The pass-through is pretty limited because in retail food part.  And the other thing that is important to a fairly lengthy period of time.  So this is not effect year and in the early part of next MR. WILCOX.  I don't is that we had much bigger run-ups in grain prices in 2010 and in 2008.  Although the level of grain prices now is higher than it was then, the jump from emerge to now is, at this we are taking our judgment from those who are placing real bets on this.  We are also monitoring crop prices the commodity share is a reasonably small keep in mind is that the pass-through occurs over like crude oil prices getting into gasoline, which happens pretty quickly.  We think that the is going to show up in retail food prices toward the end of this year.

The elasticity of demand are going to do well, and, in the aggregate, the few tenths this year, and by about 1 percentage point over the four quarters year, in response to these developments. MR. WILCOX.  We think that farm income is we think is less than one.  So prices are, we think, going to go up by more than quantities go down.  Those farmers who still have a crop to sell farm sector is going to have a positive boost to income.  We have raised our food price projection by just a of next modest shock at this point in time? country, at the aggregate level for retail food prices, at this point-with a lot of uncertainty VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So this is a pretty MR. WILCOX.  As hard as it is for, obviously, millions of farming families in the middle of the still surrounding what the outcome will be-this is a reasonably modest development.

Lockhart. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President

I you picking up any indications that it is already here? employment, investment, contract renewal, or procurement, have you any indications that there is a discounting of the possibility of it that is already affecting in advance of the deadline? MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  A question for David Wilcox.  If understand your discussion of the fiscal cliff, you assume it will be avoided in the baseline, but you treat it as a risk to the baseline.  Are That is to say, in terms of seen behavior

July 31-August 1, 2012

It might become increasingly ran a first-page article about the WARN Act indicating that there is a lot of controversy employers will be required to send out notifications, I think it is 60 days in any sort of discounting back to now.  We have and households will have that same assumption for the moment.  It is going to be MR. WILCOX.  We haven't allowed for any of that. difficult to maintain that assumption.  For example, I would note that this morning's Washington Post about whether advance.  At the moment, we haven't allowed for maintained the assumption that nothing is going to happen in advance of the election, and that producers something that we will have to evaluate on an ongoing basis.

fiscal a big step up in fiscal contraction, even in the baseline, because we have law.  And we have the year, as under That's quite a bit of current-law contraction going into force.  In addition, we have replaced by an equivalent set of federal spending cuts that at the end of this year than would occur under reduction built into our baseline.  The most pieces that are incremental to the spending reduction are the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, extension requires affirmative legislative action.  So if the Congress fiscal restraint that is the biggest single piece that will go into effect in Let me just be really clear about what we assume in the baseline and what is in the cliff scenario.  We have the 2 percentage point temporary payroll tax cut expiring, as under current emergency unemployment compensation program expiring at the end of the current law. the automatic sequestration being accrue over the period between now and, I think, 2022.  That represents a less abrupt restraint on aggregate demand on New Year's Eve sequestration, but there is quite a bit of spending prominent which are scheduled to expire, and in our baseline projection we have assumed that those are extended.  To happen, that does nothing, those tax cuts expire.  There are a number of other pieces of occur, too, but the expiration of the tax cuts the cliff scenario that isn't already incorporated in our baseline assumption.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans.

chart might be useful, if anybody has a follow-up question.  I thought you included I thought was very interesting was your calculation of the range.  I've got a different tabulation that I'm interested in, though, and it is related to you could see that inflation tops out at about 2.3 percent.  And it is just convenient that your PCE prices forecast chart has as its upper bound.  Inflation is controllable, and yet I have trouble thinking about it and fully embracing But it seems clear from this chart and your tables that the standard that 2.3 percent is range of a 70 percent interval.  When we have an inflation objective of It is really well controlled, and we should expect to visit periods above 2.3 percent more often than optimal control path and see 2.3 percent, I well, that has got a lot of perfect foresight embedded in it and it abstracts from uncertainty. general distribution of inflation outcomes.  Or another is if you wanted to mean adjust this process so that 2.3 percent really was interval, it would be a lot like the inflation projection that you have It would be more like targeting 1½ percent.  Is that a reasonable way to think through some you have there would be welcome. MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  A question for David.  And your forecast summary some nice tables in the Tealbook this time on probabilities of particular events and risks that we could face.  A particular tabulation that probability that inflation would exceed 3 percent.  That is pretty low in terms of risk, in the 5 to 10 percent looking at the constrained optimal control path-and Jon Faust's discussion had it in his chartswhere that actually seems to be what stochastic, it is not fully what that really means. deviation of the inflation forecast is about 1 percentage point, which means just about the top of this 2 percent, how likely is it that we would be able to avoid inflation above 2.3 percent? not very we might really take on board.  When I look at the say, But that outcome is not that unlikely in a way to think about this at the top of a 70 percent here. of those issues or tensions?  Any thoughts

have a lot to add to your observations.  The one important point I would make is that the staff projection is constructed against a backdrop in which we need case under the constrained I should note that there is no particular virtue in that specific rule, capture the center of gravity of the Committee's thinking, we would be rule.  We could array for you exactly the same view about the economic forces driving the macroeconomy using a different policy I feel no special affinity or fidelity. MR. WILCOX.  I don't that a mechanical assumption for monetary policy.  So we construct that using the estimated outcome-based rule.  And I think that is the central explanation for why, at least over the period that is shown here, our inflation projection is a little lower than is the optimal control simulation. and my position has always been that if the Committee gave us some indication of an alternative rule that would better very happy to adopt that fundamental underlying assumption, and we would show different projections.  These are conditional forecasts based on a particular specification of a rule to which

Should another 15 percent movement in prices.  The price sharp, but, Vice Chairman Dudley, as far as the inflation impact-if your question-it is a lesser weight in the system. MR. FISHER.  Just to Vice Chairman Dudley's question, I think food at home is about 7½ percent of PCE and about 8.6 percent of CPI.  And then, if that's another 5 percent, which is highly attenuated, as pointed out earlier, and takes to work its way into the system. pointed out, rationing has not rationing begin to occur, you might have movement has been very that was

That is above the 1.1 billion barrels we the best intelligence that we can get.  We are given that we have lesser demand; Chinese demand, which has been running about a day, has been to fill their strategic reserve, offset by the decline in consumption is kind of a wash.

By the way, the best and only estimates can really had at the end of 2011.  The Chinese have been building their strategic reserve.  They are aiming for 300 million barrels.  They have 280 million, by chock full of oil.  Iran has about 40 million barrels floating inventory.  So the expectation in the industry, 400,000 barrels here and in Europe, so it futures curve, the expectation in the industry is very little pricing power as run their course.

want to follow Lockhart's question about the issue of the fiscal cliff.  I thought his questionwe see today already economy because people are anticipating a fiscal cliff and changing their you would interpret the current data versus addactually occurs.  I thought his question was, how until it MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have two questions.  One, I up on President excuse me for paraphrasing-in part has to do with the fact that if the data reflect a slowing behaviors now, then there is a question of how on effects that would come when the fiscal cliff are you parsing that assessment?  Or are you assuming that the fiscal cliff is irrelevant actually occurs?

what I had tried to indicate to President view that no matter what are not going to assume any sort of fiscal cliff confidence effects or anything like given that I live inside the and am subjected to orders of magnitude more discussion about this than I think country and, to be sure, households are; it is hard to discuss.  Setting that ours is the best assumption.  But it is something we are going MR. WILCOX.  The latter, for the moment.  But Lockhart was that we are not going to be dogmatically dug in on the happens we that, until it happens.  It is a little hard, frankly, for me to judge, Beltway businesses around the aside for the moment, I still think to have to watch.

guess the point is that if you believe there was already some behavior occurring, then you might question whether or not that is you to draw your fundamental forecast lower than it might otherwise have been, and it MR. PLOSSER.  I anticipation or preparatory leading could change the way the forecast profile looks.

I just wanted to clarify the underlying going into this and how changes in that might affect the forecast. MR. PLOSSER.  Yes.  I assumptions that are

going to be open to doing the best that we possibly can to take evidence.  There is an epistemological question; I just don't know exactly are going to have to be sensitive to. MR. WILCOX.  We are on board any sort of how we will measure that effect going forward.  But I think it is completely fair that that is something we should think I always find interesting in the you talk about what the implicit assumptions are underlying the Severe Spillovers left me a little puzzled, so I'd got a response where GDP is off is going up to over 11 percent. effect just from trade channels. I am curious about is what your thinking is on that scenario?  Were the results the model add factors that you have played in, and, through what channels MR. PLOSSER.  Yes.  It would be very hard to do, but it's something we about.  Turning to my second question, one of the things Tealbook are the alternative scenarios that get played out.  I had a particular question about one of them.  In most of them, different scenarios, but the European Crisis with like a little explanation of what went into that.  You've something like 5½ percentage points and the unemployment rate At the same time, we know that we are unlikely to get that much What per se playing out, or were there did you impose the spillover effects that led to these very sharp deteriorations in that scenario?

You are entirely right that if you just took a standard kind of model where proximate effects of some shock, it would not necessarily give you the you see in that scenario.  There is a question, I MR. KAMIN. you put in the very most amount of spillovers, which are very severe, that how do you even start to model something so complex and so far-reaching?  And so we, like

July 31-August 1, 2012

Lehman Brothers and its aftermath. is, in some sense, our model for how a severe financial shock can reverberate through the In practice, first of all, what we have done is put in extremely large shocks in Europe. you a large contraction in output.  We have augmented that with confidence shocks in give you a further decline in confidence there.  In addition to that, we have an you a very substantial trade effect from Europe on the United you have the contraction in European GDP as well as the increase in the dollar. Lehman Brothers-we have augmented the with substantial, although not as great, credit spread shocks in the United States that yields.  Plus, I believe, we have you get is a scenario of the types of think most analysts in the business that are thinking about modeling this cataclysm, take our cue-some general guidance-from what happened during That system. These are exogenous, upward shocks to the level of credit spreads in those economies, and that gives Europe that upward shock to the value of the dollar or, conversely, a downward shock to the value of the euro.  Those different shocks give States because On top of that, recognizing how well linked financial markets are in the United States and Europe-and that is something we also saw during trade effects are offset, to a small degree, by shocks that reduce U.S. Treasury some additional, albeit smaller, confidence shocks in the United States.  And then, the rest of the model responses are indeed endogenous.  In sum, what outcomes we would expect to see if things truly went adversely in Europe.

To give me an idea, when you say you increase credit spreads by a large give me an idea of what the number is, and (b) across all securities or over certain MR. PLOSSER. amount, (a) types of securities.   I'm just looking for a ballpark.

Yes.  For Europe it is a 400 basis point credit shock. MR. KAMIN.

corporates? MR. PLOSSER.  To sovereigns or

July 31-August 1, 2012

a net of 300 basis points.  And then, a 200 or 300 basis point shock to corporate spreads offset by a roughly yields.  The model doesn't have separate credit spreads versus equities, but it is assumed that the same shock to interest rates increases equity risk premiums and leads to a reduction in equity prices commensurate with the credit spread increase, both in United States. MR. KAMIN.  This is actually to corporate spreads over safe German securities.  Then, the German security lowers by 100 basis points, so you get in the United States, it is 50 basis point downward shock to the Treasury channels for that we have just been talking about also basically comparable Europe and the good answer.  I appreciate that. MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you.  That is a CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard.

I could just follow up on that question.  I have often wondered about scenarios.  And so in that scenario, the paths I guess, so you are assigning less than 5 percent of probability to that event? MR. BULLARD.  If these forecast confidence intervals and alternative all go outside the 90 percent confidence bands.  There is only 5 percent on that side does that mean that

I would interpret that as meaning this is an MR. KAMIN.  David can correct me, but extraordinary event that is well outside the typical stochastic bounds that we have.

at the picture.  It is actually so far outside that it outside. MR. BULLARD.  Well, just looking would be at the 99.9 percentile, so it would be way

MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  The seemingly normal distribution.

you took our forecast track record literally, that correct.  I would also say that one of the things that we learned in 2007, sometimes our imagination is not sufficiently rich to encompass MR. WILCOX.  I think that if interpretation would be 2008, and 2009 was that

July 31-August 1, 2012

confidence intervals, which are generated over what years? everything that can happen, and that these period, the last 20, 25, 30

These are taking shocks from the 1968 to 2011 period. I'm MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. MR. WILCOX.  Okay.  I'd say that a lot of bad stuff happened over that period, but not sure that the kind of cataclysm that's involved here with the European crisis with severe spillovers is really well captured in the error track record.

constructed from the period of the Great Moderation. MR. BULLARD.  I would summarize that as saying that a large part of the confidence intervals are

MR. WILCOX.  Yes.

going to look a little constricted compared with amount of uncertainty that might be sitting there. MR. BULLARD.  And, therefore, they're maybe the true

I'd put it slightly differently.  Not to keep citing work I've done with John, but a paper that we didMR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Actually that

MR. WILLIAMS.  That's okay.

yes.  This is a paper we did about a year or so and three statistical are still in, but started in 2008, is way outside the you'd get from a whole set of representative models.  And our conclusion extreme tail events.  Either that or we're unbelievably unlucky, your pick.  Well you can be both.  [Laughter] MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  You'll like it, ago in which we took six different models-two DSGE models, FRB/US, models-and found that the episode that we probability bands that from that was that the standard models that the whole profession has been using just underestimate the probability of take

LACKER.  Yes, in both cases we're unlucky.  We're unlucky to have the bad MR. model.

The way I would put it is the confidence intervals that are in also comes back to the point that the part of its SEP assessment of risk of saying that risks are elevated.  Also, as There's a strong the idea that risks are more elevated now than under ordinary error bands. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. the Tealbook are very wide, but when you take into account some of these infrequent but really devastating, rare events, they're probably too narrow.  It Committee makes in I think Simon can say, it is what we do with the stress test and things like that. effort to try to get across circumstances.  That might be indicated by those sorts of

Thank you.  As you remember, the Committee authorized a step toward using a a communication tool.  We had two rounds in which people were asked to I'm going to give just a very brief exposition of that forecast and how we got much more extended discussion tomorrow after the policy decision.  I'm called 'Material for the Consensus Forecast Exercise.'  If you turn to gives the forecast for the SEP variables.  It shows the comparisons with the median and with the July Tealbook; recall that the Tealbook was put to bed before the got to this forecast.  Normally I think what we would do in a steady state group of participants and for people who had policy that, number one, the output and inflation very different from the were forced to adopt the consensus policy, and CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. 4 me and the staff to do an experimental consensus forecast, which would be consensus forecast as submit comments. to it, and there will be a going to use the handout page 1, that basically June SEP NIPA revisions, so those are not included in the Tealbook forecast.  Let me just say a couple words about how we would be to start with the consensus forecast from the previous meeting.  This time, of course, we didn't have a previous forecast.  So what we did was look at the June SEP numbers, particularly at medians both for the entire assumptions closer to the consensus.  The thinking was forecasts for people whose view of appropriate monetary policy was consensus might be quite different if, in fact, they

July 31-August 1, 2012

the consensus forecast ultimately will have to be used to rationalize whatever number two, that policy it is that the Committee adopts.  That being said, the medians for the two groups were about the same for the SEP variables, and so that's where we started.

used the delta Tealbooks to take a first stab at updating the SEP forecasts.  In other was that as a first stab, the difference between the Committee and the staff would the same in July as it was in June.  Second, we took into account the comments that got back.  Those comments basically suggested that people had taken down slightly their real were a little bit more pessimistic on unemployment, but a slightly stronger economic growth.  Also during that period, on Friday we got the NIPA revisions, what we have that is a little bit more optimistic on economic growth and unemployment slightly higher inflation numbers.  If you turn to the third page, you'll confidence bands.  The green dots You can see that there have not been major red line and the green dots, you see that GDP has been marked down slightly in the near term, and unemployment has been marked up Given that, we updated using two pieces of information.  First, we just between the June and July words, the idea be roughly we activity forecasts and correspondingly they had not changed their inflation projections very much.  We took that on board.  As you know, we also solicited a second round of comments.  We got a few asking for outlook for which were a little stronger in the second quarter, and we took that on board.  So here is a projection than the Tealbook, with see the same forecasts shown with fan charts using 90 percent are the central tendencies from the June SEP. changes since the June SEP, but comparing the growth slightly.  Inflation has been marked up a little bit in the near term.

I do you to.  This baseline forecast is predicated on the policy assumptions from the June at least through late 2014 and the MEP.  It seemed Now, we did one other exercise, which I don't want to go into in great detail, but want to alert SEP- maintaining the low funds rate

July 31-August 1, 2012

assumptions, first, because arguably the rate is above target for the entire horizon.  But more choice we might make at the meeting.  For instance, if we have two or we'll want to come into the meeting with two or three different possible action we decide to take.  As an exercise, we did two things. you turn back to page 4, exhibit 2, first we simply took the projections of inflation and GDP and calculated an output gap-shown in the bottom-using a simple data just to see what that would imply for policy, and the different you'll see, for example, that the outcome-based rule has liftoff The red line is inertial (1999), which rises more slowly, of course, because of the inertial feature.  Now, these and then allowed the economy to is in the green dashed lines, basically the late 2014 liftoff plus at three alternatives.  The first is a mid-2015 liftoff.  The second is a $1 alternative A-about 60 percent Treasuries and distribution of purchases is the same as in LSAP 2, that is, it's broadly bottom of page 2. worthwhile to also use some alternative policy consensus forecast doesn't meet the condition that President Evans mentioned-inflation is below target and the unemployment generally, if we do use this kind of approach for communication, we'll want to have forecasts conditioned on whatever three things on the table, forecasts, conditional on whatever If growth and unemployment transformation between the unemployment gap and the output gap.  We then applied various alternative rules to those variants are shown there.  Notably early in 2014.  Some of the other rules have takeoffs later in that year. Taylor are static policy prescriptions.  There's no feedback into the economy.  Again, just for illustration, we also did forecasts in which we chose the policy deviate from the baseline using FRB/US to calculate the deviations.  Exhibit 3 shows the alternative forecasts for five different policies.  The optimal control and the consensus forecast, the red line, is the baseline-it's the MEP.  Then we look trillion LSAP that follows the specifications in 40 percent MBS, and the spread across the range of maturities.  This is described, by the way, on the

July 31-August 1, 2012

LSAP that we looked at was a greater-duration LSAP, in which, as we see in the purchases are Treasury securities and one-fourth are 3- to 30-year range, more like a longer-term MEP-type of program.  And because it takes out more duration, LSAP of similar size that is spread across the entire maturity I'm not going to go through these in detail.  I just wanted to point out that it's possible also alternatives, which would be subject to discussion in the The other bottom of page 2, three-fourths of the agency MBS.  But in this case the Treasury securities were purchased in the so it's it's more powerful than an spectrum. to calculate not just a baseline, but Committee.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes?  Sorry.

with greater duration is a little bit light in 3-to 6-year going to replicate the MEP in terms of the amount of duration it takes out. MR. POTTER.  So the LSAP purchases.  It's

It's a little light? MR. FISHER.  Sorry?

It's a little bit light in the 3-to 6-year range.  It won't be like LSAP2.  Is Bill? MR. POTTER. that right,

I believe that it is longer.  The MEP buys in 6-to-30, but then there's an MR. ENGLISH. adjustment because of the sales.  But it's aiming to be similar in terms of duration removed.

I apologize.  So the greater-duration program is like the of purchases.  The shorter one is like LSAP2; it's spread broadly the entire range.  I'd be happy to take any questions on this.  Let me just suggest a few you want to make reference to any of this in your go-round, of course, feel free it's obviously not required.  Tomorrow we'll have a fuller discussion of this forecast process, I'll ask you, as we would in a real application of this, you are comfortable being described by this consensus forecast.  That would be part of CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. MEP basically in maturity across things.  First, if but in which we'll do two things.  One is whether

July 31-August 1, 2012

if we were to use it.  The concerns or objections of those who are conference.  And then we'll do tomorrow is just have a general discussion of whether we want to change it, and so on.  But let me now take any questions the discussion we would have not comfortable would have to be described in the minutes or in the press the second thing continue the experiment, how we might just about the construction of this.  President Kocherlakota.

this you just said is, in steady state, the conditional on whatever policy choice has been the Committee in the given meeting, is that correct? MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  You may choose to defer question until tomorrow, but my understanding from what goal would be to have this consensus forecast be made by you would explain what you anticipate happening, given the you've made. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes, at least within a reasonable range of the forecast made by the Committee.  That's how policy choices that

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Okay.  Thank you.

Lacker. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any others?  President you said are reflected in the weighting MR. LACKER.  Mr. Chairman, I apologize.  I didn't quite understand what about the extent to which the policy parts of people's submissions that you used in combining these.

Again, this was a one-time thing where we're starting up forecast has already been argument, that there are a certain expectation about not agree with that path CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. using the SEP.  In the future we'll start with whatever consensus developed.  But the question is the following:  Suppose, for the sake of N people who agree on the consensus policy path, and that they have economic growth, inflation, and so on.  Now imagine someone who does and has a very different outlook for the economy conditional on their own view of appropriate

July 31-August 1, 2012

in practice it didn't make any difference. monetary policy.  It wouldn't be appropriate to average that person's outlook with the middle of the Committee because that person basically dissents from the whole forecast, but it's academic because about the policy path as a I'm not restricting my forecast of GDP by assuming that all the shocks equals one path.  I'm just giving an unconditional forecast of MR. LACKER.  No, I understand.  But, I interpret what we say forecast of our future policy setting, not as an assumption that we will hold to.  In other words, we're not restricting it. come out in a way that the policy GDP and an unconditional forecast of policy.

But you're not giving an unconditional forecast because your own view of appropriate monetary policy and that may differ from your own of what the Committee will do. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. you're using personal forecast

LACKER. But I'm also using my own model.  Everyone is using their own model. MR. So everyone has their own equations in their head, and they're forecasting a lot of variables.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Right.

aside policy, you wouldn't throw out someone's GDP forecast MR. LACKER.  Setting because they differed on core inflation, would you?

you're assuming. are two possible ways to do this.  One is to assume appropriate monetary policy.  If your you to do this, which rules.  What do you think will happen in each case?'  That's a different way to do I had, which was the appropriate monetary policy assumption, what you wrote CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Again, it's a question of what policy There view of appropriate monetary policy differs radically from the center of the Committee, then will not agree with the forecast of the center of the Committee.  Another way we might consider, would be instead to say, 'Here are two or three different possible policy paths or policy it, but given what

July 31-August 1, 2012

your best unbiased forecast of what maybe it was, but it's not the same issue. down for appropriate monetary policy presumably was not will actually happen, or

Excuse me, Mr. Chairman.  Your exhibit 3 was an effort in part to sort you might get if you came back to the Committee and said, 'Okay.  Here are actions.  Give me back your forecast of GDP and inflation under the MR. PLOSSER. of replicate what three scenarios of policy condition of those assumptions of policy.'

I think these pictures here basically accept the deviations from that forecast.  It would be a different exercise by are three or four different policies.  What do you get the same results.  President Bullard. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, consensus forecast and show asking each person around the table, 'Here think that would lead to?'  You wouldn't released to the public?  Is it table 1? now getting into material we can discuss tomorrow, I assume that what would be released would be only the forecast associated with the policy MR. BULLARD.  Mr. Chairman, what would be CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We're but decision that the Committee actually took at the meeting.

MR. BULLARD.  And what about these fan charts?

charts alone are worth good to have. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  And the fan charts, yes.  The fan quite a bit, in my opinion; they are fan charts. MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  So the basic vision is that two things would go out.  There would be a table, and there would be some

exhibit 1, and that would be it. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You would get the first lines of table 1, and you would get the fan charts in

MR. FISHER.  You wouldn't send out exhibit 3 or exhibit 2.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No.

July 31-August 1, 2012

MR. FISHER.  Thank you.

chose one of those [No response]  Again, tomorrow we will have a fuller for our economic go-round, and I'll CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Not unless the Committee actually alternative policies.  Any other questions? discussion of this and how we will proceed.  We're ready start with Governor Tarullo.

you, Mr. Chairman.  As everybody knows, I've been an you can tell from the discussion of rules earlier today, I've been fabulously around to that view.  Nonetheless, I thought that I figured the only way I could get away with using I'm going to do.  Specifically, though, I would very briefly five propositions about which I'm relatively certain and I hope there would be wide agreement among the Committee, and then by posing four decisions, in some cases sooner and others perhaps not until later. aim here is to see if we can establish at least a workable baseline for what most of us MR. TARULLO.  Thank advocate of relying less on prepared remarks and more on fomenting a conversation in these meetings, and as successful in getting everybody to come should adhere to my own injunction.  So I prepared remarks was to go first, and that's what like to try, probably quixotically, to frame at least some of the conversation for the rest of the afternoon by identifying where questions on which I'm a good deal less certain, but the answers to which I think would significantly inform policy My dual agree on and to help focus our collective attention and discussion on matters where there is significant disagreement and/or uncertainty.

by saying they're not particularly I think they're still significant and would be an important starting point for agreed on.  First, the economy is bogged down.  It's First, the four propositions, and I'll preface them profound, but thinking about policy were they to be widely unable to develop enough self-generated momentum to attain sustained, above-trend economic

July 31-August 1, 2012

The occasional bursts of upbeat news during this period have likely been the maximum effects of monetary and fiscal stimulus or idiosyncratic this last point, the recovery has been further hindered by confidence effects from a number of additional factors, notably the European travails and end of this year.  Third, the downside risks are substantially weightier than on important fronts and household deleveraging are in some cases still more in the nature of of rapid pickup any time soon.  At the same existing from the known unknowns such as the euro zone and the fiscal cliff or I already suggested but I think it's worth stating good data points over the next seven weeks would not materially alter the growth consistent with recovery from the deep recession that technically ended more than two years ago. temporary byproduct of factors, such as Okun's law payback, rather than the beginnings of sustained, strong recoveries. Second, notwithstanding and uncertainty more recently fiscal tightening, with the low but not zero possibility of fiscal strangulation looming toward the upside risks for the next several quarters.  The indications of improvement such as housing prices improvement in second derivatives.  Even where absolute improvement is detectable, it is both modest and not consistently distributed.  Factors such as the shadow inventory overhang of houses taken off the market until prices firm and the 13 million homeowners who still have underwater mortgages make it hard to tell a story time, the potential for serious adverse effects from Europe remains, well beyond the drag that the ongoing crisis may have placed on business confidence and expansion.  Fourth, these first three propositions combine to make the economy unusually vulnerable to external or political shocks, whether unknown unknowns.  And fifth and finally, as more explicitly, a few significance of the first four propositions.

I think are important for economic, including monetary, policy year or two and on which I am somewhere between moderately Now for the questions decisionmaking over the next

July 31-August 1, 2012

general economic recovery?  Or putting the question in a slightly accelerating improvement in housing the most effective use available for recovery efforts?  I've been struck by the amount of recent in qualifying the Rogoff-Reinhart hypothesis recession and slowness of recovery, as in the Bordo-Haubrich paper that perspective in finding that homeowners with consumption even more than standard wealth effects on housing and mortgages in 2009 and 2010 error asserted by many at the time.  But I'm less certain whether, given economy more generally, that and housing problems as a cause rather than a symptom remains the better and very uncertain.  First, is a significant recovery in the residential housing market necessary and/or sufficient for a stronger weaker form, are policies directed at of limited resources academic work that focuses on the particular effect of the collapse of the housing marketwhether work from a macroeconomic perspective on the severity of the builds on other studies, or from a microeconomic high levels of housing debt may reduce would predict, as in Karen Dynan's recent paper.  All of this has reinforced my sense that the failure to develop a comprehensive set of policies was, indeed, the policy all that has happened since, both in the housing market and the treating mortgage policy.

a significant amount given actual takes us so close to stall speed-to shift my Second, what is the magnitude of the effect of my second proposition, that various international and political factors have made the path to recovery even muddier?  And this relates actually to the dialogue between Charlie Plosser and David Wilcox a few minutes ago.  That is, how much faster do we think the economy would be growing were the dark clouds of the euro zone problems and dramatic fiscal uncertainty to disappear from the horizon?  My intuition is no more than two- or three-tenths of a percentage point, which is rates of economic growth because that amount

is not so much as to suggest that all would be well in the metaphor in an intermodal way-but counterfactual case.

interest rates, high unemployment, and other anecdotal level, which includes both conversations with people thinking few muse aloud as to whether people need to change their assumptions about the come to increase savings regardless of present wealth levels. Third, how likely is it that household saving and spending patterns have been changed by the persistence of sluggish economic growth, low factors?  We all expect saving rates to bounce around quite a bit, particularly in uncertain times, and they have.  So it's very difficult to develop an empirical basis for modifying conventional models.

I don't have a lot to add about the intermeeting data except that there reports from the Fifth in diffusion indexes and other data would suggest. about firms slashing payrolls or dramatically cutting back on spending. MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The recent data have economy slowed in the second quarter and is beginning of the seems to be a bit of a disconnect between some of the data and our District, which aren't nearly as soft as the fall Our manufacturing and services sector indexes both plummeted in July, as did a bunch of other ones.  But we don't hear One possibility is that the weakness is broad but shallow, and so changes in diffusion indexes make things look gloomier than they are.

businesses would recover enough to warrant accelerating their spending commitments without resolution of a emanating from Washington and Europe.  However, one make a case that some of the current slowdown stems from the sense that a could be resolved in the next year or two.  This might you get to a time at which a significant greater the value of delaying an irreversible commitments than it a year ago.  In Europe, for example, negotiations over ex post bailout year, or we might make Looking ahead, it is hard to see why consumers or confidence significant measure of the uncertainty could conceivably significant degree of policy uncertainty seem paradoxical, but, as a general matter, the closer amount of uncertainty will be resolved, the commitment, all else held constant.  So it could be that the anticipation that uncertainty could be resolved soon is making it relatively more attractive now to defer spending did maybe half a year or funding and ex ante surrender of sovereignty might be completed next

I'm not sure how seriously to take these alternatives, but it is just worth thinking about because of the unexpected nature of the slowdown that we have seen this first half of the year.

expecting headline inflation year, though, rather than remaining below target at 1.8 percent.  I'm guess I will have to think about Looking at the real growth forecast, the Tealbook is calling for an increase to around couple of years.  I have been wondering about whether growth will, instead, a while.  I'm not sure we can rule this out.  In the middle of year, we began talking about this, about whether we are returning to an extrapolation of the a new, lower trend line.  I read the evidence since then going back to your proposition 1, Governor Tarullo, and I'm not so sure whether that All things considered, our forecast is fairly similar to the consensus.  Our economic growth and unemployment rate forecasts are within a tenth.  We are to return to 2 percent this not quite sure whether that is an essential difference or not.  I that. 3½ percent in a remain stuck around 2 percent for last pre-recession trend, or, instead, tracking as favoring the new, lower trend line view.  And I think the premise that we are 3 percent underlies premise is warranted.

guess the question of the degree of slack in the economy, which is the way we have fourth question, Governor Tarullo.  That was the subject of a it was as well as papers by President Williams pointed out that the rate at which the same for those who have been unemployed six I been discussing it, is related to your recent memo from President Kocherlakota, in which he said he is now persuaded that wrong to assert that the level of long-term unemployment implies less effectiveness for monetary policy.  He cites the comments of President Williams at our last meeting, San Francisco Fed economists. unemployed exit from unemployment is about the

San Francisco Fed economists have found that if the rate of exit unemployed for less than six months-were to return to pre-recession levels, then overall unemployment would fall to about 6 percent, suggesting that elevated unemployment is mainly attributable to the depressed exit rate from short-term unemployment.  All of these observations are said to contradict the broader impairments in labor market effectiveness.  I, frankly, was disappointed by President Kocherlakota's apostasy.

are two interpretations of the observed negative relationship between how long a job-the observation that for a exit is lower the longer that you have been unemployed.  And that employed by the San Francisco Fed economists that were cited by Presidents The alternative interpretation is unobserved heterogeneity among differ in their probability of finding a job, independent of how long they exiting, and some have a higher probability of given cohort is the average of the exit rates of those many months after having become unemployed.  The observed exit rate given cohort falls over time because the share of those remaining that have low exit rates represent a lower share of the Both of these explanations for negative duration dependence-pure There someone has been unemployed and their likelihood of finding given group that becomes unemployed in a month, the probability of group has been unemployed.  One is pure duration dependence, that the real probability of exiting from unemployment is just a function of how long is the approach Williams and Kocherlakota. the unemployed.  People have been unemployed.  When a group of workers becomes unemployed in any one month, some enter unemployment with a lower probability of exiting.  And the observed exit rate for any who are still around that for a increases.  Those with the highest exit rates leave successively and unemployed over time.

The framework is relatively workers-but it is able to capture a lot of the dynamics of found.  The data duration dependence in average exit rates is almost entirely attributable to role.  The framework highlighted by President Williams and others, average exit rates decline sharply up to a duration of six months and are relatively flat exit rate types during the first six months of being unemployed.  Thereafter, and that is consistent with exit rate that President Williams cited. Economists at the Richmond Fed have formulated a simple framework that nests both approaches.  This framework can be used to estimate the contributions of unobserved heterogeneity unemployment.  The simple-there are just two types of duration dependence.  Allowing for more types can be done but doesn't appear to alter the results or add much.  Applying this framework, here is what our economists have indicate that negative unobserved heterogeneity.  Pure duration dependence plays only a minor matches the observations on duration dependence namely, thereafter.  The framework attributes negative duration dependence in average exit rates to rapid job finding by high it is mostly low exit rate types that dominate the pool of unemployed, the flattening in the

And this is true even though the average exit rates at comparable amounts for those who have been unemployed on average for a you just take the pure duration dependence view, it looks like all exit rates A large portion of the initial increase in the unemployment rate in the Great Recession was due to a sharp increase in the inflow of low-exit-rate types.  Exit rates fell for both types of workers-low-exit-rate types fell relatively more all durations fell by while and not.  So if

And the persistence of high unemployment low-exit-rate types, relative to the decline in the exit rate of high-exit-rate type. decline in exit rate to similar magnitudes, speaking, the results indicate that the poor performance of labor markets in this recovery tied to the prevalence of exiting from unemployment.  That is all this calibration can tell you.  You can debate means about mismatch or structural damage, or the like.

This is prompting postponement or deferral behavior as opposed to outright reversal of plans suggests to me some potential for pickup if-and this is a big 'if'-the air Again, nothing really surprising in that picture.  The reduced visibility isn't a new observation. What did get my effect that businesses are businesses accordingly.  That is to say, businesses are institutionalizing their labor and capital strategies to an expected environment of quite limited visibility and heightened uncertainty, and the adamancy around this view was notable.  It is the concern that the business community is increasingly impervious to stimulus delivered through low interest rates.

As an example, GDP year than it did in the first half of last year. broader context, the news of the intermeeting period has caused me to forecast for GDP forecast for unemployment.  Consequently, my growth is stronger than the baseline forecast of the Tealbook and slightly GDP growth in my forecast, this year, I believe that would likely corroborate the Tealbook's judgment on the outlook and would lead Tealbook stands today.  But at this point, I economic growth is not the most likely scenario.  I will use the comments to explain why my outlook is more optimistic than the Tealbook and disappointing reports on the economy, including a significant downward revision to the history of GDP with the annual developments of a suggests that we may be in a little better shape than we were a year growth has faltered less in the first half of this Drawing, in part, on this make modest, rather than substantial, downward revisions to my near-term growth, and a small upward revision to my forecast for economic stronger than the proposed consensus forecast.  With the stronger the unemployment rate declines to 7.7 percent in 2013 and 7.4 percent in late 2014.  My forecast for inflation is a little above the Tealbook path and very similar to the consensus forecast.  While I see reason to continue to expect a pickup in growth in the second half of the data coming in over the next couple of months will be telling.  Continued weakness in the incoming data me to revise my outlook to be closer to where the think the Tealbook's weaker remainder of my just a little more optimistic than the consensus forecast.

I expect a pickup in the pace of recovery this year. from my District auto dealers suggest some desire to rebuild Broadly, there are three reasons that First, the auto sector, which plays such a large role in business cycle fluctuations, appears to be holding up rather well.  Inventories remain lean relative to sales, based on the average inventory-sales ratio, and anecdotes

July 31-August 1, 2012

District report that their businesses are still recovery does seem to be abating.  We are now seeing steady increases in housing Zillow.  While a important support to the economic recovery. commented that with unemployment and home prices now credit to both businesses and consumers has been improving, which will and consumer credit have both been Loan Officer Opinion Survey generally are seeing some abatement of the financial headwinds to the recovery. inventories.  For the nation, both auto sales and production rose solidly in June, and a wide range of small- and medium-sized manufacturers in my seeing decent orders, spurred in part by the strength in the auto industry.  The second reason I expect a pickup in the second half is that the housing headwind that has been holding back the pace of construction and reductions in inventories.  Importantly, it also looks as though prices may have finally really hit bottom, based on the indexes ranging from CoreLogic to modest pickup in housing won't directly add much to GDP growth, it will help with consumer sentiment and spending, which will provide more In fact, one of my directors recently stable, consumers are more confident about replacing their aging vehicles.  My third reason is that the availability of support an increased growth rate of spending.  C&amp;I loans increasing.  Perhaps more importantly, the July Senior showed that banks continue to report easing their lending standards for most types of loans.  So it looks as though we prices points to a stable rate of rose a were quite stable this year.  They saw no signs 2 percent. Turning to inflation, the recent news on consumer underlying inflation of 2 percent or a bit less, depending on the measure.  The median CPI little less than 2 percent in the three months ending in June.  While this rate represented a slight decline from the preceding three months, my staff found that the distribution of inflation rates across all the non-energy components of the CPI of anything like the disinflation we observed in 2009 and 2010.  So I have left my inflation forecast largely unchanged, with core PCE inflation just slightly below

July 31-August 1, 2012

economic growth, unemployment, and inflation is a little differences don't seem to be large enough to be with my forecast we do make progress on accommodation.  As I just mentioned, uncertainty surrounding my forecast is considerable.  In light of some of off of the fiscal cliff or a risks to my forecast are to the downside for economic growth and to the recovery for the remainder of this year and next.  The risks Overall, while my forecast for more optimistic than the proposed consensus, the very meaningful in light of the uncertainty surrounding the outlook.  My forecast is very similar to the version of the consensus forecast that includes an extension of the forward guidance on the federal funds rate to mid-2015, which means that reducing the unemployment rate without additional policy though, I realize that the the recent weakness in the data, and with the potential for a fall meltdown in Europe, the upside for unemployment.  I think the next couple of months will shed some much-needed light on these risks and the pace of the surrounding my inflation forecast remain balanced.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

My views have not Regarding Governor Tarullo's five propositions, I don't have any disagreements with your characterization.  Today economic meeting, and the downside risks continue to increase.

I have to say that I am not entirely surprised by complacent about the actions in the summer and fall of 2010, and then again these have been beneficial, the headwinds facing the U.S. liquidity trap period following the financial crisis, with huge fiscal and think we simply we need much more aggressive policy actions than we analysis of policy rules and make a strong case that further accommodation employment while keeping inflation within a few goal.  But we have hesitated to embrace these prescriptions.  I think what is holding repeating the 1970s economic experience if inflation were to pick up.  I think that resource slack is quite narrow.  If resource accommodation, it seems to seems puzzling to me.  After several years of this, it can't be and prices are not accelerating.  The economy simply faces very strong would be addressed well.

For some time I have thought that we have been overly pace of the recovery.  Yes, we took strong in the summer and fall of 2011.  While economy during this global uncertainties piled on top, are still proving to be just too powerful.  I failed to take on board the evidence that have taken to date to overcome these headwinds.  The Tealbook's the consensus forecast alternative policy scenario can produce markedly better outcomes for tenths of our us back are fears of we are putting too much weight on the possibility slack were that narrow, our $3 trillion balance sheet, combined with our late 2014 forward guidance, would represent an excessively large degree of monetary me.  But if this view were correct, it is simply amazing that inflation isn't much, much higher, and, in fact, rising.  That happenstance that wages headwinds that call for strong levels of accommodation, and I think that most of the answers to Governor Tarullo's questions about how we should think about the economy

if we were to provide more accommodation and then see if, in fact, inflation were to take off.  I don't think it would.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I must say, after listening to President Lockhart and Can See Now.'  I don't think anybody could argue that they can see more clearly now than they going to be a bright, sunshiny day. MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I took a different approach with my CEO contacts and with my board of directors. President Evans, what popped into my mind was that very old song by Johnny Nash, 'I Clearly did before.  It is not asked the following question of every contact I spoke with, 'As you understand your cap-ex or payroll?'  And to a person, from a 32-employee-sized 'no.'  And let me just quote the need to be able to expand certainty of our costs.  The only thing we Let me quote a 32-employee firm. temporary employees will be utilized.'  President Lockhart pointed out a stimulus when it was applied.  And it is very dual mandate, a single woman or man who runs a who feels that we are the problem.  One very important point, Governor Tarullo, is that is that a one-year fix of the fiscal situation-however and have some immediate impact-does not I monetary policy, is there anything further the Federal Reserve can do that would impact desire to expand domestic company to one with over 1 million employees, the answer was CEO of Wal-Mart.

Business planners plan cap-ex and payroll expansion over three-year cycles; they don't plan it they have to take a longer-run view.  And, again, to a person, regardless of board table, I am uncertainty-and it seems to be intensifying-and that the issue is not access to capital. Someone else just pointed out-I think it was Sandy, in what I must admit was a brighter-eyed outlook than I share-that we have seen an expansion of C&amp;I and other loans.  I don't hear complaints about the cost of capital, nor do I hear

I will omit, by the way, what I had prepared, which is to point out that year to date, that single-family permits rose at a pace of 35 percent through May in the negative from our external balances, which I think is the most we are the leading exporting state.  Our exports were down 2.8 percent year.  So, in macroeconomic terms, I don't expect a lot of 'umph' to a bit of clarity with regard to the fiscal cliff, as we like to think about it.

Virtually every sector, the retail sector, or the nonprofit sector, talked about how their firms and their businesses are restructuring the way operations, hedging themselves against risks and uncertainties, so that they survive and do well in this environment.  That restructuring is continuing to go on, and I think that it will continue for some time, and that has clues for us about the economy.

In the face of this uncertainty, we should for households to hold back on purchases goods through much of the rest of this year.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The 10th District economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace.  Consumer spending has been stronger than expected because of stronger auto sales, and energy activity continued to fuel the District economy with higher energy prices leading to an uptick in crude oil drilling.  The recovery in residential real estate markets strengthened further with stronger home sales contributing to increases in housing permits and the value of only modestly in July, but contacts were more optimistic about future levels of activity. Expectations for future production and shipments held steady, and the orders rebounded after hire more employees and increase capital spending over the next six months.

And while bumpy, the housing recovery continues to progress, which is an encouraging of this deceleration in economic growth is difficult.  The combination of unusual weather, seasonal adjustment problems, and some payback for the robust rebound in auto sales following supply chain disruptions, is likely one cause.  But I uncertainty and caution, from risks to the outlook coming from Europe policy.  Businesses in particular, but also households to an extent, seem to be acutely these risks and are, therefore, acting cautiously.  In terms of the outlook going forward, I have reduced my gradually building recovery ahead.  As such, I see modest improvements in the unemployment rate at a bit faster pace than in the Tealbook, and long-run target over the forecast horizon.  Thank you.

Vacancies in the District are about 30 percent above the increases as a result of the drought conditions.  District home sales substantially from last year:  15 percent in Louisville, 7 percent in Little Rock, 21 percent in Memphis, and 19 percent in St. Louis.  Approximately 98 percent of District bankers rate commercial real estate conditions as either fair or than lower peak last reached in November of 2008.

That did not materialize. year's slowdown and market turmoil has not matched the magnitude of what occurred last According to the St. Louis Financial Stress Index, the level of stress experienced last much larger than what we have at this juncture, at least so far.

I caution, however, that last talking about a 75 percent recession probability in the This year. summer and last fall was summer's GDP revision was actually a shocking event in the macroeconomic forecasting community.  We didn't get that shock this time around.

I'd turn for just a few minutes to Governor Tarullo's excellent comments and around the table:  Some people say that the trend growth rate is high, but that there restraining factors that are going to last for years and years.  Other people would say is lower at least over the medium term.  That's one way to reconcile from the EU, the government actions?  I think there are.  Monetary and fiscal policies are a gorilla in your living room with your family hanging around.  It's much better if the gorilla gorilla is jumping up and down.  This makes everybody in I thought assumptions.  Is it a bogged-down economy?  Certainly so.  I've tried to think about that as a lower rate of trend growth for the U.S. economy over the medium to long term.  There is a lot of the rhetoric are many that the trend growth rate some of the things that are said here.

On the question of whether downside risks are larger than the upside, I like to go in this direction.  For instance, a lot people are talking about a are not being anticipated right now.  Maybe it's a we could get a lot of inflation out of our monetary policy.  I think we are also upside risks as well.  I don't think we really know the finer I agree with that. the family very nervous. again, I'm not so sure bond bubble.  If interest rates should happen to rise, I would say that that would surprise a lot of people and cause disruptions in ways that question of whether certainly could.  So there points of the distribution of risk, and I don't like to put too much weight on trying to characterize those tail risks.  We're certainly vulnerable to additional shocks.  I do think better data would be very helpful.  I'm not sure it would alter these basic points.

Is housing recovery necessary?  What I've tried to say on this going again in order to have a robust recovery.  The notion of a that the bubble collapses, and there aren't any incentives to restart the whole process are about 50 million U.S. households If you took as the steady state the 60 percent loan-to-value ratio for those that United States, and you think of households as trying to get back to that going to have to pay off about $3.7 trillion.  That's about one-fourth of one It On the four questions: issue is that the rhetoric that we have about a housing bubble is inconsistent with the notion that the housing sector has to get bubble is that led to the bubble in the first place.  You wouldn't want to re-inflate the bubble; that would be poor policy.  Moreover, the extent of the debt overhang problem, even though we talk about it a lot, is somehow understated in our discussions.  There that have some type of mortgage debt.  From 1970 until the crisis, they would run a loan-to-value ratio of about 60 percent.  After this crisis has occurred, those loan-to-value ratios have gone to 90 to 95 percent. have mortgages in the steady state, they're year's GDP.  That kind of adjustment just can't occur in any kind of business cycle frequency. has to be thought of in decade terms, and it's just not realistic to think that all of a sudden

is going to jump back on the housing bandwagon when you've got loan-to-value It could be that the old 60 percent ratio is not the right ratio and now permanently carry loan-to-value ratios of 90 to 95 percent, but I don't good reasons why they wanted to keep their loan-to-value ratios I think that housing is improving and that prices have bottomed, but I don't think that we you add together It's a big factor; I don't I would describe the economy as having a lower everybody ratios of that magnitude. people will be willing to see that happening.  There are lower. should expect rapid improvement in that sector.  Also, it's not just housing, although sometimes people say, well, housing is kind of small, and it can't just be housing.  But if through the input-output tables all the other industries that feed into housing, the overall effect is actually quite large and accounts for a large fraction of the entire crisis. expect it to come back soon.  For that reason trend rate of growth.

fiscal cliff situation and the uncertainty that?  I'm not sure about the fiscal cliff, and I put less weight on fiscal policy than at the table.  However, in my opinion, the EU crisis is evolving into the most significant our time.  Unified Europe is the largest economy in the world.  You're altering the entire path of the entire European project going forward.  In comments, it looks like it's 'too big to Lincoln's surgeon can say, 'I'm going to do everything in my power to save the combined with the chaotic United States and to Japan, which are I really think the concerned about that.

If you had year or 18 months or something on a about years and years at very low interest rates.  Then you do get people in their savings opportunities really are and how going to have to save.  They have to alter their behavior.  This starts to alter am concerned I am concerned about getting into years of very low interest rates and the effect on saving in the U.S. Have household savings policy may be unwittingly business cycle policy that called for low interest rates for a business cycle time scale, then our models make sense.  Our models start to not make sense when we start talking the middle part of their lives looking toward what much they're really the entire structure of the macroeconomy instead of just mitigating a business cycle downturn, which would be the normal event that the theory is aimed toward explaining.  I about this.  The policy has been appropriate up to now, but many growth potential been reduced?  I think it has, and this explains why inflation has typical models that we use here have going to go lower; that hasn't occurred.  I think that's calibrated to stop that from happening.  It also explains growth.  If you view the output gap to be large and because your estimates of trend growth in the United States.  I will just say one other the way it handled this crisis.  However, if you Sweden's GDP path, it had a one-time downward shift, and it never did recover to the Has remained near target instead of dropping precipitously.  The constantly been predicting that inflation is because policy has been appropriately why we're seeing such slow economic maintain that view, it seems to me that rapid growth should be just around the corner you're a long way away from the trend and the historical behavior is that the economy snaps back to trend.  That hasn't been occurring.  I think as that continues to not occur, then you have to start reducing thing about that.  The poster child for recovery from a financial crisis is Sweden.  Sweden had a crisis in the early 1990s, and it is often lauded for look at

I feel compelled to respond to, but the first one is, of course, David Wilcox's attack I will just say that if it was in my household, and the FOMC meeting complete against dressage, the FOMC meeting would lose big time. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  There's been a lot of previous remarks that on dressage.  [Laughter] was trying to my fear.  [Laughter] MR. WILCOX.  Precisely

apostasy, to use President Lacker's term, at I wanted to open with Governor Tarullo's questions.  I would say that agree with all five of your opening propositions, Governor Tarullo.  As President Bullard and about what are we being bogged down gets to your last question about structural damage.  As my remarks will highlight, I be the first to admit really feel about the issue.  In fact, I'm going talking about the role of supply and demand shocks, Mr. Chairman, in shaping where we to talk about the consensus forecast memo much at this time.  I think about it in the next go-round. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I'll touch on my the end of my remarks, but I President Plosser talked about, I think the tension is really by, and this think there are differences of views about that around the table, and I will that I will probably sound a lot more certain than I to be are today.  I'm not going the consensus forecast is really a communications tool about policy.  That's one of its main roles. I'll talk you go back and look at the SEP in January 2010, FOMC participants thought that rise to an unemployment rate of around 7 percent by the going to miss this forecast by a wide Now, this miss has come even though I think monetary policy has certainly been more If appropriate monetary policy would give fourth quarter of 2012, and it seems likely that we're margin.

years than the Committee thought it would be in I think most two factors:  Either aggregate demand is weaker than less effective than the FOMC thought it would But-and this builds on what President Bullard just said-I think both of these explanations evolution of inflation.  In particular, surprisingly weak demand or In fact, we've seen the opposite.  In January 2010, the FOMC around course of 2012.  The consensus forecast is now that the PCE core inflation low level of accommodative over the past two-and-a half early 2010.  I have mentioned unemployment, but of course, other measures of economic activity like real GDP have also recovered more slowly than the Committee expected. observers have ascribed this miss to one of the FOMC expected it to be or monetary policy is be. are inconsistent with the surprisingly weak monetary policy should give rise to surprisingly low prices, that is, surprisingly low inflation. expected that desirable monetary policy would lead to a PCE core inflation rate of 1½ percent over the rate would be 1.8 percent over the course of 2012, and my own expectation is, in fact, it will be even higher.  I would say the behavior of inflation suggests the surprisingly economic activity is not due to surprisingly weak demand or surprisingly ineffective monetary policy.  So what's left?

at length before and so I won't go through it in any detail today, as having been a big shock to aggregate demand, but they have also the is how-and page 31 of been unexpectedly low, and inflation has Well, I talked about this but the decline in net worth and in credit availability we've experienced in 2007 are often emphasized quite rightly been a shock to aggregate supply because they hamper new business formation as well as ability of firms to engage in new projects.  Today what I've described Tealbook A, depicts this-economic activity has actually been unexpectedly high.  When you see this combination of low quantities and high

July 31-August 1, 2012

prices, it suggests that, on net, it is aggregate supply not aggregate demand that has proven to be weaker than the Committee expected.

FOMC expected that if 50 basis points around 5½ percent.  Instead, going to be less than 20 basis points below target-I would say actually at going to be around 8 percent.  If we stick with natural rate in late 2012 main counterargument I've heard to this line of reasoning-trying to use inflation as a guide to figuring out the mix I think the co-movement of inflation and unemployment over the years argues against this perspective.  Over the course of 2009 and 2010 when well below target.  Then over the past flat over the past few years.  Indeed, quite these recent data depict a stronger connection between economic work of It may be useful to put these qualitative observations onto a slightly more quantitative footing, using a Phillips curve framework.  In January 2010, the unemployment was 7 percent in late 2012, the inflation rate would be nearly below target.  Currently speaking, these observations are consistent with the Phillips curve slope of around minus one-third, and a natural rate of unemployment of the inflation rate is target for the year-and the unemployment rate is the Phillips curve slope of around minus one-third, this sounds like the has turned out to be above 7½ percent and not as low as 5½ percent.  The that of supply and demand shocks-is the argument that inflation expectations have just proven to be surprisingly well anchored, which I interpret as meaning the slope of the Phillips curve has been surprisingly close to zero.  But past few unemployment was high, core PCE inflation fell 18 months, as PCE core inflation normalized, unemployment fell sharply.  Now, these data are admittedly quite scanty; I essentially talked about two data points.  However, I don't think they suggest that the Phillips curve has been surprisingly the contrary, I would say activity and inflation than many of us would have expected in 2010, given, say, the Atkeson and Ohanian.

July 31-August 1, 2012

I've argued for some time in this Committee that the conditions.

The response to a demand shock is you weight the two elements of its dual mandate.  In contrast, adverse you're determining to such a shock, you face a distinct dual mandate tension.  In the next I will argue that the effectiveness of current policy measures To summarize my perspective, radical decline in net worth and tightening credit availability since 2007 had an adverse effect on both aggregate demand and aggregate supply inflation-a behavior that target than we would have expected-shows that this Committee through its actions has successfully offset much of the demand component of the shock.  What remains then is the supply component, which is serving holding us back.  How does the conclusion matter for policy?  Adverse demand shocks pushed down on both employment and inflation, and this means that at least qualitatively the Committee's response is somewhat easy to figure independent of how supply shocks push down on employment and up on inflation, and so when the appropriate response go-round I will argue the determination of appropriate policy depends on how we want to resolve that tension.  Just as importantly, depends critically on how the public believes that we will resolve that tension going forward.

Lacker's concerns about my memo.  I actually gap between our points of view as you do, President Lacker.  I came work at the San Francisco Fed in general not mean that at reducing unemployment.

that make me a little bit more cautious.  The economy is will provide a pickup in in a recession that, if anything, looks like it is market economies has going to continue to soften.  Also, real income growth, if you abstract from the decline have a lot of income to really 2013, especially at the federal level.  I question, how does the economy pick up speed in this environment? a spontaneous improvement in confidence that caused I don't see what over the near term would generate that given the issues of Europe and the fiscal cliff, which still Let me turn to the things obviously not growing very fast, and it is very hard to see what momentum over the near term.  You have Europe deepening rather than subsiding.  Economic growth among the emerging slowed.  The dollar has strengthened, which suggests that U.S. export growth, if anything, is probably in gasoline prices, has been on a very slow trajectory, and that certainly is going to restrain consumer spending.  And without greater job growth, you won't support consumer spending.  The fiscal contraction continues at the local, state, and federal levels, and we are likely to get more of that in early started to ask myself the Presumably, you would need some sort of households and businesses to become more optimistic about the future and willing to voluntarily reduce their saving rates.  But improvement in confidence, especially loom over the horizon.

And while I take some joy from Mario remarks that the ECB is now prepared to do more, I am a little confused about what that I wonder about the intersection between what Mario would like to charter and what the Germans would actually kinds of things that we would like to see the ECB do that are broad I think Europe is by Draghi's actually is going to be because do and what he is allowed to do under the ECB agree to.

I think the crisis is deepening in its economic Broadly, in terms of the There are some good developments-Mario's remarks are one, and the ECB, as the panEuropean banking really moving in the think that is an apt characterization.

We are in a particularly difficult situation. dimension, in terms of the breadth of the crisis, and appropriate backstop for euro zone to come through this crisis two things have to happen. the euro zone have to move to a much closer fiscal union.  And, second, path because The fiscal union destination is very difficult to reach for three reasons.  First, means all 27 countries of the European Union yes.  Now, think about what that really means in terms of parliamentary meetings, countries will balk at providing a credible fiscal union will require them to for the weaker countries getting the support through austerity is a really bad dynamic because it just keeps leading to bad macro interesting.  They are really doing all the things that they are supposed worse and worse.  That results in slippage in and abroad.  This is the biggest issue facing the outlook for the U.S. and vastly improved on Thursday, but I'm not holding I think it is a very difficult situation. In my view, for the First, the 17 countries of the individual countries have to demonstrate that their budgets are on a sustainable that is essentially a necessary condition for all 17 countries to agree to the fiscal union.  That is a really tall order. credible fiscal union requires treaty change.  That have to say referendums, and treaty changes.  That's pretty difficult.  Second, the politics to support that outcome are increasingly difficult.  The stronger backstop because of their lack of confidence that the weaker countries are going to actually meet their commitments.  And the weaker countries will balk because give up their sovereignty.  Third, the process embarking on fiscal outcomes.  Spain is pretty to be doing, but the macro outcomes in Spain are terms of achieving targets, it leads to more problems in the banking system, and it leads to loss of credibility, both at home over the near term.  I wish we had more control over the circumstances.  I'm hoping that the ECB will come up with something new my breath.

the intermeeting period, I have been growth this year, and I have become even more pessimistic that we will see sustained economic on some developments in the housing market MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Over pleased to see positive signs of progress in the housing market.  Nonetheless, in response to incoming data on broader economic activity, I have slightly marked down my projection for GDP progress in the labor market.  Before elaborating on my assessment of the broader outlook, I would like to comment more specifically that have attracted my attention.

moving up Zillow data reveal that within the Phoenix metropolitan area, the largest decline in sale in this bottom tier dropped almost year versus 33 percent in the top tier, while prices in the bottom tier have been going forward.  In this regard, Zillow finds a change in inventories negative equity is high.  Apparently, negative for sale by even more than it is suppressing sale.  The question is are likely going forward, and Zillow argues that it is Governor Duke has pointed out in recent meetings that housing prices are quite strongly in metropolitan areas like Miami and Phoenix, which were hardest hit by the housing bust.  As she noted, some evidence suggests that tight inventories are the likely cause. For example, inventories has occurred in the lowest priced tier of homes, and price increases in this tier have been largest.  In particular, the stock of homes for 66 percent last rising about twice as fast as in the top tier.  The cause of these movements in inventories may, however, be important in assessing price trends striking relationship both across and within metropolitan areas- that the of homes for sale is low where the prevalence of equity is working to suppress the supply of homes demand, by inducing underwater homeowners to withhold their homes for whether robust house price increases questionable.  They point out that with so many underwater homeowners, price appreciation, once it has become significant, will induce many homeowners currently trapped by negative

July 31-August 1, 2012

gains.  In underwater homes constitutes shadow inventory that is poised to come equity to dump their homes on the market-a response that will moderate further effect, this large stock of onto the market.

estimates that 31.4 percent of homeowners are even larger fraction-39 percent-believe their home is worth less than their appreciation on benefit accrues not to I just described most prevalent.  All in all, such considerations give me considerable assumption that house price appreciation going forward is likely to be are unlikely to be so large as to action. It seems to me that negative equity is also relevant when we evaluate the effect of house prices on consumer spending.  Nationally, Zillow currently underwater on their mortgages.  A Rasmussen poll of homeowners released just last week finds that an mortgage.  For this sizable share of homeowners, the impact of house price spending is apt to be small or nonexistent.  After all, the lion's share of the the homeowner but, instead, to the mortgage holder.  Moreover, the analysis suggests that house price increases may be disproportionately large in precisely those areas where negative equity is comfort with Tealbook's quite gradual, and any upside risks to the forecast from housing vitiate the need for further policy accords closely with consensus forecast, conditional on its underlying policy assumption.  In I have with that it envisions almost no meaningful progress in lowering next few years.  The 90 percent confidence interval around the modal end of 2014 are under 5 percent.  My views on inflation also coincide closely Turning to the broader economic outlook, my view of the economy that incorporated in the particular, given the enormous uncertainty depicted in the fan charts, any differences the modal forecast pale into insignificance.  From the standpoint of policy, the most important feature of this forecast is unemployment over the unemployment forecast is quite wide.  Even so, it appears that the odds of a return to full employment by the

July 31-August 1, 2012

growth, fan charts portray the risks to the consensus forecast as symmetric.  In with Governor Tarullo.  I view them as weighted to the downside because of to Europe and fiscal policy.  I hope we can devise some way going from a economic outcomes than those costs, given how far we already are from full with those incorporated in the consensus forecast.  In particular, I expect that well-anchored inflation expectations, continuing downward pressure from high unemployment on wage and moderate increases in import prices will keep inflation running below the Committee's 2 percent objective.  The contrast, I agree continuing risks relating forward to incorporate such asymmetry of risks into the consensus forecast, because policy standpoint, it is not just the modal outlook but also the distribution of risks around that path that should inform our judgments.  In particular, weaker associated with the baseline entail unusually large employment.  Moreover, should such risks materialize, our scope for response will be limited.

alternative paths table 2 and exhibit 3 of the consensus forecast are an invitation to do so.  As the forecast that several of you cited.  It is known as criterion, and it states that both the inflation and output gaps should normally not be called for to bring both inflation and output closer to their targets. where we failed to take further action, I think any identifiable costs of deploying our remaining tools 2 also illustrates one of the key lessons I took I don't want to jump too far into the policy debate today, but the depicted in Chairman noted, the suboptimality of the baseline consensus forecast is striking.  Our violates a key principle of optimal monetary policy Qvigstad's simultaneously positive or negative.  If both gaps are negative, as in the consensus forecast, a more accommodative policy is Were we to make this forecast public at a meeting it would be a challenge to articulate how could conceivably outweigh the benefits.  Exhibit away from the rules memo.  It appears that the policy path incorporated into the baseline consensus forecast lies close to the prescription of the outcome-based rule.  As the rules memo

July 31-August 1, 2012

emphasized, the performance of this rule is quite suboptimal under the current circumstances.

The consensus forecast drives that point home.

with at least the first four of Governor Tarullo's propositions modal outlook, conditional on policy consistent with our June growth and excruciatingly slow progress in lowering around that outlook is due to downside risks.  So in go-round, I will argue that unless the outlook over the next six weeks action at the September meeting. In conclusion, I agree without reservation.  My statement, involves moderate unemployment toward normal levels.  I envision inflation running below 2 percent. Unfortunately, the bulk of the uncertainty tomorrow's policy improves substantially, we should prepare to take strong

going to take just a minute or two to also with Governor Tarullo about his propositions and his questions.  But I spend long enough he won't ask any questions next time.  [Laughter] MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am engage in dialogue knowing how difficult it is for Governor Tarullo to sit still during all of these discussions, I bet that if

I would agree that the economy is cruddy, and I would emphasize the importance of low confidence and high also agree with the Vice Chairman that improvements in the financial have made the recovery a and more sturdy and resilient to shocks. First of all, I would say on the five propositions that generally pretty uncertainty.  I would condition of the financial institutions, of businesses, and of consumers little less fragile

I believe that a significant recovery in housing is necessary for our economy to recover.  I As to the questions, on the first one, I don't think anybody would be surprised to know that

July 31-August 1, 2012

I am certainly pleased that Governor Yellen now at least am not certain that it is sufficient, and sees some signs on the horizon of a recovery in housing.

I think there is a question of the magnitude, for me, the other question is the timing of you go back and look at forecasts over the years, and you read the narrative, a lot of the forecast misses have to do with the efficacy of any policy we employed.  Even in the current Tealbook, the narrative year or 18 months, and then the sun comes whether that is going to happen. On the second, what is the magnitude of drag from potential fiscal and euro shocks? While when these headwinds finally dissipate.  I think that if last couple of assumptions about when these headwinds would be reduced, much more so than they do about policy or assumes that the Europeans figure it out in another out.  I don't know sure that is the case, but I do believe that access to credit has been the regulatory response to the crisis, particularly with credit cards, As to the third question, whether household spending and saving patterns have changed fundamentally, I am not changed fundamentally by home equity, and mortgages.  I don't think that is something that is going to change.  And I don't, frankly, have an opinion on structural damage, so that's the end of that piece.

wouldn't necessarily take exception to the baseline I would lean closer to the lower values in the second half of this year that are in the reasons vary from stresses in Europe to China slowing to the fiscal collapse. election, which to me seems to make sense.  Certainly, our really need to do is As to the consensus forecast, I forecast, but baseline forecast of the Tealbook.  The reports from the banks are that there is a lot of caution out there, and the But, regardless, there seems to be a growing reluctance on the part of businesses to make any long-term decisions until after the own forecasts are heavily dependent on assumptions about fiscal actions.  And although David Wilcox talks about the tyranny of having to write something down, all we

July 31-August 1, 2012

categories, specific programs, et cetera.  So I everyone hitting the pause button until after the end year.  More broadly, when I think about the evolution of forecasts over the last several as I just said-the timing of when underlying economic growth starts to show good as any. assume a dollar value.  For most businesses, the relevant assumptions are some very specific choices about tax rates, tax deductions, spending am beginning to believe that the effect of election will slow the economy even more than the fundamentals might suggest through the of this Tealbooks-and through to better results seems to depend importantly on judgments about the resolution of problems in Europe.  And I'm at a loss as to when and how they will resolve, so I think the Tealbook assumptions are as yet, but it seems to me likely to be conversations with bankers, those who were in markets or had business real estate activity were the most upbeat.  And were more cautious.  Loan growth Banks all banks, asset yields are steadily coming down as maturing assets are funding, is down to 58 basis On a more positive note, signals of improvement in the real estate market are more widespread.  I wouldn't call the improvement strong sustainable.  In my models that were more heavily influenced by those who were focused more on manufacturing or agriculture and demand is still centered in C&amp;I lending to large companies and auto lending to consumers. Still, several bankers cautioned that even this demand seems to be flattening recently. with mortgage origination businesses reported record volumes and earnings with refinance volumes dominating.  For these banks, mortgage revenues are helping to offset the steady decline in interest margins.  For replaced at lower rates, and deposit costs are down to remarkably low levels as CD portfolios shrink and funds move to money market or transaction accounts.  Indeed, the total cost of funding for the industry, which includes deposits and wholesale points.  One very large bank reported deposit costs of 19 basis points.

Right expense category is people, so this means reducing head counts.  Larger banks footprints are looking at ways to move jobs from high labor cost markets into lowerbusiness lines. While the level to which banks have been able to push down their deposit costs is encouraging, it also raises some caution flags.  First, there is not much room to lower deposit costs much further.  And, second, while banks still consider most of these to be stable core deposits, the bunching up into overnight accounts indicates that they may be poised for flightinto CDs, into investments, a change of banks, under the mattress.  It's really hard to tell. now, banks are also looking to expense reduction to offset these lower margins.  After interest, the largest bank with bigger cost locations.  In addition, many banks are trimming branch networks and reevaluating their products and their don't see much change in the outlook since our last meeting, in the second half of this year as businesses All of this is to say that I except for a more pronounced damping of activity wait for clarity.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I've been concerned for several months that the pace of In my Because my views about the most-likely outcome activity haven't changed much, in my remarks today I'd like to mention some could continue to hold back growth. MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My outlook for the economy hasn't changed much since the last time we met. consumer spending wasn't sustainable.  So the bad news we received on that front-that PCE growth slowed considerably in the second quarter-wasn't particularly surprising to me. view, the economy will continue to be characterized by unacceptably high unemployment and below 2 percent inflation for quite some time. for economic slow-moving forces that

July 31-August 1, 2012

as looked at from the perspective of real GDP is weak.  Of course, real But an alternative indicator of the state of demand is private domestic final sales.  This government spending, net exports, and inventories, not because they aren't can be pretty noisy and misleading.  Unlike growth of private domestic final sales two years.  To me, same time, weak demand for their products will likely make them even reluctant to hire and expand capacity than they already seem to be.  Typically it is just get slowing incomes and even weaker demand.  The slow pace of growth in demand economy we don't seem to have the same kinds of imbalances and a deep downturn.  However, with the unemployment rate 8 percent, any nontrivial weakening of the economy would obviously be devastating. we're vulnerable to stalling out right now, it seems pretty unlikely we could any negative shocks, such as a fiscal cliff or more weakness from Europe. First, the economy GDP growth bounces around from quarter to quarter, so I wouldn't want to take too much signal from it. measure strips out important components of spending, but because they the relative bounciness of real GDP quarter to quarter, the shows quite a bit of persistence from quarter to quarter.  Significantly, this measure slowed appreciably in the second quarter, falling to its lowest growth rate in nearly this doesn't bode well for the state of the recovery.  With demand rising this slowly, businesses might start to find themselves with an unwanted accumulation of inventories and need to pare back production.  At the more these kinds of dynamics that bring on recessions, and once this negative cycle gets under way, of course, we in the second quarter seems dangerously close to the growth rates we often see as the stalls out just before it turns down.  I consider this outcome to be a quite salient risk to my baseline projection.  If the economy did tip into a recession, it probably wouldn't turn into a particularly deep recession because overbuilding that we often do before still above Moreover, if weather

But acceleration is doomed to be very gradual and subpar because I think there are as more persistent than temporary headwinds, more as elements that require groups of policymakers to mitigate.  One example of a slowof reform in Europe, which of course, we've been discussing for years. local government finances.  In addition to the and finding themselves in the midst of some stresses that have been years.  These stresses include soaring pension, Medicaid, and retiree health-care of big, local government entities have declared bankruptcy. Of course, in the baseline forecasts of most of this Committee we're expecting some controlled acceleration over the next couple momentum would be, but it seems likely that once the uncertainties hanging over our heads right now dissipate, there will positive momentum, which is just the reverse of the story in my view, the slow-moving forces in our economy that will continue to keep momentum from developing.  I think of these forces significant attention by particular moving force is the pace Another is the existence of deteriorating state and cuts in spending and jobs that have resulted from cyclically low tax revenues, many cities counties increasingly are brewing for costs.

July 31-August 1, 2012

[Laughter] MR. POWELL.  Tell me about it!

Let me just say that I'm quite close to the consensus forecast that you put a tenth more optimistic on GDP growth for 2013-2014.  But either way, I MR. STEIN. forward, albeit maybe think Governor Duke put it just right-it's pretty cruddy.

few words about the state of play in credit markets and what we a specific question, about how credit risk is being priced right now?  Clearly, one of the things with LSAPs, the MEP, and accommodative policy more generally is to put therefore you want to So where do we stand?  A simple first cut is to look at credit spreads.  Now, you look at credit spreads, I would say they seem relatively unremarkable, and if anything, I pulled some data from the St. For example, if you look at the spread on the AA-rated to Treasuries, the the spread is 114 basis points versus a pre-crisis norm of 63 basis points, where I'm using 2002 to 2006.  Similarly, if you look at sort of deep junk, the B-rated you would as sort of on the high side.  These data certainly wouldn't make you think there's a you wish you could push a little Let me instead say a might be able to infer about the effects of our policies to date.  To frame what do we know we're trying to do downward pressure on credit risk premiums.  At the same time there is implicit in this some kind of Goldilocks notion that presumably we don't want to go too far, and know where we are. if somewhat above the typical values that we saw before the crisis. Louis Fed's website. data show that by 'pre-crisis' spread is currently 617 basis points versus a pre-crisis norm of 456-again characterize it lot of reaching for risk, and it would instead, if anything, make bit harder to narrow those spreads.

wanted to make here is that I think you need to be a little bit cobble together three distinct factors.  First, But the main point that I careful in interpreting credit spreads because they there's just actuarial expected default risk, that is to say independent of investor appetite or

July 31-August 1, 2012

risk; if the world gets more uncertain as everybody has talked about, that's returns for investors.  Second is really relevant in the current environment, is what you might call the safe-haven Treasuries.  That is to say that if there is powerful safe-haven demand are going to appreciate; there will be downward pressure yields.  That will give the appearance of heightened credit spreads, but not due to In other words, the safe-haven and the reaching-forharder to read, at least willingness to bear going to tend to widen spreads, but it doesn't mean higher the credit risk premium.  That's the item of interest that we'd like to understand and that corresponds in some sense to investors' net expected return, net of defaults or downgrades. Third, and potentially or 'moneyness' effect in and a scarcity of Treasuries, Treasuries on Treasury credit, but due to demand for safe assets. risk effects may be pulling in opposite directions, making credit spreads naively.

disentangling these three things?  One thing that I fooled around AA-rated spread is in a relative sense more likely to be informative about the more likely dominated by credit risk. curious fact.  Although both of these spreads are high in absolute terms, given their AA-rated spreads are now, B-rated low.  I did a regression-my most advanced piece of empirical work If you take the regression, and then you take the historical relationship know about AA-rated spreads, it predicts that the B-rated spread should words, it is 300 basis points surprisingly to the low side. How do you think about with is to look at the historical relationship between, say, B-rated spreads and AA-rated spreads and to ask to what extent current spreads are deviating from that relationship.  The idea I had in mind is that the safe-haven stuff because credit risk is minimal.  So variation due to the credit risk piece should be smaller, whereas of course the B-rated spread should be But here's a relative historical relationship to one another and given where spreads look anomalously in my life.  [Laughter] and you plug in what we be 900 and some basis points.  In other

July 31-August 1, 2012

that the AA-rated spread is curiously high.  That it is 40 basis points higher than you would expect given your knowledge of the B-rated You can just turn that statement around and say is to say spread.

are two logical possibilities.  Either there's an abnormal safe-haven premium in the both.  To parse further, one thing you could do is to look at data on relatively attractive terms on the so, but on the high side.  For example, for the been about 32 percent.  So it's about 1 standard also in the 40s.  I don't want to overstate this-the series has been and in the last few weeks it has fallen off a little bit-but basically there's been There AA-rated spread or there's an abnormally compressed credit risk premium in the B-rated spread or, quite likely, some of issuance volume.  Consistent with what I'm claiming are the low-grade bonds, the fraction of nonfinancial public bond issues that have been junk bond issues has been on the high side lately, not extraordinarily three months ending in May 2012, the high-yield share of bond issues, the share that were junk, was 43 percent, whereas the norm since 1983 has deviation on the high side.  Just as a benchmark, the average value during the credit boom period, 2004-2006, was choppy, relatively healthy issuance of junk bonds.

couple of my colleagues, Robin you want a forward-looking measure of credit risk, that you want a model that forecasts how you will do as an investor in low-grade credit, at the share of bond issues that are junk bonds.  The is a lot of demand and a lot of appetite for credit, you'll see a you share, you get estimates-and of course, these are Now, a very interesting fact-and this is due to a Greenwood and Sam Hanson-is that if is to say, if the best forecasting variable is not credit spreads, but it's this issuance measure.  You can forecast how junk bonds will do by looking firms are market timers; when there lot of issuance of lower-grade credit.  Moreover, the magnitude of this effect is such that if plug in the current values of the high-yield

July 31-August 1, 2012

standard errors-that for a junk bond investor, the expected return over Treasuries is on the order of minus 1 percent a year.  This forward-looking caveats. noisy, big over the next three years measure-and it's consistent with my other little exercise-is low, though of course, again, there are many

In terms of the overall financial market conditions facing firms, I view this as a good thing at this point.  It's an indication that at least the first leg of our closer in some sense to the Goldilocks point than we might think.  Of course, it is be answered with these I will say that going forward, one wants to monitor this.  If you think you're almost at the it from a financial stability perspective.  This is an appeal as go forward, and especially if we find ourselves doing another LSAP, to be attentive to these going to going to be pulling down on a chance we'll not really get much information from What does this all mean? and especially lower-credit-quality firms, it suggests that things are somewhat more accommodative than you might get out of just the simplest credit spread measures.  Now, to be clear, policy proposition is working.

I note that neither the Tealbook nor the Moving on to my having been a little bit weaker on balance than expectations, with a handful of positives, mainly housing and autos, and a household spending, and significantly weakness in the industrial sector.  I see the employment sector, the June employment report and the six unemployment claims reports, as being slightly lower but broadly consistent with the lower end of expectations.  In fact, if whole range of data since the last meeting, range of for the rest of with the proposed consensus forecast.

I continue to see U.S. inflation, at 1.8 percent, as low and under running just below 2 percent, but with moderate economic growth, that is not around the table have said and the Tealbook suggested-that the weak numbers are not weakening in June and July.  Forecasts for have come down for some.  Forward-looking indicators for the sector is very little light vehicle in my sample, so that's a positive that's missing.  Also the companies that I talked are feeling real strength there.  When industrial companies see themselves cost actions to protect profitability, and that means hiring freezes and second-quarter end to that effect, and going forward prove accurate.  So far, in the claims data, but at a minimum, this sector seems unlikely to be a the time being.  Uncertainty comes up in every conversation, and it with defense exposure.  That could change as the year goes on. While the broader economy is moving along the case in the industrial sector.  My contacts in the industrial sector anecdotally confirm what many just due to special factors, but rather to a fundamental weakening in conditions.  Since our previous meeting a substantial number of industrial companies, about 10 of which I have spoken to, have experienced or publicly reported further growth and profitability point to continued weakness.  I should point out that there manufacturing to that are in housing missing plan, they take layoffs.  You see a number of announcements around the that trend will certainly strengthen if the poor indicators there's no sign of it source of job growth for revolves around the direction of the economy and Europe.

Private domestic final sales, which tend to one participant noted that the slowdown is reminiscent of what happened this time last year that factors such uncertainty could lead to stronger this regard.  Others noted that they had not marked down their medium-term forecast by much. There fiscal issues, weakness spreading in the global economy, including China as well as Europe, the U.S. economy looks relatively and seasonal issues, the June labor market report was growth in wage income is restraining household spending.  Progress in looks likely to be quite slow given modest economic growth.  Housing In the household sector, the data suggest that consumer spending has slowed.

If so, labor market slack is very soft, and that it is not important, A key question is whether there has been structural damage that is reducing the economy's potential regained.  The alternative view is that we are seeing the effects of pervasively weak aggregate demand punctuated by short periods of faster economic question of how much slack there is.  One issue is whether duration dependence probability of finding a job is due to unobserved heterogeneity may be less than it appears.  The behavior of wages and prices was argued as evidence both that slack is important, because wage and price inflation because inflation has not fallen by more.

you MR. PLOSSER.  Not an aggregate statement.  You may want to qualify that, the way put it.

as a CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Well, this conversation, I think, will be viewed qualification.

I want to come back to the debate from about slack and inflation, and I'll try to make the prepared part of my remarks I would take note that the NIPA revisions were obviously less of a shock than year, but they did in fact move economic growth in both 2010 and 2011 closer to 2 percent, 2 percent growth through this entire recovery. growth is just simply not enough to give us significant I think, in somewhat fragile condition.  Now, a question is, why is the the and financial crises.  The part of the paper that I used to look at this was their series of spider charts that compares typical cyclical patterns in a wide variety of average of banking and Let me talk a little bit about my own views. yesterday relatively quick. last and so we have a very consistent pattern of about Of course, the problem is that 2 percent improvement in the labor market or to provide protection against adverse shocks, and the recovery continues to be, recovery so weak?  To get a little bit of insight on this question, I made some use of work by staff-Greg Howard, Robert Martin, and Beth Anne Wilson, who have a paper that analyzes recoveries from banking issue variables both against previous postwar U.S. cycles and against the financial crisis recessions from other countries.

July 31-August 1, 2012

comparisons, while a few things were obvious, I thought a couple of the were interesting.  Unsurprisingly, relative particularly to other U.S. postwar course, growth, but it's still less than normal in a recovery, and for slow growth.  I thought more interesting was the fact that with other financial crisis cycles. purchases are increasing more strongly than might be expected, which and are willing to buy consumer course, stock as well.  Likewise, broader consumption spending also seems to be given the slow pace of the recovery.  Now, that's a bit of a tricky statement of the economy that, obviously, it can't I still find that interesting.  The one exception is consumption of with further investigation, it turns out that a lot of also looks relatively normal. Looking at those comparisons recessions, housing and mortgage credit have been important drags.  Housing is now, of a positive contributor to economic therefore is still one of the reasons spending on consumer durables and nonresidential investment both seem to be behaving more or less normally compared both with previous business cycles and Indeed, arguably, durables I take to be at least a little bit inconsistent with the view that pervasive uncertainty is the dominant factor.  If people are willing to make investments durables, that at least suggests some willingness to make commitments.  Of adjustment may be a factor relatively normal, because, of course, consumption is such a big part diverge by too much, but services, which is slower than normal.  But that difference is because of slow growth in housing services and financial services, which is certainly understandable.  So consumer behavior finding that came out of these comparisons was the role of What really sticks out in the spider charts is how weak government and government transfers are in this recovery compared with all of the references.  To declines at an annual rate of about 2.3 percent for the past two years.  And I thought the most interesting fiscal policy in this recovery. spending give some numbers, government consumption and investment-both federal and state and local-have averaged

got less clear results from looking at their work, and I should say any of what I'm saying here.  Exports are growing close Here I would refer you to the interesting presentation at the last FOMC meeting where the effects of the European crisis on growth and came up with you put together the European crisis, restraint, and maybe a little something for housing, you can easily account for something 1½ percentage points, maybe a little more, of economic growth.  And the difference between substantial and helps explain at least part of the reason why this On the external sector, I that they're not in any way implicated in to normal, but foreign advanced economies are clearly weaker than they are in a normal recovery. the staff tried to estimate something on the order of 1 percentage point.  All told, if fiscal like 2 and 3½ clearly is very recovery is so unsatisfactory.

slack that has been so central to many of I do believe that insufficient aggregate demand is an important reason-not the growing so slowly.  And I think go around the table and ask people for their explanations of why factors.  For example, confidence are basically aggregate demand determinants, not aggregate I mentioned, are important; that's an aggregate demand Europe appears to be affecting us not only through exports, but also through risk Let me jump from that now to the question of our discussions in the last few meetings.  Just to give my own bias, which I'm sure everybody is familiar with, only reason, but an important reason-for why the economy is it's interesting that when we economic growth is slow, most of the factors cited are aggregate demand uncertainty and lack of supply determinants.  Fiscal factors, as factor.

July 31-August 1, 2012

would interpret that as primarily would interpret the weakness in housing coming from credit output not entirely, but primarily, through So it seems that when we try to identify the specific factors, aggregate you think about what growth model tells us that basically there are two factors that determine I haven't heard anybody say that growth in the labor Now, it's true that there have been declining participation rates, but that has been factors are certainly part of the story. aversion, stock prices, investment decisions, and the like; I aggregate demand.  And I constraints and the end of the bubble as affecting aggregate demand. demand is a big part of the story.  I think it's important to recognize, if determines aggregate supply, that the best analysis we have of that is the Solow growth model. And the Solow aggregate supply.  One is technological change-and technological change has been permanently altered-and the other is the force. incorporated into the Tealbook analysis and doesn't really change the basic result that output is below potential.  Again, I think if we look at the factors that people are citing as important, aggregate demand crises are often followed by permanent loss of output-that is, you fully recovers the loss of Howard et al. paper that I referenced earlier has a conclusion something But I think what makes me skeptical that a permanent loss of output is the whole story looking at what we call the unemployment gap-the difference between the current what we think is the sustainable rate of unemployment-instead of this is completely an aggregate supply story, the sustainable rate of unemployment suddenly jumped from 5 percent about labor markets that can explain At this point, I should acknowledge that there are certainly results in the literature suggesting that financial could think of it as a parallel shift down in the growth path that never output.  And indeed, the like that. comes from unemployment rate and looking at potential output.  In order to argue that you have to explain why to 8 percent.  And I don't think there's any plausible story

July 31-August 1, 2012

have been many studies on this issue, and many factors have been weakness of the job market for new graduates, patterns of skill I think it's fair to say that a very substantial part of the increase in unemployment is cyclical in nature.  I don't claim any more strong evidence that it's purely structural; I obvious cause. that.  In particular, there examined, including the mismatches, geographic mobility, and so on.  And part, if not the majority, of the studies that have looked at this would conclude that a considerable from that than to say that we certainly don't have think there's still a lot of uncertainty about that.  But again, it would be very unusual for the sustainable unemployment rate to jump by 3 percentage points without any was an interesting discussion yesterday about the inflation data and what they have for the measurement of slack.  And here I think that inflation is a useful would note some From 1934 to 1939, inflation averaged 1.5 percent.  From 1940 to 1941, the 12 percentage points as the war geared up.  Japan has had persistent a little bit below zero; it seems impervious to gaps.  So it does seem to inflation has many determinants.  We've talked a lot about the effects of well-anchored in the last few years we've also seen some very big swings in and account for at least some of the movement in I think inflation is a useful thing to look at, but because many factors affect inflation because there are many puzzles and gaps in our understanding of inflation, I don't think it's, Now, there implications datum in this discussion, but it's hardly dispositive about the degree of slack.  I historical examples. unemployment rate fell by inflation close to zero or be the case that inflation can be difficult to explain, particularly close to zero.  Moreover, in general, inflation expectations, but commodity prices, which in turn are influenced by global conditions.  And those commodity prices have, to some extent, gotten into core inflation. and again, dispositive.

few years against inflation and were citing work like Atkeson and Ohanian, which says to go the other way; people are claiming that there must be a very strong relationshipwould get an inflation problem.  I think we've got to agree on what we Phillips curve. I would also note that there's been a little bit of a flip in the argument here.  A ago, some folks around the table were arguing that the amount of slack in the economy was not going to protect us that there's very little relationship between the output gap and inflation.  And now the argument seems which would imply that inflation should be falling now-or, alternatively, that if we were to be more expansionary, we think the coefficient is in the

I want to recognize that there's a great deal of uncertainty here, a great guess my last comment would be that I hope, as we think about policy you will-approach to our policy thinking.  In particular, while we should be taking be considering the costs not only of also of non-action, the costs of being right and the benefits of being right, and the would you do believe that 8 percent unemployment is far from the sustainable level, and that the marginal cost as you make that calculation.  I'll stop there.  Any questions or To summarize, deal of uncertainty.  And I in the next round, that we take an appropriately humble but also probabilistically basedBayesian, if into account the uncertainty that we have, we should also action but costs of being wrong.  And of course, that's a parallel calculation.  The one observation I make is that if that inflation is close to target, the usual objective function would suggest of more unemployment is much higher than the marginal cost of more inflation, and that should enter into your thinking comments?  President Bullard.

the economy and prices are flexible, unemployment is going to go up MR. BULLARD.  Mr. Chairman, modern monetary theory is based on sticky prices. And I think one of the things that we've talked about around the table, maybe at cross-purposes, is that if a big shock hits

July 31-August 1, 2012

you're going to get a little bit reaction on those variables than you would otherwise get, and according to the theories and output is going to go down.  But because prices are sticky, different I know, it's that gap that's supposed to be the important one for monetary policy.  We don't seem to want to do that.  I don't understand why we don't want to do that.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Do what?

Look at that gap, analyze that gap, use modern macro theory to make MR. BULLARD. our policy decisions.

look at to make that decision? you think the economy would be under where you think the economy is under sticky prices.  If there was no gap of CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  What would we MR. BULLARD.  It's the gap between where flexible prices and that sort, according to the theories we like to cite, there would be no rationale for what we're doing.

I'd welcome an analysis that tried to put that together. different in this case from those cases. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I think the historical evidence is that there's a pretty smooth component in unemployment.  It does, obviously, vary over short periods, but in the medium term it tends to come back to a relatively smooth trend.  And it's not clear what's that come out I'm talking about, and sometimes distant from what that theory is creates confusion around the table. MR. BULLARD.  I think we flip between sometimes using the arguments of Woodford and his coauthors, which are based on what going to just straight empirical evidence that might be kind of talking about.  And that

reasons why CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think it boils down to asking the question of whether, given that the recession started almost five years ago, there are identifiable mismatch or other such issues are persisting.  Again, my sense of the research that's been done is

July 31-August 1, 2012

reasonable approximation of President Evans. that most of it-not all of it, but most of it-finds that that gap, or a that gap, is still pretty big.

I listen to this discussion, I don't think there's a you on this.  Mr. Chairman, you cited Solow you had the opinion, which I agree with, that technology explanations for in potential output are unlikely to be very large.  Labor issues could be a part of that. about in terms of output in the flexible-price going to be related to precisely those same issues when the economy is well are going to be impediments to I agree with you that it seems to be flat as it is? analysis we look at, heavily explanations.  But I don't really between the two of your explanations.  All of those things are MR. EVANS.  Could I just say that, as tremendous disagreement between the two of growth, where reductions But the construct that President Bullard is talking economy is roughly functioning.  And then in the sticky price economy, there achieving that.  That's what the gap is about.  Empirically, very slow in adjusting.  The real question is, why is the slope of the Phillips curve as Or why is inflation determination in these models, or any economic dependent on intercept terms like inflation expectations?  Those are the kinds of puzzles that you're talking about, which I think have challenged everybody's see a lot of disagreement fundamental in our own DSGE analysis in the Chicago Fed model, and they're explained in the context of that theory.

I'd offer that we inspect a variety of tools, both based.  One of the pieces of evidence that we look to is evidence on Figura and Regis of 1 percentage point or a little more. a state-based model due to Charles Fleischman and CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Did you have something, David, on this point? MR. WILCOX.  Yes.  I just thought statistical and more theory shifts in the matching function, which is based on research by Andrew Barnichon.  That shows an increase in the NAIRU Another statistical framework that we use is

July 31-August 1, 2012

have built into the lot of resources in, a DSGE could just say a word about what that and it's among the stable of pieces of evidence that we look to. John Roberts, and that yields estimates that are broadly similar to what we staff forecast.  We do have, and carefully maintain and invest a model.  And so I thought, to be response, Michael Kiley DSGE model shows because it is based in the sort of optimizing framework that President Bullard is referring to

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Michael?

general equilibrium model with sticky financial frictions.  That model has a particular model Galí, Smets, and Wouters, where it that in a framework like that, it's exactly true that when there are only and not too much capital, the social welfare In a more factors may be involved.  For example, our DSGE model takes there are different sectors of production, that the prices in different In all of those by gap.  For example, research at the Cleveland Fed shows that you want to take MR. KILEY.  We maintain a dynamic stochastic prices and sticky wages and a number of of the labor market that does include unemployment, and so there is a natural rate of unemployment that corresponds to the flexible price natural rate.  When we look at that, it's really quite smooth, consistent with other research like that of looks like the natural rate of unemployment is quite smooth, and you can attribute most of the fluctuations in the unemployment rate within a DSGE framework to fluctuations in 'aggregate demand,' although within the DSGE framework, people don't use that kind of language very often.  I would also note sticky prices and wages and not much dynamics function basically has in it the output gap that President Bullard described. complicated world, though, other into account the fact that sectors might be different, that there might be different wages and different wage adjustment processes in those different sectors, and that there may be financial frictions. distortions, the world is just not the same as one in which welfare is maximized simply closing the output

and those enter the perfectly consistent with the view that a modern theory is consistent like you do around the table, you want to take into account many factors in into account impediments in the credit system-that those lower welfare social welfare function.  So I do think that the analysis we have-and it's only one model; other models would provide different answers-is macro model would have a reasonable unemployment gap in it.  And that with the view that, thinking about how to achieve social welfare.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Questions for Bill?  President Rosengren.

good memos I'd be curious to know your view of the effect of reversing the and to hear you quantify a little bit more what the more refinancing and other opportunities for dealing with the flow of you view the costs of that to be? MR. ROSENGREN.  I have a question on alternative A.  We had some very on market functioning, but numbers between Treasuries and mortgages market functioning argument would be, particularly if we're successful in bringing rates down and presumably there's mortgages.  Could you talk a little bit about how those numbers were chosen and, if we reversed the numbers, what

July 31-August 1, 2012

greater capacity on the Treasury side than on the MBS side.  It seemed natural to have component than MBS component.  But I you were buying $1 trillion and wanted to shift that more in the direction of MBS, it MR. ENGLISH.  I think the numbers were chosen to roughly match the total purchasable amounts that we found in the memo that showed the capacity for purchases, which showed that there was a purchase program that included a larger Treasury think if would be feasible.

you go to the Desk briefing from yesterday-quite high as a percentage of the MR. POTTER.  The issue would just be the reinvestments as well.  At 45 plus 25 to 30, that's getting-if gross issuance.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.

also want to alter this proportion over time. pretty high at first as rates are pushed down, and then the MBS flow fair to say that the optimal division might not be fixed VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  You might The MBS flow might be might be somewhat less later on.  So is it over time, that you might want to shift it?

you would starting with, but over time, as issues arose with regard to market functioning or there were MR. ENGLISH.  I think that's right.  The idea was that these are the numbers be changes in the flow of new MBS or whatever, there would be the opportunity to make those adjustments.

I like the idea of having a little more flexibility Treasuries.  If the constraint is the ultimate capacity-let's say if you're $1 trillion-would there be any reason not to start with more heavily weighting the Alternative A has fixed proportions over time, but would it be MR. ROSENGREN.  Just to follow up, between mortgages and doing mortgages at the outset and then, if there were issues that were cropping up, to reduce the amount of mortgages over time?

July 31-August 1, 2012

focuses more on mortgages at the outset and beneficial to have a more flexible program that then, as problems crop up, if they do crop up, to alter that allocation?

Certainly that would be feasible.  I think it's up to the Committee, in I don't think there's a technical reason to not do that. MR. ENGLISH. some sense.  I know there are some on the Committee who have strong feelings about buying MBS versus buying Treasuries, but

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.

gives you the for buck.  On the one hand, you could argue that buying Treasuries gives you a bigger for buck because of the longer-duration asset.  On the other hand, you could argue that you more bang for buck because you're working on two margins-not just of long-term rates, but also the spread between mortgages and Treasuries-and it's bang for buck for Treasuries versus agency MBS?  And then, two, what the capacity constraints, and how quickly do you run into the market functioning issues?  My going to save this until my comments later, but I think it's probably issues gives you the most bang for buck and what are the cost-benefit tradeoffs as you push the potential risks to market functioning.  I look at the alternative A until we do some additional work that will allow us to there should VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think there's an issue of what actually most bang bang agency MBS gives the level more directly related to the housing market.  I think there are two separate issues here.  One, what's the magnitude of are personal opinion-I was germane to say it now-is that I would like the staff to do a little bit more work on these of what further down in terms of numbers as a little bit of a placeholder have a deeper discussion about what that split should be and how much flexibility be as it evolves over time.

I can add just one further complexity, it matters which Treasuries MR. ENGLISH.  If you're buying as well.

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes, sure.

Yes. MR. ENGLISH.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.

I follow up on that point?  I just wanted Simon to clarify because, if recall correctly, when we went through your exhibit 19 yesterday, the Chairman asked for MR. FISHER.  May I clarification of the numbers.  We would, at the end of this program, own 54 percent of the outstanding Treasuries between 3 and 30-is that correct?

MEP. MR. POTTER.  That's our estimate including the

MR. FISHER.  Yes.

That's the way we did the calculation, yes. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So that's the MEP plus the two-year program? MR. POTTER.  Yes.

MR. FISHER.  But to go to Bill's point, between concentration?  And what would that concentration be?

6 and 30, would there be a higher

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Duke.

I think it is important to maintain some flexibility about how this is because the gross issuance number may actually There are some indications right now that the originators are at capacity, and have been announcements that would indicate that some of those originators are further At the same time, FHFA announced yesterday that Freddie is going to move refinancing.  And then the third piece is, as the rates come down, you have and get crowded out.  So I think it makes sense to really pay and move slowly. MS.

on the same theme of being attentive to market spreads. want to worry about capacity, but to me, a situation in which the Desk's basis is eroding would be much less troubling than, for example, one in Treasuries seem to just detach from the rest of the curve.  We might have plenty of getting much passMR. STEIN.  Yes, more Obviously, we execution on an intraday which liquidity in the market, but if we fool with just pulling Treasuries and not through to spreads-this is essentially consistent with what President Rosengren was saying-

July 31-August 1, 2012

we would want to start moving on the other spreads instead.  It's a little harder to conceptualize and to measure, maybe, than the really narrow market functioning stuff, but I think it's ultimately more important from a macro kind of perspective.

Vice Chairman Dudley's point as well. MR. POTTER.  That was

MR. STEIN.  Yes.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Powell.

to what Vice Chairman Dudley was mentioning, I'd like to for buck from buying MBS we think is in the housing rates and how much of it is just from removing duration, as though we I don't know if you have that now, but if not, then during the MR.

MR. POWELL.  Thank you.

Yes. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. MR. ENGLISH.

Of course, there are house price effects and other channels.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any other questions for Bill?  Governor Raskin.

whether the outcomes for the alternative A at are we to assume that there is no difference? MS. RASKIN.  I just want to make sure LSAP that were shown on page 1 are 3, or are we looking 3′? And given that there is just one path here,

July 31-August 1, 2012

Because these were calculations done for the consensus forecast, they exactly alternative A, but basically a $1 trillion purchase program.  You could think of it you bring it to a close has fallen by, I think, about 0.4 percentage enough of a move in the unemployment rate that it's your purchases to a close. MR. ENGLISH. aren't as either 3′ , just the stock version, or the flow version, but it happens that in the fall of 2013 because the unemployment rate point by then, and you declare that to be time to bring that when we do our policy go-round, we will probably 3 and any, but I'm MS. RASKIN.  Okay.  I imagine want to elaborate on differences between 3′ . This suggests that there aren't not sure analytically if that's correct.

flow version?  If the hurdle for bringing that program to a close is more and what threshold you roughly in line with paragraph 3.  The other thing to keep in mind is, expected to be at the outset, there is the thought that the flow greater reassurance that the Committee is going to keep buying until good happens.  If there's a negative shock, then the amount of purchases could be in order to potentially provide greater confidence effects, aside from that people anticipate. MR. ENGLISH.  I think the question is, when would you choose to end the flow of purchases under the substantial, so it would be in place for longer, then it would be a bigger purchase program you'd get a bigger kick on the economy.  I think we didn't know exactly would want to apply, and so we tried to write down a $1 trillion purchase program as something that plausibly might be beyond what the purchases are version may provide something increased in a flexible way the amount of purchases

MR. ENGLISH.  Absolutely-quite right.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard, question?

July 31-August 1, 2012

guess there could be confidence I be that these are question; I have another question, but go MR. BULLARD.  Yes.  On page 1 of the handout, I bands around the unemployment rate and PCE inflation.  How confident can statistically different, these two lines?  That's one ahead.

confidence bands, we know the confidence bands around these calculated correct confidence bands But presumably these are not big effects relative to the around our estimates. MR. ENGLISH.  On the things are very large.  This is our best estimate.  We haven't given the nature of the exercise. uncertainty

Could I put those on this? MR. BULLARD.  Could I map some of the confidence bands that are around, say, the consensus forecast exercise?

think so because those are, in some sense, unconditional shocks that could years.  This is saying, this is, in effect, the outcome, given a particular MR. ENGLISH.  I don't confidence bands.  Those confidence bands would be relative to all sorts of play out over the next few way that the economy plays out.

Okay.  So we're not putting them on the picture, but we think that wide. MR. BULLARD. they're pretty

Yes. MR. ENGLISH.

I'm not saying that's truth. model would give

path, one of the I mentioned yesterday is that because of long-run neutrality there should be payback so that unemployment is temporarily lower, but then later it must be temporarily does seem as though it is going to show up about 2020.  Is that a fair way to think about this-that, yes, you can temporarily you can't permanently lower the path of unemployment? MR. BULLARD.  I have one more question.  On the unemployment things periods higher-these often don't show up in this picture.  It here starting at lower unemployment, but is correct, because the unemployment rate throughout MR. WILCOX.  I don't think that the adjustment period is above the NAIRU, and so if we were driving unemployment materially below the NAIRU, it would have to come back up ultimately to the NAIRU.  But are you suggesting that there would be some sort of a stock of payback?

MR. BULLARD.  This looks like a permanent effect on unemployment.  Is that what we're seeing?

MR. WILCOX.  No, I don't think so.

we're not you those.  They're all converging.  The unemployment rate is converging to just a few years after 2020, and inflation is going to 2 percent. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  The simulations go out through 2075 [laughter], but showing 5½ percent there's no permanent effect.  It's 5½ percent either way. MR. WILCOX.  And

The policies in both cases are designed to cause the an unemployment rate of and inflation at 2 percent. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Yes. economy to settle down at the assumed equilibrium, which is 5½ percent

Is that what It's all monotonic convergence. MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  So you're saying there's monotonic convergence. you're saying?

July 31-August 1, 2012

Is there any wobble?  The wobbles, I think, are what you're past 2020.  They are very tiny; they're irrelevant. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. talking about.  There are wobbles

MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  The model is built to not change the natural rate of unemployment so that there's no permanent tradeoff.

MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Sure-yes.

you provide a more aggressive policy in some unemployment in other phases of the business you would otherwise have if you did not provide that.  The business cycle would you get the same average over a long time.  So we must be attenuating the cycle. MR. BULLARD.  So this means that if phases of the business cycle, you can have higher cycle than what go like this, the unemployment rate would go like this, and then you would attenuate that cycle, and that's how

MR. WILCOX.  No.

you're not, then you have a permanent tradeoff. MR. BULLARD.  If

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No.  You're filling in the gap.

simply filling in a gap along the adjustment trajectory. MR. WILCOX.  You're

MR. ENGLISH.  Yes, I think it really is just faster convergence back to potential.

I'd like to see longer-term simulations of the model, and you show me policy or something and then under a better unemployment dynamics over a very long period of time where the change but the business cycle is attenuated through our policy.  That's what I'd MR. BULLARD. how the economy would behave, say, under poor policy, and show me the average doesn't prefer to see.

I can send those to you. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.

President Lacker, you had a two-hander? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.

I think you were two forecasts, but it's around the marginal effect.  Now, I would just point out that the intermediate steps in constructing that would involve crucially this estimate of LSAP on longer-term yields.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Of course.

LACKER. It wasn't my impression that those were estimated terribly precisely, and around these MR. so I'm not sure why we'd suspect that the error bands would be very tight differential effects.

I was just making a narrow comment.  You don't take into So in the methodology used here, given the coefficients, just hitting the equations with shocks.  Then that uncertainty you are referring to, which CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. account coefficient uncertainty, right? you are is real, would not be captured in that exercise-that's all I'm saying.

yet another MR. LACKER.  Right.  Well, the coefficient uncertainty in the model is source of uncertainty.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Of course.

There with the forward I is certainly a risk, and maybe a material probability, that the conditions we've seen recently might not improve or could become more pronounced.  So I'm comfortable lean signaled in the alternative B language.

In my another LSAP is a momentous one and requires a careful would expect the ultimate tradeoff I currently prefer the open-ended option because I think the two approaches.  I think it has the better chance of expending fewer should have restrained expectations for another LSAP round.  Lower and more liquidity are unlikely to move the needle much.  A boost to risky asset period but won't alter fundamentals, in my lower rates and higher risky asset prices will probably help and will produce improvement of economic conditions over what would have transpired in the not projecting inflation so measurably below a new LSAP as similar in purpose to LSAP 2.  At the same time, I see the If the risks were to materialize as apparent in the near term.  If the Committee decides to Because next meeting, I think the policy options in alternative A should be the focus of discussion in this round.  Obviously, either of the two options of view, the decision to undertake weighing of benefits versus costs.  On consideration, I between benefits and costs to boil down to one of limited benefits opposite uncertain costs, but in most respects, manageable risks. commitment to keep applying accommodation until satisfactory conditions have been achieved is the stronger and more flexible of the producing meaningful results.

A, and, like Lockhart, I am going to use my time to talk about alternative A, because I do think that wording right is important.  At our last meeting, the situation called for action, and we goals remain stalled unless we take further, more-significant action.  In the Tealbook, the MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I strongly favor alternative President getting the took a step in that direction.  The news since then confirms that progress toward our policy will likely

Simply put, such an outcome is inconsistent with path that brings us measurably closer to our actions described and extending the forward guidance to midunemployment inflation remains below appropriate monetary policy.  We need to be on a goals over the forecast horizon.  To accomplish that, we should take the strong in alternative A, including further asset purchases 2015; I also favor lowering the interest rate on reserves to 15 basis points.

One is that we should wait confirmation that the economy has lost momentum, and the second is that we dry, saving it in case we go over the fiscal cliff or Europe implodes.  But find neither argument for inaction compelling.

I can go along with pushing this off until the next meeting, but only making matters worse. for now, if we're

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard.

you, Mr. Chairman.  Just to follow up on this DSGE analysis, I I would do going forward is to put the about what the differences are between various assumptions.  One of the explicit models is that you can actually talk about where disagreements also think that the notion that the flex price equilibrium is a very smooth one, and the can argue about what kinds of assumptions have to be made might think that we're like to go in that direction; maybe that's can discuss.  Of course, this has been a long-running issue in macroeconomics, but central banks do it this way, and I think it would be good for this Committee as MR. BULLARD.  Thank do appreciate that there's a suite of models, but what DSGE model front and center in the staff analysis.  And I think that would facilitate debate around the table advantages of putting out are.  I sticky price equilibrium is way off from the flex price equilibrium, is hard to swallow.  But if we put the model on the table, then we to get that kind of result, and then what kinds of welfare improvements we getting with our policy action.  So I'd very much something we I think other well.

alternative B.  I prefer to keep the 'late 2014' date for now. B, already says 'at least through late 2014,' so I think and it's wise to put that in there.  In general, if we're going to put dates For today, I'm supporting The language, as it stands in alternative that gives us some cover

July 31-August 1, 2012

argued against it-I'm in favor of changing the date with the data.  And I can and then feel as though we shouldn't have pushed the date back.  I think we could 'at least' in front of the in the statement-I have really, I'd be willing to change it at every meeting-move it up or move it back.  But appreciate that not everyone wants to be that flexible about changing the date, and for that reason, it might be prudent to wait until the September meeting.  We don't want to get some stronger data wait until September to change that, partly because we have the cover of 'late 2014.'

Committee is not so clear to me.  I low.  We're benefiting from an extreme flight-to-safety effect and wait to see what happens.  I agree that the getting the flight-to-safety effect, I think that we may not have action the way that people are talking about.  I usually don't like policy coordination I am struck by the idea that Fed easing is not helping the situation in easing aggressively.  If we stand pat, that's going to, all else being equal, make the situation in a key-something I like to cite.  But on the other economy, and we probably don't a substantive step at the last meeting.  I think a tenet of central banking is, what happens after you take an easing action.  We do have two jobs reports and the next meeting. The urgency of considering further action for this think that rates are already globally, and I think we can put that in our pocket economy is not looking as good as we'd like, and everyone has been talking about that over the last day or so.  But because we're to be taking arguments.  However, Europe.  Europe is where the recession is; in principle, they should be ease aggressively and they Europe worse.  Again, I think that isn't always hand, I think this EU situation is the key problem in the global want to take steps that would be counterproductive on that dimension.  We did take what the Chairman has termed you wait and see between now

And if you look at what was going on at that time, all measures of Some were extremely low-below 1 percent measured from a year Those trending down all through the first three quarters of 2010.  We're not really in I can read the inflation and inflation expectations data, they are really pretty close to to see more evidence on that dimension to see that the deflation threat I don't think it's that clear at this stage that some kind of large action will be required at the next meeting in September.  In my view, inflation and inflation expectations are nothing like they were in the inflation were quite low. earlier-and inflation expectations measured in the TIPS market had fallen dramatically. indicators were that situation now.  It could develop into that, and I definitely would want to keep an eye on that. But as far as our target.  And I'd want was more real than it appears right at this juncture.

A.  In this respect, I actually agree with President Lockhart, and many others around the table.  I think that this is much closer times, where the Committee will help us enormously to get into a pattern that reestablishes the continuity in monetary critical that this Committee gets out of the crisis mode and gets reaction to incoming data that characterizes good steps creates thresholds for action, which a juncture when the data are going in a different direction from If we did take further action, I have been an advocate of doing a meeting-by-meeting flow approach, as outlined in alternative Williams, President to the way the Committee behaves in the nostalgic normal adjust its policy instruments a little bit in response to subtle changes in economic conditions.  It would also policy.  I see it as absolutely more into the stable and sensible, measured monetary policy.  The notion of taking very large confuse markets.  It tends to put out end dates, which have haunted the Committee because the end dates seem to always occur at the one that the Committee would prefer, and in those senses, I think, have been very

July 31-August 1, 2012

counterproductive.  So if we did take further action, I think it would be wise to take the meetingby-meeting approach.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I think you'll hear from my words that I as much as what yesterdayIn terms of policy, I'm I'll make a brief suggestion shock perspective for policy-the idea that it has economy.  And I'll close alternative A. little bit here and try to don't think the perspective we bring to why we are stuck in the mud matters we're communicating about what we're likely to do about being stuck in the mud.  I think-and this links back to comments that Governor Yellen made about Qvigstad's criterion

why those tensions Anyway, I hope that was helpful in the way of context. that the Committee's communications about how it's likely to deal with tensions between unemployment and inflation are more important than how one approaches might exist.

brief suggestion on alternative B.  In paragraph 4, I would that the reference to 'financial developments' be dropped.  I think we're as those developments affect our ability to term 'economic Let me talk first about a recommend strongly only interested in financial developments insofar achieve the dual mandate.  I think that interest is readily subsumed in the developments.'

economic go-round that additional accommodation would be largely trying to we're facing a supply shock, we face a traditional dual policy to lower the unemployment rate well below 8 percent will table 2 on consensus forecast memo.  And I think we see it on page 1 of the monetary policy got today.  Table 2 of the consensus forecast memo implies that something like years.  So table 2 helps to frame the policy I can see.  First, what that the answer to that is, we would have to pay about 15 or own view would be that the price could well be I think we should be talking about that.  It's more that I think that's what the Now, let me turn to my supply shock perspective and its implications for policy.  I suggested in the offset a supply shock.  And because mandate conflict.  Using require PCE core inflation to rise above target.  We actually see exactly this tension in page 2 of the handout that we the additional accommodation in alternative A would reduce unemployment but would lead inflation to rise as high as 2.2 percent in four or five debate, I think, in a useful way.  The debate has two pieces to it, as far as kind of inflation price do we think that we have to pay to reduce unemployment by 30 or 40 basis points?  Table 2 suggests 20 basis points of inflation.  Now, my considerably higher than that.  I don't consider my own view necessarily determinative in any way, but

July 31-August 1, 2012

I promised in my labor market slack memo that circulated before the meeting, we'll be work in Minneapolis to follow up on this issue. conversation should be about-what inflation price do we have to pay to reduce unemployment? And as trying to do some survey given the price of inflation, how much of an unemployment reduction I argued last fall, I think we really should be working harder We will use a balanced At a minimum, I think such an approach forecast, which forecasts that core inflation will stay at or below we adopt a policy like alternative B. The second part of our debate is about our objective functions over inflation and unemployment.  That is, are we willing to purchase?  And as to establish some commonality in the answers to this question.  Now, to give credit to the work we've done, we said in January something on exactly this issue: approach to the two elements of the dual mandate. would imply that under appropriate policy, inflation should rise at least somewhat above 2 percent if unemployment is above a level that the Committee views as desirable.  This is in contrast to the consensus 2 percent if

debate in terms of inflation and unemployment tradeoffs flows on alternative A.  Alternative A offers a wide array of to follow through by delivering stimulus over a relatively long period credible.  For example, the consensus forecast is that, under appropriate This framing of our policy naturally into my closing comments possible additional accommodation, but all of those tools require the public to perceive the Committee as being ready of time.  Given current Committee thinking and current Committee communication, I do not see such follow-through as monetary policy, the Committee believes that the unemployment rate will be 7.6 percent in 2014 and the core inflation rate will be 1.8 percent.  To the public, and really to ourselves, this forecast is saying that even though unemployment might be as high as 7.6 percent, the Committee sees it as inappropriate to provide additional accommodation, because such accommodation would lead

July 31-August 1, 2012

a little bit of nuance here.  The goal here is to try to communicate something about away?  That's really, what are the conditions when the Fed will start to take If we communicate that we're not going to take the punch bowl away that signals to people that they don't have to save as much today, about conditions being as bad in the future, and that will actually through higher I view those as modest.  Really, the kick is, things are going to be today than you might have thought, because the Fed is going to allow more of a party to you don't have to save as much for the future.  But that's a nuance. core inflation to exceed 1.8 percent.  Now, I want to try to offer goal here is not to generate inflation.  The how much of a party we're going to allow to happen on our watch.  That is, when do we want to take the punch bowl the punch bowl away? until unemployment is low, they don't have to worry stimulate more demand today.  There are some effects on real interest rates inflation expectations, but better take place, and that means the consensus forecast that we're offering, is you look at exhibit 1 of the consensus forecast memo-this is the one with charts-there's a significant probability that PCE core inflation will be above that the Committee is likely to by curtailing accommodation.  As I've said, I see us as facing a that before undertaking the steps in A, the Committee needs to be able to communicate credibly that it's committed to in the face of above-target inflation.  I don't see the consensus with unemployment being 7.6 percent as long as inflation is not above 1.8 percent.  I don't if the public believes that the Committee's future choices The forecast that we offer, and communicating to the public that the Committee is just not all that committed to monetary accommodation.  If all of the fan 2 percent in 2013.  And the consensus forecast seems to suggest react to such an outcome persistent shock to aggregate supply.  That means alternative pursuing low unemployment forecast as being consistent with that, because it says that the Committee, in 2014 at least, will be happy think alternative A can be effective

That's a negative way to The effectiveness of alternative A could be statement.  And such communication will only be credible if the Committee's current governed by this balanced approach.

B, with one critical exception, which is the forward guidance language.  My yesterday afternoon emphasized the enormous uncertainty associated with your know whether back to pre-recession long-run trend potential whether potential has suffered a one-time downward level shift and we're now tracking a new amount of uncertainty associated with point forecasts of the GDP growth in 2014 goes from 0 to 6 percent in the consensus forecast one model and just rule.  The uncertainty about future policy-settings is staggering as well.  As we are quite flat years.  A 70 percent confidence interval for liftoff in the Tealbook, for as early 2016 to as early as this meeting.  The net result MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have little problem with the language in alternative comments forecast, and you echoed that in your statement this morning, Mr. Chairman.  At present, we do not have a collective view about the amount of slack in the economy.  The natural rate could be anywhere, in our collective view, from 5 to 8 percent.  Moreover, we don't economic growth is bound to pick up and bring us or lower trend line.  A staggering economy is well illustrated in the fan charts and the staff memos.  For example, the 90 percent confidence band for real memo.  And that even understates uncertainty because it conditions on just one policy discussed yesterday, staff calculations of the distribution of future liftoff dates across a number of example, appears to run from as far out

July 31-August 1, 2012

this meeting and participation yesterday has given me a deeper efforts to foresee future policy choices.  The late 2014, or even 2015, now seem to me less I well, because, first, it's and, second, we've not been consistently describing it that way.  And it's us raise rates forward-guidance language in B at this meeting.  I think we should omit the description of the time period over conditions will warrant an exceptionally low of my preparations for appreciation of the uncertainty attending our implication for me is that liftoff dates as far out as implausible than they once did.  However, the provision of forward guidance via a calendar-based modal forecast now seems even more problematic to me than it once did.  If our forward guidance is simply a forecast designed to help the public understand what we foresee, think it's problematic the way it's forecasted now, because it implies a spurious and overinflated sense of precision.  If our forward guidance is a commitment designed to convince the public we'll do something we might otherwise not do, I think it's problematic as not written that way; not clear it's a sensible commitment to make, given how often simulated rules have before then.  So, accordingly, I'd oppose the inclusion of alternative which the Committee anticipates that economic level of the federal funds rate.

implications of an appreciation of the profound uncertainty-which you In the past, we've taken actions with our effective they would be.  I been very reluctant to undercut the potential effectiveness of those emphasizing in public the limits to our understanding of those effects.  And so I think I think we really we think the effectiveness is and, in some effectiveness of our balance The broader highlighted, Mr. Chairman-are relevant here as well. balance sheet under a tremendous amount of uncertainty about how think that we've naturally actions by the public comes to believe that we have more faith in their effectiveness than do.  This has promoted an inflated view of what quarters, an inflated view in the public's mind about the potential

I think that this has come to promote a sense that and more capable of influencing unemployment and the path of are, than we really collectively think we are, and it promotes expectations that we should act at times.  It's fine to say 'whatever it takes,' but you with a sense of what we're capable of.  If it's like getting blood from a going to do whatever it takes to get blood from a stone is communication strategy, and in some sense, it's literally quixotic. sheet actions we are more responsible unemployment than we really widespread need to accompany that stone, then to say that we're counterproductive as a

Lockhart's urging to discuss the options in A is correct, because they'll get some serious consideration at our next meeting.  I think that the probability of an effect on economic growth is negligible; conditional on it having an growth, it's quite likely it will have an effect on inflation.  And when I consider what I naturally gravitate to the last 30 years of empirical you've done, Mr. Chairman-that produces estimates of the impulse consisting of a transitory effect on real activity and a permanent and sustained effect I've seen any reason to doubt that the general pattern would hold I think that an LSAP of a substantial size is quite likely to complicate our exit easy to just mention that and go on.  But picture and our asset holdings yields now with the interest rate on reserves at 25 basis points.  But with the interest trillion excess reserve balance when the interest rate a lot of confidence that it President obviously LSAP having a material effect on effect a monetary stimulus could have, work-including some response as on inflation.  And I'm not sure in this case. strategy, and sometimes, at times like this, it is that process where we're raising the interest rate on excess reserves.  We have a sense, I think, but a very rough sense, of how the size of our excess reserve balances affect other rate on reserves at 25 basis points, zero is not far away.  Picture trying to assess, based on the experience we have now, the effect of a $2 on reserves is up at 2, 3, 4 percent.  Now, I don't think we have

July 31-August 1, 2012

yields despite the interest rate on excess going to need to be flexible; we're going to need to be agile. going to end up being in reducing the size of our balance our initial attempts don't reduce the balance sheet rapidly enough that it is just going to be a more complicated process the more trillions we add to our balance wouldn't put a substantial depressing effect on other reserves being high.  And we're We're likely to start slower than we're sheet.  I think we'll find that and sheet.

That analysis That there's some identifiable, correctable impediment we're is a much more difficult case to make now.  I don't think that's what motivates this. good reasons.  It would be quite clearly a fiscal I could imagine someone trying to make the case that this is not credit choosing whom to lend to.  But not all borrowers in on banks for credit.  Many large corporations go directly to credit We ought to ask ourselves whether this is withdrawing or flow of credit to someone else.  So I'd be skeptical about a 'funding for lending' 'Funding for lending' has come up at this meeting.  As that with deep, deep skepticism.

over the next year and a half or the medium term is little changed since maintained my forecast for 2013 and 2014 at about 3 percent, and I at the horizon of 18 months to two years is a better horizon for which policy result, I see no further need for another round accommodation, either in the form of increased asset purchases, as in alternative A, or the date of forward guidance, as in alternative B.  And there has been a by President Lacker and others about that. MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Taking on board the recent data, my outlook for the economy June.  For example, I've believe that looking ought to be judged, and ought to be the relevant metric we should look at.  I'm very dubious that we can do very much in the very short term.  As a of policy in the form of extending lot of conversation already estimate for 2012 quarter-two real GDP came in a little stronger than economy does not look particularly worse and has Tealbook estimate, but the data in hand suggest a somewhat stronger activity in the first half of the year than the Tealbook and the baseline forecast.  The my outlook is similar to last time as well, and I do not believe we have I believe is very large, or U.S. fiscal policy.  Moreover, I think it's can do something that markets and others to In terms of interest rates, savefar more to lower long-term rates than we could ever hope to do with any The BEA's advance what was projected in the July Tealbook that we've been discussing, and at about the pace the staff predicted in June.  So by this metric, the not really deteriorated over the intermeeting period.  Of course, this first estimate may well get revised down toward the pace of uncertainty surrounding an effective monetary policy antidote to the negative effects of high uncertainty surrounding the European debt crisis, which dangerous and misleading to suggest to the public and the markets that we we cannot do.  I think we're in danger of overplaying our hand, leading the believe that we can accomplish goals that we cannot achieve. haven flows have done

yet-or that a financial crisis materializes and we are likely to be in stimulating economic activity in the current environment.  I am of the announcement I don't believe that tweaking the relative price of particular assets is likely going to of expanding the balance sheet further, impact our independence.  Second, if the action is largely ineffective in credibility is eroded.  Third, a larger balance sheet will of policy and make it more difficult for us to Fourth, if financial markets come to believe that policy will lead to risks, aggressive of the type mentioned in alternative A, are actually adding risks to the any, short-term benefit.  We've spent too little time, in my view, My own threshold for further easing continues to be that the risk of deflation becomes very significant, and thus we must act to defend our inflation goal-and, as President Bullard mentioned, I don't think we are at that point require significant effort on our part to shore up financial markets.  The cost-benefit analysis suggests that the bar should be high for further expansions of our balance sheet.  There's a growing body of evidence that raises questions in my mind about how effective large-scale asset purchases thinking about uncertainties, as we've been discussing, over the magnitude effects that large-scale asset purchases have and over whether or not they are transitory or more persistent. solve the 'muck' that our economy is in.  And the costs though hard to quantify, are real nonetheless.  First, we will have more portfolio risk, which I believe could negatively stimulating the broader real economy, our complicate our exit strategies in the renormalization stay ahead of the curve. higher inflation or that we are deliberately seeking to fund large fiscal deficits, we could find ourselves in an even more challenging economic and political situation-again, including our independence.  Thus, I'm concerned that rather than mitigating downside further actions, especially economy for minimal, if

July 31-August 1, 2012

risks that our policies actually impose on the economy and what those longer term for economy as a whole.  We are in uncharted territory, and discussing the downside actions might imply, either of the unintended nature or intended nature, over the ourselves as an institution and for the our actions do impose risks that we must take into account.  I think we've been too cavalier in the way we've treated those.

you know, I've been uncomfortable since the start with forward guidance to shape expectations about policy.  I continue to can in terms of staterules, even if they are qualitative in nature, which is what the The briefing on simple policy Lacker about the staff's work on the distribution and uncertainty over optimal liftoff in the case where we ignore model uncertainty and confine about the I don't believe that the time-contingent language in sense of that uncertainty.  Moreover, I think that switching the from 2014 to mid-2015, as in one of the options in B, is misleading regarding the Turning to statement language, as the use of calendar-date believe that it's important to describe our policy actions as much as we contingent, systematic Kocherlakota, Plosser, and Williams effort is trying to illustrate. rules underscores why we should be wary of calendar dates, and I'll echo the remarks of President dates.  This is highly uncertain even ourselves to the FRB/US model.  Our best analysis suggests significant uncertainty date when we'll need policy tightening, and alternative B contains any calendar date lack of precision with which we can gauge liftoff-again, as indicated by the analysis of the staff.

It now reads, 'The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on Bill English indicated, are likely to read this as saying that we are now Finally, I'm very uncomfortable with the changes alternative economic and financial developments and will provide additional accommodation as needed.'

I think again, this gets back to the path is best laid out in terms of what we are at the next meeting. economy performs between now and September.  I might add that given I believe are retarding economic growth, I don't expect a and September.  And nothing we are likely to do now or change that path between now and early next year.  In my judgment, to will act unless we are getting significant improvement in employment would be retarding factors are beyond our ability to mitigate with monetary you want to call them aggregate demand or aggregate supply shocks.  Put it would take a significant deterioration in the outlook, not simply committed to doing something in September.  In my in September is the wrong kind of forward guidance.  If September, our discussion around this table and the policy decision are whether we want to disappoint market participants going to do QE3.  And if this is a dangerous commitment and a dangerous signal to send.  Once idea that in the interest of transparency, our policy conditioning our policy actions on, not pre-committing to doing something Instead of this language, I strongly recommend that we keep the language that we used in June and wait to see how the the uncertainties and other factors that great deal of improvement between now in September is likely to signal that we mistaken, because the primary policy actions, whether another way, in my view, disappointing progress, to warrant more accommodation.

I favor alternative A today agree with the views that Kocherlakota and his comments about how emphasizing our balanced approach to our monetary policy strategy would really enhance the

That's what our strategy prefer the flow version of the asset purchases with a clearly stated economic conditionality.  That seems most consistent with analyses indicating that strong accommodation is beneficial today. The composition of any asset purchases is important, but frankly, for me, the signaling component that it adds to our forward guidance is policy action like that.  I actions today in order to study the composition effects, and I do favor percentages of the purchases.

defense that we have against adverse shocks that may be coming today.  We've seen a latter are clearly faster rate, and, it seems to me that it running a couple of tenths below are to be evaluated symmetrically, it's a wash when it comes to And on the point that President Kocherlakota mentioned about how there's an inflation agree with that.  But I would state it more in terms of, against these policy goal variable developments, and so Frankly, I think the best our way is to have the most resilient economy possible; we don't have that host of, I think, very credible analyses saying that more-aggressive accommodation of various forms would yield a better outcome.  For example, this is clear in the trial-run consensus forecast's analyses that the Chairman discussed yesterday.  Comparing outcomes under the consensus policy assumption with those under alternative A, we see that the better outcomes.  Alternative A would bring unemployment down to the range that we've judged to be sustainable, but it would come down at a significantly would do so with no worse of an inflation outcome.  Instead of our target, inflation would run a couple of tenths above that target.  Because we've said that deviations around the target inflation. price for bringing unemployment down, I we really need marginal utility pricing we need a policy loss function.  When the unemployment rate is 8.2 percent, a reduction in the

July 31-August 1, 2012

close to its goal variable and it doesn't change in relation to its goal, the policy unemployment rate is unbelievably valuable.  The marginal utility of that's very high, but when inflation is very cost is much lower.  I would think the cost-benefit analysis would run that way.

asked yesterday whether, if we were doing the consensus forecast rather than as a trial run, we would be showing the public the forecast I saw a sense of relief from some in the room when But why would that be?  For me, I public saw the two outcomes side by side, it would be very difficult to consensus outlook with no additional actions relative to alternative A.  These are good once again thank Governor such views to some extent in her speeches.  Of course, anyone alternative A may feel that the Board staff analysis underlying I thought take than the Board staff on some particular issue.  I personally have Board analyses to be among the very best I've ever seen.  There's a lot of accumulated cutting-edge technique, embedded in these forecasts and As a result, the Board staff has a pretty good track record relative to other and Romer have written papers on that, and other analyses have documented It seems to me that most alternative views are more of the nature of opinions and that there's not really a good paper trail for these go back to our discussions about structural unemployment, where we had I believe that someone exercise for real today under the alternative policies.  And I thought you, Mr. Chairman, said, 'No, we would not be doing that.' think it's because, if the defend the analyses and viewpoints that should be communicated publicly, and I Yellen for publicizing unsympathetic toward embracing the projected outcomes for that alternative is somehow lacking.  That's understandable. Humility is very important, of course.  There have been some times over the years that I might have had a better found the macroeconomic wisdom, as well as analyses. forecasters-Romer that as well. discretionary judgment; it seems to me alternative analyses.  I

Finally, there's a After all, our balance sheet is very large.  Surely history will credit the smartest policy player in we could do.

Just a quick comment on the pricing issue for inflation.  I utilities have to be taken into account.  I was trying to do that by thinking relative prices with the slope of the objective function, but you could do you were doing them in terms of just weighting things by marginal utilities.

The almost all participants at this table, inflation is running at or below the I learned a lot from listening to yesterday's conversation.  I heard a few key points, in addition to the fact that dressage my friend Narayana, who seems to have an encyclopedic memory for first is that, according to

We've had six-month trimmed mean has been either running at 1.9 percent.  From Governor Duke, I learned a new phrase, I agree with that, reminded placed on state and local governments, particularly with regard to their a very helpful intervention with regard to the to corporate balance sheets.  There has been of existing debt; the present value of future cost flows has turned higher as rates have has obviously lifted stock prices, at least for the 50 percent of believe that 50 percent do not.  This fed into was very helpful as a reminder-that from a are.  I also learned, of course, that we're contemplating alternative A.  I I believe we're deciding We'll go with B, and we'll have a very strong bias toward A at our next meeting.  There's and earlier this morning that 2 percent level.  I did not comment on inflation yesterday.  Last night, we did go through the revised BEA data to work on our the trimmed trimmed mean has been remarkably steady in the month-to-month wiggles, as we did this most recent reporting period, but no indication of significant drift either upward or downward.  The 1.7 or 1.8 or 1.9 or 2 percent.  And the 12-month rate has flattened out somewhat toward the end of 2011, but it's currently which will become immortal in economic parlance:  'The economy is cruddy.' particularly the short-term outlook for job creation.  And from Governor Raskin, I was of the stress that is pension funds.  Governor Stein, I thought, gave salutary effects that have occurred with respect refinancing come down.  One infers-and I asked a question of Simon on this, and we'll explore this further-that our policy households that do own stocks or mutual funds.  I Vice Chairman Dudley's point-which I thought financial standpoint, in terms of our banks and our corporations, we are perhaps in better shape than we might think we thought Governor Yellen basically summarized the case, which is what today: a presumption from the conversation we had with Simon yesterday

July 31-August 1, 2012

of Treasuries with a of greater than 10 years, the presumption being that we won't hinder the market I'm very skeptical about that on the sell side, if we are indeed successful in reviving the economy. we will end up with a program that will have us holding roughly 40 percent maturity functioning on the buy side.  I should say that particularly if things appreciate, and I think we really need to consider what hindrance there might be to an exit policy

I heard yesterday.  I want to underscore the fact that, despite my I am worried about is the we've just come done.  Again, going back to Governor Stein's comments yesterday, existing debt-that's become very highly attractive for the private sector.  And of asset prices-again, if you happen to own them-which has been for the wealth function. So that's what reputation, I am not worried about inflation in the short term.  What efficacy of job creation.  I've summarized for myself the positives of what through and what we've we're financing another benefit is the lifting beneficial our policy thus far.  First, negative real are killing savers in order to bail out over-indebted borrowers.  Second, as pointed are becoming more and more dangerously and local level.  That threatens the retirements of many especially state and local governments and set interest rates misallocate capital, result in mal-investment, and and manipulate markets.  Fourth, the pricing mechanism or discovery mechanism is cost of money is fake, which I believe it is.  Fifth, massive monetary inflation is box.  As I said earlier, I don't think it's a short-term issue, but I'm very long term.  Sixth, the deeper we dig in, the harder it is going to be to a significant risk of capital losses.  I know I'd like to talk for a minute about the negatives of interest rates out by Governor Raskin yesterday, pension funds underfunded, particularly at the state individuals, the balance sheets of companies, and unions.  Third, artificially distort damaged if the price inflation in a tinder concerned about it over the climb out.  As President Pianalto mentioned, there is

That is, if I was outside this room with only I would.  First of all, there won't be an SEP from this By expressing the new purchase program ourselves the flexibility to adjust the pace of purchases, the length of time continue, and the mix of securities purchased.

Still, I kept reading paragraph A(3) over and over and trying $1 trillion of assets if the statement to go by, I'm not sure

July 31-August 1, 2012

as a guide.  But if there was, looking at the consensus forecast, would a reduction by the end of 2013-or, looking at the Tealbook in 2013-constitute sustained improvement in labor markets? frame for purchase and think that part of the problem stems from having one expressed as as a date.  We've talked a lot at this meeting about rules for the fed purchases.  If and we want to do more, how will that 'more' be communicated?  We end date or expected?  Should a pushout of the fed funds liftoff be I'm happy to vote for more purchases, but I'd like to understand how we plan to the flexibility that this and communicate that use so that the public can form better expectations conditions, just as they do now with the we can't articulate how we would use this flexibility to gain advantages over a meeting to use in unemployment from 8.2 to 7.9 percent baseline, from 8.3 to 8.1 percent Or would the language about sustained improvement in labor markets indicate purchases through the end of 2014, a purchase of $2 trillion or more, to someone looking at the SEP?  Furthermore, I'm disturbed that there seems to be no real connection between the time the date of first liftoff.  I conditions and the other funds rate, but not much about the interaction of liftoff, exit, and the end of conditions deteriorate have room to increase the pace, but how would we communicate an extension of the an increase in the total purchases interpreted as an extension of the purchases?  That is, should we lash the two together using the exit strategy? use this last good tool to best effect.  I'd like to discuss how we would use statement gives us about purchases in the face of improving or deteriorating fed funds rate.  If formulation such as 3′ , then we probably should go back to 3′ , which at least has the advantage of familiarity.

I'm afraid that without any explanation, it could appear forecast, I didn't see I'll turn next to the extension of the forward guidance to mid-2015.  I don't necessarily have a problem with extending it, but somewhat random.  Looking at the Tealbook baseline and the consensus

July 31-August 1, 2012

If the dot pattern in the September SEP looks pretty it did in June, then moving out the date changes the message about our policy in relation again, I found the staff memos to be especially helpful in thinking about bound to delay liftoff we could improve their effectiveness with a relatively simple adjustment, it seems as though that would be modification to our individual favorite rules in their projections, but that as a Committee a decision to delay expected liftoff beyond what would normally be called for.  Either would be an important step to explain why the date was much change in the much as to the projections.  Once this.  The suggestion that simple rules could be modified at the zero lower in order to avoid a return to the zero lower bound seems both sensible and explainable to me. Simple rules have the advantage of simplicity, so surely, if at the zero lower bound good, too.  Maybe we could agree to make such a and apply them to our individual forecasts to come up with fed funds projections.  Or we might agree that everyone would use their favorite rules we'd make way, communication of that change moving.

Our Truth in Savings regulations don't even have a The third action contemplated in alternative A is a reduction in the action that would go negative, and that we are not prepared for those negative rates or for large dollars stampeding from one instrument to another.

In explaining my position, I want to try to emulate Narayana and we slip into more of a side and get a bit arguments on our side.  And I think a number of you did this today, but I MR. TARULLO.  Thank contemplated in alternative A, although at present, neither of the formulations quite captures the way Betsy in being fair minded about the arguments on both sides.

That's why I said I'm not going to have a different view in September based on a few good pieces of data or a contemplates, to change my view that the economy is stuck. years, we're seeing graphic form, which is, we're at just about the Let me use the template that I think most of benefits, and costs for additional accommodation.  With respect to need, I be pretty apparent, based on my little exercise with the five propositions add that, to me, it 'stuckness' or the bogged-down quality of the economy, as that few above-expectations pieces of data.  It would take something really dramatic, which I don't think anybody around this table And as the Chairman noted, with the revisions in GDP over the last couple of that stuck quality in even more quantitatively same level of GDP growth.  If one thought that there's structural harm to the economy of the

One, I think with respect effect of the LSAP purchases that we've done in the past, the substantial weight of work or another suggests the papers emphasize there's still some disagreement-it does clear as I think we could expect at this point.  That doesn't mean that the benefits going to be the same going forward, and I think we just need to be straightforward in saying well be declining marginal utility with an additional dollar of LSAP purchases are going to become inoperative.  I think there's some that we ought to-and again, this is Let me move on to benefits.  I think the benefits question is really As Betsy said a minute straightforward discussion.  It's the fact of benefits part of the discussion more difficult. to the by people without an obvious institutional or political reason to go one way that there really has been an effect through different channels, and some of some channels more than others.  For me at least, while the empirical studies cannot obviously be dispositive-we haven't had that much experience; seem at least as are that.  There may as interest rate spreads are more and more compressed.  That doesn't mean, though, that some of the channels that have been operative substantial reason to believe that they still will be operative.  It's just a question of how much we may expect.  For some of those very reasons, it seems to me

got remaining.  And that, to me, argues echoing Betsy-try to maximize the effect of what we've for doing the most that we can reasonably do, on the one hand, and bundling various policy measures together, on the other.

you may recall that a year and a half or two years ago, I said I thought we were of needing to 'throw a maiden over the cliff to the dragon' at every useful way to go forward and communicate. guidance today would be slipping back into that pattern, so I'd be as much together as we can reasonably and effects both on actual market functioning and on asked policy axiom that you fire if you've got at all because we're using LSAPs?'  And there might be an argument But as Janet pointed LSAP might actually be diminished further in a context in which there was to maximize the insulating effect by using concern is whether we then look as though we're impotent 'Well, we've run out of at least substantial we would deploy If there were not those effects, then we might congratulate Some of slipping into the practice meeting, and I didn't think that was a particularly Changing the date in the opposed to it.  I do think, though, that pulling responsibly would be a way to maximize the confidence and the psychology of markets and consumers regarding our actions.  With respect to that, I think that the psychology is probably one of the arguments for holding fire, and I've myself the question 'Should the normal monetary ammunition be different for that proposition, particularly with Europe looming in the background. out, the utility of the substantial flight to quality, and so we'd want to try that tool right now.

July 31-August 1, 2012

I've listened, not just today but over the course of the last couple of concerned, rightly, about:  inflation, as a central bank.  On inflation, with all due respect to I do find the arguments a little conclusory. out in the indefinite future, as I've heard it, an enormous amount of linear analysis that gets us from here to I have to say, I've tested this proposition on a fairly I wasn't completely set at ease by the staff memo, glad that Bill and Eric and others have suggested that we need some more staff work and the September meeting.  I think this is a case in which it's useful to even if ultimately you say, 'Well, it wasn't the right voice,' because it is argumentation.  And lastly, I depart, I think, a little bit from what some of those who are inclined in my would want us to be saying that we will 'do what it because it isn't clear to me ultimately that we can do what it takes to solve the rather now.  My suggestion would be that we 'do what we can,' and that we will continue to do what we can, at each step of the way. Finally, costs.  As years, I think I hear three kinds of costs that people are market functioning, and credibility of us those who have made the argument, I must say that That is, the specter of runaway inflation sometime doesn't seem to me backed by there and where are the real problems.  And wide variety of non-Fed-mostly, but not exclusively, academic-economists, and even those who are on the hawkish side tend to be not too concerned about that particular prospect.  They are more concerned about the other two things.  The market functioning issue, I think, is a real one-again, for reasons that Betsy alluded to. and so I'm on that between now hear the dissonant voice a new kind of issue, and we really should have the benefit of all the on credibility, where policy direction have said.  I don't think I takes,' substantial economic problems that we face right communicate an intention to with the appropriate set of costs and benefits being taken into account

I missing any wording issues that we're supposed to address here? Mr. Chairman, am CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That's up to you.

July 31-August 1, 2012

If it's up to me, then I'm done. MR. TARULLO.  Okay.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Raskin.

for the most part, year, we publicly have sent the signal that we're about whether there really is slowing under way.  Now that we have mandate.  The data are as clear as they will ever be.  What is unclear to the public is the efficacy and them.  And so I think the public might benefit MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As the economic data have, continuously weakened over the course of the waiting for some clarity revised Q1 GDP data and a look at Q2, as well as six months of employment data, it seems clear that the economy has indeed slowed appreciably since the second half of 2011.  With that additional clarity, it seems to me that it isn't the data that is the rationale for not doing more to ensure that we're making progress toward achieving either leg of our dual probably calibration of our tools and how we intend to use from a shift in the conversation.

This may not be a weakness in the effective action is clear, but the necessary discussion is before taking new action.  There may not be Indeed, the prospects of poor prognosis and toward an explanation of what particular actions are intended to do.  This is no small task.  Obviously, central banks react to economic conditions.  They have extraordinary capacity to do this in an apolitical way if they're structured with both independence and accountability.  But in the realm of the unconventional, the zero lower bound, and constrained policymaking, the explanations of our tools.  Without such full explanations, the public and markets are confused and act in ways that tools, but a weakness in our communication to the public of what these policy tools are intended to do.  To me, the case for forceful and how to maximize the power of our communications

We're always can ever really be that the labor market isn't improving on its own anytime soon.  I January 2013 as some magical island from where the view is better and uncertainty has dissipated.  Moreover, I'm convinced by the work of the staff of capacity in the markets to take more action without impairing market functioning.  I don't think that market functioning is a reason to hesitate, but of course, I look forward to further work in this area.  On the more forceful and words, can we make good use of the Here, I'm attempts at rolling out new dinner items to the family.  I can throw chicken, salad, and potatoes-or I whichever route I that an a priori explanation will be demanded.  Similarly, there's a risk from the Chairman and others to explain how such a new tool or package of old tools effect than we I think the case for waiting can be made if it can improve our communications about new policy actions to economic participants.  In other intermeeting period to introduce new or newly packaged monetary policy tools? reminded of my previous together what is in the back of the refrigerator-the leftover can attempt the never-before-tried seafood bouillabaisse à la Provençal.  But go, let there be no doubt that announcing a new, bold policy tool or a package of less aggressive policy options without describing the thinking behind them may be interpreted by markets as a sign that we think the likelihood of an even worse economic outcome has significantly increased.  And without speeches would be effective, we could confuse the public and get less of a positive otherwise could.

This would with alternative B at this time, that's a I can support.  My support wouldn't be without reservations, because I think the signal to do so.  Neither of those are messages that I go with alternative B, I hope that members of this Committee will begin to action in alternative A groundwork for enacting that policy the next time we meet.  More action is characterized to the public as one that will be forceful and Thank you. In my view, an important part of the communication should be to make it clear that we're not taking this bold move because the contrary, we should indicate that this is the right policy to take because takes to get where we be a different content to communication than what has been usual here, and for me, if done correctly, justifies the lag in acting more quickly and decisively.  Therefore, if it's the decision of the members of this Committee that we should go decision that we may be sending to the public now will be that we're not concerned about meeting our mandate or that we think we don't have the ability want to send.  If we clearly talk publicly about the possibility of and rationale for the type of so that we have laid the important, I hope the policy effective.

Because whatever you think you're going to do, you're not going to do a whole lot in six weeks, and then suggests that a policy that keeps the tap flowing until we hit a particular labor market milestone is just not the right way to go.  To be concrete, suppose a year we are now-no improvement in labor markets; no overt signs of market dysfunction, eitherit's just nothing.  I think at that point, we'd have to say we've learned something: because the amount we have on our balance sheet course, conversely, if months so that there was on further relative to whatever labor market milestone in check.

I do-without really understanding the answers to those questions yet-favor a smaller tradeoff between pre-commitment and flexibility that what happens further in Europe.  I'm not persuaded at this point that the very risks.  In particular, we're not at the point now where we're were 30 years ago, as many will recall, but if we either way.

But I also understand that Governor Stein was talking about, and I remain very open minded about this during the intermeeting period.  In terms of other ideas that are on the table-IOER-I think we should wait and see modest benefits clearly outweigh the getting two-by-fours mailed to us the way we pick a fight with every small saver in the country, it's a big step in that direction, and that's what you're doing when you're going to negative deposit rates.

First, as long as we're sufficiently forward leaning, the as effective as the actual action at this meeting. our past LSAPs has crept into the market, advantages in terms of communication that the explain at the press conference.  Third, I think by being slightly more patient, we wait to see additional data, including two employment reports, that may reduce the among the Committee, and I think a greater consensus among the Committee could more effective in action.  So my default would be to move in September alternative A unless we see some meaningful improvement in the economic economic data.'  If you and it didn't change your outlook, you'd still want to move in September. There are several reasons for that. expected action in September will be nearly We've seen that in the past-as the expectation of most of the effect has actually happened before we've made our announcement.  Second, as other people have noted, September has the Chairman can can uncertainty about the outlook a little bit.

Two, market function would probably be somewhat less now than it was For example, I understand that the Treasury will soon be able to actually do negative able to do that before.  I think that's a significant alters that cost-benefit tradeoff somewhat.  And, three, we have to view this as period of time.  If I IOER rate was only going to be in place for six months and then we going to normalize monetary policy, then I'd say it wouldn't be worth the trouble in terms you think the policy is going to be in place for years, which is what we're saying, then you have to look at the one-time cost versus going to be realized over a much longer period of time. In terms of the interest on excess reserves rate actually changed over time.  Before, I was really it. were before, there's probably I think the disruption of earlier.

But if several benefits that are

However, we do have to be careful-and this goes to points made by around with In terms of alternative A, right now 3′ because open-ended intervention would be more powerful signal our Governor Stein-that we don't communicate paragraph 3 in a way that people view it as weaker, likely to be less, than what we're promising in 3′ .  And so I think we need to play

One thing to the holdings for at least some time period in paragraph 3.  That would make it so it would be greater than or equal to, rather than symmetric, as more powerful than 3′ . If we end up with a formulation on 3 that's weaker 3′ , then I'm going to flip over to favoring 3′ . So I think we need to work with that language alternative B language, this has really not been brought up, which is is bracketed.  The brackets are around 'and issues relating to U.S. fiscal I would prefer that coming out of the statement.  I don't really see what including it in statement accomplishes.

good case for accommodation for reasons I risk to not doing accommodation now; namely, much of it I also think that there are that we will have two labor market reports and other data between now and I would say that there was obviously a good bit of lack of clarity in terms of and discussed carefully.  These are, obviously, very important details, and I don't think gotten through them yet.  And as Governor Raskin and other people pointed out, is also a communications effort that needs to be developed as we consider how we're going we do decide, in fact, to go forward.  So I do, with some mixed feelings, Everything has been said.  I think there's a described.  And I think there's some will be in the form of criticism of the Fed for not fulfilling its mandate. some good reasons for waiting, and they've been mentioned.  We just took action with the MEP, and it will still be in place.  A number of our colleagues expressed a desire to see more data, and it is true mid-September. exactly which program we would use-the details, how would we communicate it, and what would be the effects on market functioning?  I think all of those things need to be laid out very carefully we quite have there to go forward if recommend waiting until September, and I recommend alternative B.

clear preference for leaving the 'late forward guidance as it is and not making that change.  So you should strike the I'm not quite sure when the SEP adds 2015, but I think that it In terms of other language, Vice Chairman Dudley was the only person to talk about the Humphrey-Hawkins I think the time to take it out would be when the fiscal cliff is resolved, whenever that are there strong views on either side? In terms of language, et cetera, there was a pretty 2014' 'mid-2015' option.  By the way, would be important for the SEP to add 2015 in September, just so we will get information on this issue. fiscal policy point.

I disagree.  We all talk about the fiscal cliff and the you made the message yourself, Mr. you said.  I would include it. MR. FISHER.  Obviously, uncertainties that derive from it.  It's a reality, and Chairman, as

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any others?

for the next 20 years. MR. FISHER.  By the way, it may be in there think we'll take that out and keep the language there-'Furthermore, strains I think what we had in mind there others who have views on that? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  Well, I think a number of voters here expressed concerns, and so I in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks'- exactly identical to last time.  Then there were two comments about the 'closely monitor' sentence.  President Kocherlakota suggested removing the words 'and financial.' was European developments, et cetera.  Are there

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  It's certainly up to the voters to decide on this.

I'll ask participants.  How many would like to keep we'll keep the language as it is.  The other suggestion was to change a little concerned about dialing back.  I think there were enough people around I'd like to keep the forward-leaning aspect, if that's okay.  All right; I think that covers get rid of the red 'issues relating to U.S. fiscal and, second, to get rid of 'mid-2015'; otherwise, alternative B would be as written. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.

We went entirely through the coffee break.  Let me propose the following.  Why don't there's coffee; lunch is also available.  So please recommence.  You can even have the consensus forecast.  Okay?  12:45. Thank you.

[Lunch break]

we recommence.  We have one last item two go-rounds.  The first one, which I hope will be very quick, is the following. and I had a press conference in half an hour, I would be showing the baseline this forecast is the basis of that a majority of the Committee supports described in this forecast-and that several grounds.  Or a similar type of statement a live exercise, would you accept the proposition your views can be, broadly speaking, described by the consensus forecast?  If not, please say words about why not.'  In the second go-round, which is more substantive, I'll let then your views and your input on this whole process-if you'd like to continue this you would like to make, et cetera.  Let me begin with the first goCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. 7   Okay.  Why don't on the agenda, item 5, which is a discussion of the experimental consensus forecast.  What we'd like to do is have If this were live consensus forecast, the one that has no policy change, and saying that the policy decision we made today.  Then I would say this forecast-or says that their own views can be people disagreed with the forecast on the following might be in the minutes.  So what we'd like to do in the first go-round-again, I think it should be very quick-is just ask people, 'If this were that a few Governor Yellen, who's the head of the communications subcommittee, start it off, and we'd like to get experiment, what changes

First goround:  Would your views be describable by the baseline consensus answer is, pretty much.  My forecast, as I said yesterday, for I'd write down something more like end of 2013 or about the forecast qua numbers, as opposed to a write-up MR. LACKER.  The inflation is closer to 2 percent, and for liftoff maybe early 2014.  Now, you're asking or any descriptive prose in the forecast?

about the numbers in table 1 that I'd be Tealbook, obviously. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I'm talking showing-excluding the

my comments about prose for later. Right now, we're just talking about the numbers in course.  And we also have exhibit 1, which shows MR. LACKER.  Okay.  All right.  Then I'll save CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. table 1-excluding the Tealbook numbers, of the fan charts.

answer.  I'm sticking to it. MR. LACKER.  Okay.  That's my

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.

I'll be able to your admonition to be brief. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I don't know if obey

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, okay.

Actually, I have three differences with the forecast, but qualitatively quite different in importance.  The first two differences are due to a different MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. they're

July 31-August 1, 2012

you do, assessment of the current state of the economy.  I think there's less slack than most of and that leads me to favor less accommodation.

Is slack on the table here? MR. LACKER.

LACKER. I thought we were talking about table 1.

MR. EVANS.  It wasn't in the table.

MR.

Lacker, I believe the table has in it a forecast for the I'm trying to explain why my forecast of the federal funds rate would differ MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  President federal funds rate. from that in this table.

MR. LACKER.  Oh, okay.  All right.

I don't view these differences in terms of policy as being that given point in time, we're going to have heterogeneous views of the size of the consensus forecast is to aggregate as best as possible our heterogeneous forecast does that in a fair and reasonable way.  But Basically, my is much more important than what the Committee thinks is it's a way for communicating what the Committee is trying to make happen. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. critical.  At any gap.  The point of a views.  And I think the current consensus my last concern of the three is that the consensus forecast appears to imply that the Committee's objective function over inflation and unemployment is inconsistent with the Committee's January statement of principles, and this is a much more significant issue for me. point is that the consensus forecast going to happen; And I think this forecast, as written, is not consistent with our longer-term strategies.

own forecast, as I've said before, I think the output gap is less negative Essentially, I look at measures of utilization-at capacity utilization, on pages 10 to 11 of the Tealbook A-and I everything, though, indicates that slack is roughly equivalent to early 2004.  Here, I In terms of my than is implied by this. average weekly hours, the box on labor shortages would say

July 31-August 1, 2012

slightly with Governor Powell that it matters whether the output gap is minus you go back to late 2004, the FOMC estimated the output running lower than it is right now, and the certainly had less accommodation in place.  So my view is I expect inflation to be rising more rapidly than is in this consensus forecast.  I think it'll be as a result.  But the name of this forecast is 'consensus,' not 'unanimous.' I would be comfortable with table 1 being used as a guess I disagree 4 percent or minus 2 percent.  And if gap to be minus 1.4 percent, inflation was actually FOMC was raising rates.  And they that rising to over 2½ percent by mid-decade, and I favor less accommodative policy than is described in table 1 If these were the only differences, description of the consensus forecast of the Committee in a press conference, Mr. Chairman.

see my final difference as being considerably more material.  I think that changing the proposed path of monetary policy, we can affect the are actually saying something about what we're trying to achieve for those doing that, it's signaling how we're applying policy to trade off I highlighted earlier, the consensus forecast says that I believe, that the Committee should be providing more to generate inflation above 2 percent.  And this matters because, Mr. I said, I think the benefit of a consensus forecast is that it tells people what we're However, I most of us would agree that by inflation rate and unemployment rate in 2014.  So the forecasts for 2014 inflation and 2014 unemployment variables in 2014.  And by unemployment versus inflation in response to future shocks.  The Committee voted in January to follow a balanced approach to the dual mandate.  The consensus forecast in table 1 seems inconsistent with a balanced approach.  As inflation will be 1.8 percent in 2014 and unemployment will be 7.6 percent.  A balanced approach would indicate, accommodation in order Chairman, as trying to achieve, and that, I think, feeds into Governor Raskin's perspective that it's important

July 31-August 1, 2012

we're trying to achieve with our policy in order for the policy to have as as possible.  Thank you. for people to know what much effectiveness

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.

the consensus forecast of your punches you don't think is going to happen. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I have a question.  Are we supposed to write down what we think is the consensus forecast or what we want to happen?  This is what we think is going to happen, not what we want to happen.  And you can't pull and write down a different forecast that

I'm okay with that.  I just thought you were saying that what we wanted to achieve, as opposed to what we thought we might achieve. conflict between what we want to achieve and what we think achieve.  This might be one of those times because the efficacy of some of the tools isn't as we would like them to be.  I guess I have a question on this consensus forecast. didn't agree with it? VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. we write down There may be times when there's a we can as great Could people accept this forecast as representing the consensus, even if they

asked is, does it represent your view? Fair enough. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The question being VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Okay.

we're going to figure out if it's a CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  And that's the way consensus.

I agree with this.  This is close enough for government VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. work.

I had a real situation, I would endorse it. MR. LOCKHART.  Yes.  This forecast lines up very closely with the forecast coming into the meeting, and so if it were

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you.  President Evans.

yes, but let me be careful.  The iterative monetary policy.  I got a forecast.  Then the first iteration came back, and it's got a funds rate am fine with that.  But if we start opening it up to everybody's appropriate MR. EVANS.  Thank you.  I think my answer is process was, submit a forecast, and I'm on my own, so I put in appropriate also took the cues that President Kocherlakota mentioned last time, and I put in quite a lot of accommodation.  So I path that has less accommodation.  If that's fixed, if my forecast is conditional on that, I'm in the consensus and I policies- you thought that this wasn't accommodative enough, and then you could say, 'Well, CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I think you could dissent on the action, for example, because

July 31-August 1, 2012

Committee has decided to do, I think this is an appropriate forecast.' conditional on what the Does that sound right?

This is the outcome you'll get if the Committee does VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. what the Committee planned to do.

will happen if the Committee doesCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Right.  This is what MR. EVANS.  I'm sorry.  Could you just go through that one more time?  I'm a little slow on that.

Hypothetically, let's assume that you're very unhappy with CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. the policy path that is in this baseline forecast.

MR. EVANS.  Right.

you dissented in CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  And so you could imagine, let's say, that the meeting on the policy action.

MR. EVANS.  Yes.

care for this policy path. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You still might say, 'Well, I don't But given this policy path, I'm okay with this forecast.'

I agree completely with that characterization. MR. EVANS.  Yes.

Do you agree with that, Governor Yellen? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.

with that, except you have people who have actually voted in who are very strongly inclined toward action in the very near future, like at this forecast, I'm with President Evans.  As far as the economics go, I'm fine calls into question the appropriateness of the policy.  And so I guess I'll guess I'm taking my turn-that I have significant reservations.  I would think you discuss this MS. YELLEN.  I agree favor of no action today me.  I'm looking with it, but it really say-sorry, I would want to be able to walk into a press conference and be able to say-when you

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes, that's the idea.  President Rosengren.

I would be in the consensus. MR. ROSENGREN.  I would prefer the Tealbook, but it's close enough to the consensus that

MR. WILLIAMS.  Yes.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Pianalto.

MS. PIANALTO.  The forecast broadly matches CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.

Like President Kocherlakota, my view is that while the top-line from what I would predict, my policy path would be forecast.  On those grounds, effects are going to be, and that calls into question, as in President Williams's case, much forecasts.  But I'd likely be on the other side; adopting the policy in the forecast would be quite different.  So I'm not quite sure whether we're reaching a whether that's agreeing with the consensus. MR. PLOSSER. numbers are not that much different different, and in fact under this policy path, I would have a different what matters a lot for this is how one interprets both the shocks hitting the economy and what their different policy consensus, my consensus or you'd be outside the consensus because CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think that means you think that this policy will not deliver those numbers.

great, and when I see PCE prices of tenths of 2 percent and these kinds of confidence bands, I just can't see that as good.  I do think the the central tendency.  That's really the key with the private sector, which is just assuming ½ percent a year or something got it down at a lower level.  And of course, that pessimism is informing I'd say is that if charts, maybe this would be a good time to take out core PCE prices.  You've good time to put the fed funds chart here instead and have PCE prices and the MR. BULLARD.  I think these confidence bands are within a couple being very different from hitting the target.  So this is generally very unemployment rate seems to run high compared with difference between the Committee and what the private sector seems to say:  The Committee is more pessimistic about unemployment rate adjustment quite a ways out, out until the end of 2014, as compared like that, and so they've a lot of judgments here about what the policy should be.  The only other thing you look at these got headline here, and, of course, we're looking over the medium term, which this chart already does.  Maybe it's a fed funds rate.

Useful, interesting suggestion.  President Fisher. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.

don't have a problem with the economic variables, and I think the fan path, and much like President George, I I looked at my colleague was that I going to suggest the same thing about core PCE-not to replace it with a funds rate path, but MR. FISHER.  I charts are fine.  I do have questions about the policy would have some reservations on that front.  And the reason was

July 31-August 1, 2012

it because I thought we were going to get away from core PCE and I would suggest removing focus on PCE overall.  That would be the only difference, depending on how the group feels.

In addition, circulation of these inputs in advance of the meeting may enhance our deliberations in September.  However, on the or not the input should be circulated with attribution, I have no strong views.  Of course, if the

and reactions.  We'll start CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Let's get some comments with President Williams.

I material distributed to be very useful and informative, but I noted in our June meeting, I remain very concerned about imposing a sizable additional MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman and the staff, for all of the hard work they put into producing the consensus forecast.  I think it's been a very interesting exercise. particularly found the two tables in the as

July 31-August 1, 2012

all know, the Board staff a very full plate and preparing a mini-forecast between meetings, if that was additional burden on the staff, and I wholeheartedly agree.  As our discussions still face enormous economic challenges and heightened events both here and abroad, and the staff should be focused on those for the possibility of further negative shocks to the you're thinking about it-that there may a simpler way of putting together a coherent consensus forecast with relatively little cost.  For with the median SEP think is how you started with this one.  And can just adjust the median projection, tweak that as needed to make sure coherent consensus forecast consistent with the Committee's policy direction. FOMC meeting based on the policy decision and discussions there.  So my next meeting is, as I described, to try to refine the existing SEP process, burden on the staff unless the benefit is equally sizable.  And as we already has necessary for this, adds to that load.  The Chairman said at our last meeting that it was important not to place a net over the last two days show, we uncertainty about future issues as well as contingency planning economy.  I think-and I'm not sure if this is the way be example, table 1 in the consensus forecast could be produced by starting projection from the Committee members, which I then, Mr. Chairman, you it represents a Draft consensus table 1 could be circulated on Friday or Monday before the FOMC meeting, and I think that would not have a large cost on the staff.  Of course, the consensus forecast would be updated at the recommendation for the which we'll be doing, rather than trying to proceed with a second consensus forecast exercise like the first.

that showed how the forecast would change assumptions.  This is one of the most useful things I've gotten the policies in alternatives A, B, and C.  I think that such a table As a final note, I very much like table 2 under alternative monetary policy in terms of thinking about should be regularly included in the Tealbook B-so much for my not throwing additional work

It lets us all think about what are choices that we're confronting, given the staff forecast, in thinking about policy liftoff dates or the need for different asset purchases. alternative forecasts for different alternative policies. like to see that become a regular part of the Tealbook thing I'd like to mention-and Governor Yellen mentioned this, too-is that we rule that's behind the scenes not only in the a lot of our thinking about the these consensus forecasts.  And as Governor the outcome-based rule may not be the best choice for that, and I think we may want to think about giving the staff direction concerning a preferred policy about policy.  But right now, I think that's been a default setting that what we're doing.  Thanks. A related do need to think a little bit more about this policy Tealbook-which I and, I'm sure, many people use as a basis of economic outlook-but also in terms of preparing Yellen mentioned before, definitely rule.  It's important to have a policy rule in these simulations in the Tealbook; that's just an essential part of thinking perhaps isn't the best for

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Accepted.

I'll now go on to deliver a lengthy statement.  I'm assuming that-but me-the intention is that this would supplant the SEP mechanism.  Is MR. LACKER. this is a little murky for that correct?

I guess that would be my preference, but it's not preCHAIRMAN BERNANKE. programmed.  The Committee will decide that.

LACKER.  Okay.  The following remarks are predicated on that.  I think that the forecast information from each participant.  I would be were to from asking for the range of information we get in the SEP.  I think that under our good deal of effort goes into participants' SEP submissions.  What I have is avoiding the dangers of herd behavior or free riding on the forecast.  I think that you get the Tealbook, before you've seen everything, group opinion mechanisms are you're listening to independent views.  So I'd suggest that we could build this MR. SEP is a much more detailed request for afraid that we would lose something in Committee deliberations in terms of quality if we back away current procedures, a in mind here bringing independent views to bear before is valuable.  The literature on the wisdom of crowds suggests that more valuable if around just an adaptation of the SEP-have that level of submission occur and then work from that material to develop a consensus forecast.

I think it would be useful and consistent with our traditional philosophy way to retain the presentation of something like the range and central views.  We have these prototype fan charts, and there are these two I understand the value of forming a away information.   I think we would also invite the Related to this, of transparency to find a tendency of participants' blue dots for the last meeting's range.  It would be pretty straightforward to add something to represent the current cycle's central tendency or range. consensus forecast, but we're throwing

July 31-August 1, 2012

that we're moving to a consensus forecast as a way to suppress the in the SEP and the forward guidance in the cynical interpretation apparent discrepancy between the dot picture statement.

applaud the use of confidence bands.  My staff says you call them fan charts only if had this discussion yesterday.  But I'm indifferent as to whether we call But as I understand it, the fan charts as calculated about our policy reaction function, and I think to at conveying uncertainty, we ought to strive to be as comprehensive as possible in the uncertainty we have over the forecast.  In addition, I strongly policy instrument in a way that's as parallel as core inflation rate on that first going to do four charts, or even making room for it, if we want to retain core, good idea-and to show it with fan charts, to show uncertainty, because it's spurious as though it's a single path and yet there are error bands around everything else I believe this is not that difficult; the staff does it, for example, in the Tealbook all I they're multicolored; we them fan charts or not-that's okay with me. don't capture model uncertainty or uncertainty be faithful gathering and portraying believe we should treat the forecast of our possible to our presentation of things like the GDP and inflation forecasts.  I think President Bullard's suggestion of putting the fed funds rate in place of the page, if we're would be a precision to act we do.  And the time.

bit of a tangle at the beginning of the last goyou take the word another-like, conditioned on GDP, my forecast for can see that it makes more sense to just think of them all as Further, we are forecasting both the economy and our policy-setting.  Now, that allows More broadly, I think we need to design this process in a way that handles our policy views in a coherent, clear manner.  We had a little round about, well, conditioned on this policy and conditioned on that.  If 'policy' out and substitute one variable for inflation would be different-you parallel.

July 31-August 1, 2012

And it doesn't rule out commitment or some maneuvers to push down the yield we've tried.  I think I'll say this as well-if we present a policy forecast as part of our for moving away from the And I'll just remind you all that we discussed in January when I first advocated this.  In January, I proposed dropping the forward guidance I was told was that people objected a Committee consensus.  Well, now we're going to consensus.  So I wouldn't see the rationale for retaining the forward guidance in the superfluous and it doesn't matter whether it's regards, so using this vehicle strikes me as an And let me endorse strongly President Williams's suggestion that we ask the staff for assumptions.  I've commented on this all sorts of crazy real-world shocks, but they don't do we're trying to decide on, and I think that's kind of a shame.  I'd be for commitment. curve as consensus, which I think we should, this would be an ideal vehicle calendar-based forward guidance in the statement. this in favor of the presentation that was in the SEP, and what because the statement language represents have a statement-although you could argue that it's just there or not.  But it's proven problematic in some advantage. alternative forecasts under different monetary policy before-that they do alternatives for alternatives for the stuff happy if they cut down on crazy scenarios, too, so that we avoid overburdening the staff.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I don't want to get off track, but on this issue of errors? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. constructing the fan charts, you use historical forecast errors, right?  Simulated forecast simulations.  The way to think about it rule-that's critical.  And then you're just having the funds rate respond, MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Well, they're stochastic is, you have to choose a as the rule would dictate.

not? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, I understand, but the stochastic simulation is drawing from a distribution of historical forecast errors or

July 31-August 1, 2012

It's drawing from a distribution not of forecast errors but of responses youMR. REIFSCHNEIDER. historical shocks to the economy, and it's stochastic, so it's running through dynamic to the sorts of shocks we've seen historically.  Under current circumstances, that gives because of zero bound, for example-a very skewed distribution.

Okay.  President Kocherlakota. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.

apology.  I'll be brief.  As Presidents Williams and Lacker did, I found table 2 to be include some table like that I guess, are related to the alternatives A, B, and C that we're I also like President Williams's idea of allowing the Chairman to create the first good idea. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you, President Lacker, for your extremely useful, and it would be great to have future Tealbook Bs where the various policies, contemplating. draft, at least, of the consensus forecast based on the SEP submissions, and then tweaking that.  I thought that was a very solve with the experiment.  The consensus example, alternative B the date in the statement to mid-2015.  In alternative C, or elements of I guess.  Once the Committee makes a decision, the forecast is going to I think the forecast should be based on the outcome of the vote in the after the vote, and the press after the release of the statement.  The forecast I think there's a timing issue we have to forecast is going to be prepared before the meeting.  Then today, for allowed the Committee the opportunity to change principle, the Committee could have chosen to adopt alternative A, all three alternatives, have to be updated in some fashion.  So this could create a little bit of a logistical problem, and here are the issues. meeting.  Participants should have some opportunity to comment on the forecast before it's released to the public.  The statement should be released shortly conference should take place relatively shortly should be made available to the public at the time of the press conference, and the press

July 31-August 1, 2012

are the constraints.  I think there's a timing box here.  I think we have to build in some I'm not sure where.  I would suggest delaying the press conference everything done.  I'm certainly not trying the right answer is.  The issue is that we're going to have a vote in the going to have to be tweaked based on that.  I think people are going to want rest of that I'm not conference should take place at least 24 hours before the end of the blackout period.  [Laughter] So these extra delay somewhere, but by 24 hours.  Maybe that would be enough time to get to take a stand on what meeting-the policy decision is, obviously, not determined before we have the meeting-and then the forecast is to have a chance to comment on that as well, and then how we resolve the sure.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Tarullo.

you, Mr. Chairman.  I don't have specific ideas as to how this I do have a few higher-level observations.  One, I do think the process the scofflaws-apparently only two-who so I endorse Janet's view that there should be a collective judgment by the Committee or, more than a bit concerned that if we end up with both an SEP and the collective forecast, going to be sowing more confusion rather than less confusion.  Then taking account of of individuals are not I think going to need a process, Janet, by which people get to express-initially at least-their associated with those views, but the process then MR. TARULLO.  Thank should be resolved, but needs to be somewhat iterative.  And I was one of didn't inject themselves into this process this time something compulsory about participation beforehand.  My second point is that this really does have to be a consensus in the sense of reflecting perhaps more accurately, the Chairman helping to forge a collective judgment by the Committee. I'm we're Jeff's desire to have some more transparency and make sure that the views completely lost here, I think that Narayana's timing issue comes back to the fore, because you're own views.  Maybe there's some transparency

July 31-August 1, 2012

end, there's a collective judgment as developed and articulated by the at the press conference.  And with that, at least, an SEP but an SEP-like I feel strongly.  Everything else I'm happy to defer to the judgment of intervenes so that at the Chairman both in quantitative terms and verbally I think the world, at least the informed and thoughtful world, will be able to reconcile whatever these two different pieces of information are-whether it's, I hope not polling function beforehand and the eventual outcome-because there will have been this lapse of time during which everybody understands that iteration will have taken place.  Those are the only two things on which you and your subcommittee.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lockhart.

I answer Janet's questions, I'd just go over a few points.  Some of these are fairly basic, but they helped me at least to elucidate the rationale for a agree that the consensus forecast idea conveys more information than the same time.  The clarified in my mind what you, as the Chairman, have in mind, and an ex post consensus forecast on what the recent decision is expected to yesterday's meeting that I think is simpler and easier.  It's not greater relief what I think is an issue, and that is, what's the I thought this was going to operate-that is, we might use the reference, and we would submit forecasts similar to an SEP, premised on the MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Before like to clarify my thinking.  First, I understand that the purpose is decision that was just made by the Committee and would be explained, for example, in your press conference.  And I the central tendencies in the SEPs that would be otherwise published about short discussion yesterday that is, you have accomplish, as opposed to an ex ante outlook to which the policy decision reacted.  And I had something in mind coming into perfect at all, but it does bring into policy assumption on which we're all premising the exercise?  So for the good of the order, let me just walk you through how Tealbook for

July 31-August 1, 2012

consensus proposal.  Everyone would react to that and, at that stage or a later stage, either endorse it or not.  The final consensus forecast that preceded the confusing to the public-that this is not a post-decision forecast.  This is recommendation at the meeting.  I do think this assumption is very important, and I think it was already reflected in the existing policy stance, the one that had been decided at the last meeting.  The Chairman would then work with this input to craft a conceivably would be completed, with exhibits and so forth.  That would be a forecast FOMC meeting and serves as a basis for understanding the decision that the Committee arrived at.  And then, when you would explain it, you would have to emphasize-and this is not easy, because it could be very a decision on which people formed their policy question of the policy brief discussion we had earlier.

general approach used in the exercise would assumption complication.  There are assumptions at work, and therefore it's not apples to apples in terms of the input. mind, if we could to run through a pre-meeting endorsement or and see if some of the mechanical questions that President Kocherlakota going to work in real time.  I do have a little bit of a problem with the I'd suggest we use subjective probabilities provided by each participant, Now, to the questions.  First, do I think the be helpful?  Yes, if we don't get bogged down in this policy various policy What elements would I suggest be modified in future experiments?  In my agree on the mechanics, we could go to a true trial run next time around, meaning that we would have some kind of explicit policy assumption on which we based our inputs; inputs would be mandatory.  We would submit on exact dates, try feedback on exact dates, raised are actually confidence interval exhibits.  I don't really find the confidence intervals from model-based simulations very informative.  I'm not sure the public is going to find them very informative.  As an alternative, something similar to the approach that's used in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's survey

July 31-August 1, 2012

the general public as so wide as to be inclusive of practically every outcome.  So I'd of primary dealers and other surveys.  And then from subjective probability distributions, one could derive the Committee's sense of the risks for each economic variable.  At 70 percent or 90 percent in some of the economic indicators, the spread in the confidence intervals would be viewed by like us to think about some other approach, if that's possible.

to the question 'If the Committee with a second experiment, to what extent should participants . . . provide input to the his initial preparation of the consensus forecast?'  I very much think input circulated or circulated with I definitely support a second experiment.  In response proceeds Chairman in advance of that's what we should do.  If it's based on something similar to the SEP submissions, that's fine. And then I would certainly not object to having my attribution-no objection there.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  I think central banks use both approaches, right?

The Bank of EnglandMR. KAMIN.

-uses an ex ante type of approach-right?-because it CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. uses the market path.  Is that right?

MR. KAMIN.  On the policy path, yes, the Bank of England uses both a flat path and something that comes out of markets.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Vice Chairman.

I'm going to propose a second experiment that's a what we did as the first experiment.  The experiment I'd like to run is a VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think this is a useful exercise, and so, in response to the questions, I think we should keep going.  But little bit different than little bit more elaborate and somewhat more decentralized, and it would go like this.  People

July 31-August 1, 2012

alternative A, alternative B, and alternative C, and presumably those monetary policy Committee participants.  The Chairman would consensus forecast from all of those submissions for each of the three monetary get to see how the consensus forecast was sensitive to the monetary favored-which was the consensus of the consensus, so clarity about the source of agreement and disagreement within the Let me give you an example so I can explain what I mean by this.  Let's imagine accommodation.  This greater stimulus was not greater stimulus was not warranted because one thought that policy only very small gains.  You just thought that the cost-benefit of additional stimulus was poor.  For example, you might think that a large-scale wouldn't do very much.  It wouldn't be that you disagreed about the you disagreed that the policy tool would actually drive significant improvement.  Or the consensus for the first two, but you might not prefer greater you had a different reaction function and you weighted the inflation and the differently.  Right now, I think it's very difficult for us to tease those you started with three different monetary policy assumptions, got people would submit their forecasts, or they would default to some preliminary Tealbook forecast, made under three different monetary policy assumptions specified by the Chairman.  You could think of that as assumptions would span the range of views of the then prepare a policy paths.  You'd actually policy assumptions of the Committee.  And then participants at the end would be quizzed about which of these things that they actually to speak.  I think this approach would actually work better than what we have right now, because it would provide greater Committee. that we're in a circumstance today that one does not favor more policy could be the case for several distinct reasons.  One might decide that warranted because one had a more optimistic growth forecast-that's a difference in forecast. Or one might decide that stimulus would generate calculation asset purchase program forecast, but you might be in line with stimulus because unemployment objectives three things out.  And if

July 31-August 1, 2012

those monetary policy assumptions, and saw where people a good deal of where people agree and disagree I think this would be a little bit more interactive and  would allow us to as a second type of experiment. to submit their forecasts relative to landed, you actually would be able to tease out within the Committee. really play on what's driving the differences-is it the policy assumptions, is it the forecasts, or is it the reaction function?  And so I would propose this

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Evans.

useful The issues that Governor Yellen raised in terms of participants providing input and inputs-those things would be very helpful and we should continue to make progress was listening to Dennis very carefully, and I thought I was in complete agreement and then I wasn't quite sure. all very interesting ideas, and if we have a lot of time to work quite useful.  [Laughter] MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Well, I thought this was a very exercise. circulating on them.  I with him right up until he got to that subjective probability stuff, But then again, I was with Vice Chairman Dudley, too, until he started with three different assumptions.  I think those are through them, they'll be

I say, I like the initial exercise; as a communication device for the Committee, it was I might not agree with it, least, you tell me this is the assumption, and then I'll tell you what my inflation outlook is Lacker will approach it the same way, right?  And that'll provide a lot of might be if you identify who the some idea of the kind of model of the economy that person is working As useful.  It focused on our areas of agreement, which I thought was very useful.  A lot of times, with the SEPs, for some reason our eyes are drawn to the outliers and the ranges.  I thought that the common monetary policy assumption was really critical, because but at going to be.  President the information that's relevant for this.  Another alternative participant is and I have their way through, there'll be more information, but probably not a tremendous amount.  At any

July 31-August 1, 2012

I think what's really important here is whatever helps you in a collection of forecasts that don't speak well among themselves because we you have looked at very your discussions, and it would be useful you provided some preferences on that.  But I think that it will be useful to continue to make rate, it could be useful.  Frankly, your press conference discuss the outlook in a coherent fashion.  You always do it coherently, but you're provided have different policy assumptions.  I would think that something that carefully, and in some sense own, would help facilitate if progress.  Thank you.

I must have misspoken.  Conditioning on whatever the assumption is that we're given. MR. EVANS.  I'm sorry. common monetary policy a reaction function? MR. LACKER.  What do you mean by that?  Do you mean a single point path for the funds rate or

I'm sorry.  I can't recall exactly where in my comments you're taking this MR. EVANS. from.

I don't think anywhere now we're asked to provide a forecast policy. MR. LACKER.  Because conditional on a path for

MR. EVANS.  No, we're not.  We're asked to do appropriate monetary policy, right? MR. LACKER.  Right.  Oh, okay.

No, that's our current assumption under SEPs, going all the way back to subcommittee came up with it. MR. EVANS. when Don Kohn's

July 31-August 1, 2012

you were referring to?  Is that what you meantMR. LACKER.  So is that what 'conditioning on appropriate policy'?

Well, no.  I thought what was useful here was that-and this is my a policy path-a funds rate path-and if we all come up with our assumption, then I know how to interpret what those forecasts I might have a lower inflation forecastBut the policy path is common across that.  I think that would be whoever else is looking at this forecast. MR. EVANS. interpretation-if there's forecast based on that policy mean.  So you might have a high inflation forecast; something like that. informative for the Chairman and

MR. LACKER.  But that's asking us to forecast what the economy would have to do to make us want to choose that funds rate path.

and how the would respond. MR. EVANS.  This is an assumption about an exogenous policy variable forecast

MR. LACKER.  Well, that's a different question.

I would interpret our instruction. MR. EVANS.  Well, that's how you were suggesting, Vice Chairman? different CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That was what VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Well, the point is, in my version, you get three monetary policy paths that span the Committee's preferences.  And so you get forecasts that are somehow consistent across the possible outcomes.

it's not truly endogenous.  What you assume, is some kind of reaction function that you'd stick into your generate the path of output and inflation. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The problem is that really want, in principle, I model.  And then you'd jointly

July 31-August 1, 2012

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  President Rosengren.

go-round.  I don't think we want to get 'dissent of policy.  I actually come a little to where Dennis was-that it would assumption.  I think it's quite reasonable to use the previous Tealbook as a starting-off point for that common the economic outcomes are different. Given the fan chartsLacker would like to widen the fan charts even more than they already are, adding going to be fairly hard to dissent against the forecast you want to use a two-standard-error definition.  I think broadly, most people going to be agreeing with that forecast based on that policy path.  So I would be comfortable MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you.  Like many, I was troubled by coming up with a consensus forecast where policy assumptions were widely divergent.  We already have an opportunity to dissent on policy with the policy squared' on a difference be more useful to start with a common policy whatever the path was in assumption, and then ask whether and President some additional uncertainties-it actually is that comes out if are with roughly where Dennis was.

about what the alternative is and what problem we're trying to solve.  I agree with of the problem was that with the previous SEP we were focused on all of the variables are disclosed and identified.  It forecasts, and presumably each As we think about whether we should go forward with the consensus forecast, we should at least think President Evans that part outliers rather than commonality, and that was particularly true because there wasn't a distinction between participants and voters.  An alternative-or it seems like the most viable alternativewould be that the participants' forecasts for has the attribute that it makes participants accountable for their

July 31-August 1, 2012

consistent.  One of the problems with the process that we have now is kind of model, and that inconsistency bothers me a little bit.  We it clear that the consensus forecast gets us to a much better place than a It may be that we focuses us on agreement rather than I do think that if we proceed, all guess is that we where people's views are, by and large; if I'm comfortable disclosing to comfortable disclosing to my peers.  I think that it's not a bad if we just shared all of our own input.  Thank you. forecast will be internally that as we go from the initial round to the next round, we're changing variables that may or may not be consistent with any should ask ourselves, is full-disclosure alternative, where all of the information would be available? think it does get us to a better place, because it clearly disagreements, and that's true for how people would report it.  But we should at least think about what the viable alternative is that we're considering. participants should provide input-so it should be mandatory-and that the compilation that the participants provide in the initial round should be circulated to everybody.  My could pretty much guess the public, I should obviously be thing

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Pianalto.

general approach used consensus forecast that could improve our communications.  But I think that we will need to address a few questions about our consensus forecast.  These questions occurred to me as I reflected on this first be using slightly first question is, can we achieve a consensus is coherent in its relationships among economic growth, inflation, and a consistent model of the economy?  President Rosengren was MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Overall, I think the in this initial exercise could form the basis for an approach that, with some enhancements and a lot of practice, could produce a to increase the odds of success, ability to form a experiment.  These issues have already been raised by others, and I just may different wording in order to address them.  The forecast that unemployment without employing

July 31-August 1, 2012

rely mostly on judgment to form a consensus, do we risk economic growth, I am inclined to think that we need some kind of consensus model a consensus forecast so that we can tell a consistent story over time.  Without a forecasts that we publish might harm our communications confidence interval?  Under that approach, as others have pointed out, because the rare.  For a consensus the is appropriate monetary policy?  Several people indicated today that they agreed with the policy path.  So should one dissent on just commenting on that.  If we producing a forecast that is sometimes inconsistent in its relationships among inflation, and unemployment? to be able to have consistent story, the sequence of rather than help them.  The second question is, what should the standard be for whether we think our individual forecasts are sufficiently different from the consensus to warrant dissenting? Should we consider a difference in forecast meaningful when it is large enough relative to the particular confidence intervals are so wide, meaningful differences would be very forecast to improve our communications, I think we do need to reach agreement on what would warrant a dissent from the consensus forecast.  The third question to answer concerns communication surrounding the consensus forecast:  How should we treat the differences in our views of what with the consensus forecast, but they didn't agree the consensus forecast based on a disagreement on appropriate monetary policy?

some consensus forecast, I think it would be drafting stage. that the Chairman circulate the preliminary Board staff forecast, that all of then submit forecasts back to the Chairman, and that the Chairman then I am personally we provide the individual forecasts with attribution; I could go either way.  I am In concluding, I do support going forward with the experiment, and I have suggestions for our next experiment.  For achieving a helpful to share more of the inputs among all of the participants during the Specifically, I propose the FOMC participants share those projections with the participants, along with the draft consensus. open to whether

July 31-August 1, 2012

I don't think that is necessary.  Thank you, Mr. happy to go ahead and include attribution, but Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard.

you, Mr. Chairman.  I have just a few comments.  I'm a big has been carried out very well.  So do I keep an eye on the final product, which would report and the kinds of things that would go in there.  I think there would here in the final product, the final monetary policy report. MR. BULLARD.  Thank supporter of this exercise, and I think this initial round think we should do more?  Yes, I do.  We have to be a monetary policy be a lot more information, at least in my mind, that would flesh out, maybe, some of the issues that are being discussed assumption conundrum, and I have a the market assumption at the time the forecast is made.  This is, as I Bank of England does.  This would give the forecast more of a flavor of, going to do, here's what we think is going to happen.' a date on that and say that we took the market expectation as of such and you decided something different at the you've got to iterate around to get the right forecast.  Now, this is a brilliant from where the Committee expects to go, and if they are a lot different, why we have a 90-degree angle between them back into line with what's likely to happen.  The other thing that's A lot of people are talking about the policy suggestion for this.  I think it would be much simpler and cut through a lot of confusion if we just based the forecast on understand it, what the 'Given what the market thinks that we're And you could even put such a date.  Then you don't get into the position that meeting, and now thing that the Bank of England did, because market expectations in most circumstances are not going to be too different we should be asking ourselves a lot of questions about our views and the market's views.  Most of the time, that's going to work very well, and I would say if those expectations are a lot out of line, then it's up to the Chairman and other Committee members to try to nudge

July 31-August 1, 2012

and say, 'Look, we changed our mind, and we're going to do X or we're going to do I wouldn't expect that to happen a lot, but it does give the Committee that freedom to act. you might think of an intermeeting action, which has sometimes occurred in the policy is that you can take all aspects of IOER rate to the balance sheet to funds rate those things together. brilliant about it is that it does put out a realistic forecast, but it allows the Committee to come back later Y.' For example, last five years; something comes up, and you really have to move in a different direction.  The other thing about taking the market expectation of policy.  It could be everything from reducing the dates and all comment is on these confidence intervals.  They are model based.  I think I'm not sure know if those bands are actually bigger or that model and everybody a particularly good model.  Thank you. My only other they're fine, but as the Chairman was talking about, you could use historical forecast errors from the Greenbook and Tealbook, and maybe that would be a way to capture the full extent of the uncertainty that we've experienced since we've been keeping track of those errors; quite how long that has been, but it goes a ways back.  In my mind, that is a more all-encompassing measure of uncertainty.  I don't smaller, but those would be interesting.  And that would be one way to keep it a little bit model free, because otherwise you're saying that everyone is committed to thinks that that model is

at least nominally have a single target.  So you can look at the forecast and see whether expectations.  With two objectives, unless you give them the CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  One difference between the Bank of England and the Fed is that they it hits the inflation target or not, and that's a way of signaling to the market whether they should be tightening or loosening their reaction function, it's a little more subtle.

I think it would be to see how this plays out with respect to the input and how it Dudley mentioned, that I would like to see-more MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I think I some of our well-tested communications, such as the minutes and the statement we use, I was more willing to push more on the SEP to see whether we diversity of views.  But I highlighting who the Committee members, as a way to leverage that diversity of views. said that, worthwhile to have some more reps gets to something, which Vice Chairman focus on where we differ on policy paths and what the assumptions are.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Plosser.

fascinating discussion, I end, in part because I wanted to hear what people with probably more questions than answers, and I'm open to lots which I think had John Williams's suggestion about simplifying and using the SEP to leverage up I am inclined to believe the SEP is still a powerful use communication device and a transparency device.  I tend not to be in favor we envision doing this every MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  This has been a have to confess, and I wanted to go near the were thinking.  I've come away of different ideas.  I'll just react to some things that people have said, all of merit to them. has a lot of merit to it-to reduce costs. of information and a of replacing this, which leads me to the question of whether meeting or only once a quarter.  One question that crops up in this discussion-if we're really

July 31-August 1, 2012

consensus forecast that justifies a particular meeting's decision, then you're it on an every meeting basis.  That may be more than we want to do.  If going to do that, then you need to think of other objectives you're trying to achieve of them.  One of the questions that come to goes back to the governance issue:  However we manage this process, we want to be that we not have a pre-meeting meeting and in some sense decide before we actually get going to use it as a almost forced into doing you're not through this thing, and I think there are a number mind careful to our meeting.  That raises all sorts of iterative questions about how we converge on this.  I think that's going to be a challenge.

attracted to Vice Chairman Dudley's suggestion about doing I've come either way, but I'm really attracted to allowing participants to generate their could be very revealing both as well.  How we view this as going into a larger for some time in terms of a monetary policy reportOne thing that was missing from this exercise that I think is going to be whatever the going to be the nature of the discussions about the varying views that with this.  And at some point, we're going to have to figure out how to put that on paper, richness of what it is we're to achieve in this process. In many ways, I'm very some scenarios.  I think there could be a lot of value to that.  There is a subtle question about whether this is endogenous or exogenous and how we think about that.  I'm not sure down strongly forecasts based on different assumptions about policy.  That internally and, perhaps, for other purposes project, as Jim and I have been arguing again, whether this is quarterly, every meeting, or what-and how all of these pieces fit together remain to be seen. important going forward-one of the things that gives us value outside of consensus might be-is goes too, to make sure that we get the want to make one other point.  This notion of standard errors-I believe standard errors I are huge on our forecasts and everything else we do, but one of the things that we know from our

July 31-August 1, 2012

experiments is that sometimes small differences in the variables in the reaction different policy implications.  Just to say that we're all falling within the about what the policy implications to have very different policy paths, because small differences can make I think that raises a whole host of questions in my mind about a number of apply here, too. policy rule function can have very standard errors of these things is really not very helpful in that context.  That doesn't mean the standard errors aren't large, but there are subtle differences might be from smaller differences.  There's uncertainty, and then there's that small difference that may lead some of us a difference in that. things, but it does

I do believe that we're going to have to experiment some internally.  And it may out what it is we want to get out of this at the end of the day and what's I think we should proceed apace, run some experiments, be going to try some things and throw I think in some of these cases, we're not going to be solving the problem going to have to see how it works.  So I'm very encouraged.  I also find it A lot of this discussion suggests to me that we need to proceed with this because there's value to it, but take us a while to figure the best way to do it effectively. willing to try some different things and react to them.  We're them out, perhaps, but in the abstract.  We're very interesting, and I think we should continue with the experiments.

to echo what Presidents Kocherlakota and nice to be able to see that, or something like I'd like to say one other thing.  I want Williams suggested about table 2.  It would be very that, on a fairly regular basis.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher.

is that this exercise is really intended to help you clarify some I call spots and dots, which is the SEP exercise.  Having your holding press conferences, it seemed to me that the way we MR. FISHER.  My sense of the confusion that came out of what been a full-throated advocate of

July 31-August 1, 2012

exercise that good ideas around the table.  I that Vice Chairman Dudley articulated.  That would be the most useful, your job easier in terms of not only explaining the cacophony at this for pulling this exercise together-first, I appreciate your taking qualitative that back, I guess, to making the Chairman's job it could achieve that if indeed we can try to identify where the consensus is and what the while also tolerating the fact that we do have ranges of views and we do have at this table.  On the issue of identification, remember that I'm very leak I served on two ships in the Navy, so accidental leaks always concern me.  But I think about leakage in terms of one who might get more attention and distract from the point that we have achieved a articulated by you.  We all know internally who we arguing.  I'm not sure it makes sense to, or whether it's necessary, or it even us to have attribution, as I worry about accidental leaks because some did the SEP made things a little bit awkward.  And in fact, I would like to have an would simplify or help you in this process.  I've heard some very thought President Williams's ideas were thoughtful in terms of how this thing evolves.  I'd like to get to the point although it would take us time to get there, but that should be the ultimate goal of the exercise. I'm in favor of what makes table, but also pulling together the common threads.  With regard to Janet's points-and I thank you, Governor, information as well as quantitative information.  Having submitted qualitative information was quite extensive, I think that's important.  Going easier, common points are dissent that takes place conscious; if we're trying to get a consensus expressed by our leader, I worry or two people common decision and that decision is being are and where we're adds to the exercise, for get more attention than others at this table.  And that may not help you in the job.

I found Vice Chairman Dudley's comments particularly thoughtful; all of the So that's my overall opinion, Mr. Chairman, of this exercise.  I would be in favor of a second experiment.  I think we should go through this in an iterative fashion.  And again, I want to reiterate that

July 31-August 1, 2012

eventually where we could have a sense of along any one of the suggestions being put on the table.  Final comment: your job easier, not more complex, and if this serves that purpose, then I'm in Thank you, Mr. Chairman. comments were thoughtful.  I'd like to get to that goal how we might move We'd like to make favor of it.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Duke.

going to confess that I'm not finding this helpful at all.  I find it hard to expression of whether or not they agree with the you condense this into a simple message that going to communicate to the public, it's really hard for me to come down to that.  I think started with something that we all thought in common, and then tried to In terms of the policy assumption, it seems to me that it's a good If the single policy assumption is, 'If we do at the last meeting, what would you expect the forecast starting with the dowe do nothing differently, this is how we think the economy is going to what we think is the right policy. MS. DUKE.  I'm even follow all of the subtleties of everybody's consensus forecast.  When I try to think of how you're it would be helpful if we see how far apart we were. idea to start from a single policy assumption. nothing different than what we had said to be, based on incoming data?' that at least says, to me, that everybody is nothing scenario, and if evolve.  Then we use that baseline to decide of iterations, I certainly have no in it, and I I can do to get my submissions in by five o'clock you want me to make submissions a week or two earlier than that, they're going to guesses-in fact, they are going to be guesses.  So I have a little bit of a just because we needed would hate to move the thinking that goes into the Tealbook forecast Second piece, as far as the timing and the number confidence in my own forecasting ability.  I use the Tealbook, I use the information use questions to the staff.  And it's everything on Friday.  If be pretty close to problem with that.  I don't think it would be good to require me to guess it at a certain time.  And I

July 31-August 1, 2012

current information to base our decisions on. back a couple of weeks, because then it's based on less-current information, and I think it's more important that we have could agree on using a particular policy rule, at you think the outcome would be, and then you use some kind of specific be your favorite, but, in my opinion, if we can all agree on one that we ask the staff, in the Tealbook, to follow that policy rule with that, when you're at the zero lower bound, you make some adjustment, either you wait a longer time or you wait until it calls for or you wait for some conditions to be met.  But again, we specify what the staff to use in terms of how they show us the alternatives, and then I think it is you choose alternative A, you're choosing this path; if you you choose alternative C, you're choosing this you disagree that this policy option would create this much difference in terms of the can talk about that.  If you think that more LSAPs are you don't think that the actual outcome would be what it are and keep as many other pieces Finally, I think it would be helpful if we least for the Tealbook.  You take a common assumption about what policy starts out at, you use that to forecast what policy rule.  It might not could use so that we're all talking about the same thing, it keeps us from having too many moving parts.  I think we could also all of the alternative simulations, and it might be one requires 75 basis points on liftoff rule we want helpful to look at the options-if choose alternative B, you're choosing this path; if path.  If ultimate outcome on the economy, then we not going to be that effective, and so shows in there, then you can talk about that difference.  But somehow it would be more helpful to me if we could start to narrow in on where the differences of it constant as we can.  It's just hard for me to think in that many dimensions.  That's the exercise I would like to see.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Raskin.

July 31-August 1, 2012

that were put on this experiment was really to look at three questions.  One was forth; two, to evaluate the Committee So, first of all, can the Chairman construct a forecast?  I think under when we design these experiments-to ensure that they not overtake MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The purpose of this particular set of parameters whether the Chairman can construct a forecast under the conditions we set how the input was provided to the Chairman; and then, three, to evaluate how considered the forecast. these conditions, we tried to do it in a very low-touch way.  We wanted to make sure that this would not in some way overtake the other important work of the Committee.  We really triedand should continue to try the central work of what the Committee needs to be doing.  And I think from that perspective, this set of parameters worked.

was very light I saw the initial forecast and then the consensus reasons were, had no idea who had provided what actually interested in knowing who had said what, not for any I wanted to know, were they broad-based reasons?  Are these It was noteworthy, anyway, that there was no sense as to why the forecast coming into the meeting, listening to exactly what people were going to bring into go-round.  Also, I would note that in this experiment, we didn't have an really that more formal mechanism that could be used I could see, in another round, using the SEP as that vehicle and In terms of evaluating how the input is provided to the Chairman, again, it touch.  I, for example, wasn't sure, when forecast, why it had changed.  And when I saw that it had changed, I was curious as to why it had changed, but really had no sense as to what the kind of input.  I found myself particular personal reasons, but regional differences? had changed.  And I don't think that's an undesirable feature.  I think that that made me all the more curious the economic policy SEP, and so without an SEP, there wasn't to feed into the Chairman.  But then leaving it to the Chairman and the staff to massage it, come up with something that looks

July 31-August 1, 2012

like a forecast.  And it would then be, again, a minimal heavy lift, I think, on members of the Committee.

the Committee considers the forecast, we had bigger questions to think about, and we forecast would be asked before the policy go-round.  It would be asked the economic go-round and before the policy go-round.  I also think that in terms of how I don't think we've even decided point of disagreement.  But we haven't yet this is something that becomes a 'stake in the ground' that there will be disagreement and what would warrant disagreement.  Having a single next, second incremental step.  I think that Bill Dudley's ideas of the I would still advocate proceeding On the third point, the question of evaluating how that struck me as very choppy.  I think that we did it.  We didn't want that question asked in the middle of our meeting today, because essentially thought that would be distracting.  But ideally, that question of how the Committee wants to respond to the consensus after the Committee considers the forecast, some of Sandy's questions about what warrants dissent matter.  'Dissent,' by the way, is a strong word here because that this would be a point of dissent; it might be a thought through whether registered dissents on, or policy assumption-again, this was very fuzzy, and I think putting some more structure around that would probably be a 'grand enchilada' of what we could do are all aspirational, but with a very incremental and low-touch kind of approach.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Stein.

only thought I had, and I guess I came to Lockhart articulated and a number of good idea to have the forecast be your example, that which came out of the previous meeting, as opposed to some notion of MR. STEIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The this independently, is exactly the same point that President others have since endorsed, which is, I think it would be a based on an exogenously anchored policy path-for example, exactly as in President Lockhart:

July 31-August 1, 2012

and just making our own task of this primarily as a communications device and we're trying to tell the choosing to make a particular policy action, I think it just makes And let me give an extreme, stylized example, which will Imagine that we had a single mandate and all we cared about was 2 percent got it into our heads that we were worried about You want to explain why you do the forecast based on your endogenously optimal path, all that inflation will be 2 percent.  You'll see the rates moving around, but you'll never we hadn't taken action, gone wrong.'  Whereas in a fixed path, you can say, 'Well, if we had going to go up,' and then it'll make it natural.  And of course, doing what Vice Chairman Dudley suggests, by having multiple in either thing is that you need an anchor.  That's come out in the a concept. an endogenously optimal path.  Aside from simplifying things easier, if we're thinking world the story of why we're the communication much clearer. exaggerate the point: inflation in the long run.  And suppose we inflation expectations in 2015 picking up, so we needed to raise rates. you raised rates.  Well, if you'll see is be able to say, 'Well, there's this counterfactual world where, if something would have kept to our old policy, rates were you could augment this by paths.  But I think the key discussion, and I just wanted to endorse that as

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Powell.

QMPR constitute a better place to be.  It's a better end state than what a lot of like the idea that it's mandatory, but as Governor Duke pointed out, for calling on the same staff MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Just a couple of things.  First, I do think that a consensus forecast and we have now, and I think we're making progress toward it.  I'll admit that it is orders of magnitude more complicated and difficult than I had any thought that it might be.  I like ideas around the table.  I Governors-for me, anyway-the Tealbook is hugely important in developing my-so far, one-SEP.  And to try to do it two weeks before the Tealbook, we'd be

July 31-August 1, 2012

putting the SEP together.  So I don't know what the answer is with that, but also like some of Bill's ideas.  Bottom line:  I great idea to go ahead.  Without a lot more meetings like this or a lot of the subcommittee and others, I'm not I'd come out on these things.  I will agree, though, that having an exogenous policy So I like that, and I'll just leave it at that. two weeks before it's a difference, I think, from the presidents.  I think it's definitely a time spent with Governor Yellen and Governor Raskin and sure where path is, to quote President Bullard, a brilliant idea. Thanks.

forecast should be, in some sense, ex ante or ex post and how we should CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  This has been very helpful. I've heard a lot of support for the concept in general.  A couple of ideas that were raised were the questions of whether the specify policy paths.  Governor Yellen, did you have anything else?

No. MS. YELLEN.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any final comments?

MR. DUDLEY.  And table 2.

And table 2 was very popular.  Good.  Unless there are year.  Thank you very much. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. other comments, we'll adjourn the meeting.  The next meeting will be on Wednesday and Thursday, September 12 and 13 of this
