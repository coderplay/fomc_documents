As part of accounts of that influence. reason to think that it didn't succeed, although it is difficult to know with the BEA has not yet revised the national accounts prior to longer sample periods are not useful for assumption seasonality doesn't explain last quarter's weak real GDP reading. One common hypothesis regarding the first-quarter dip in real GDP growth is that it reflects residual seasonality.  We are skeptical last year's annual revision, the BEA attempted to purge the We see no any confidence because 2013.  As a result, analyses that use determining the answer.  For now, though, we are proceeding under the that residual

The first is slowdown was real but will prove to be transitory.  The slowdown in GDP growth was concentrated in consumer spending, and there is a good basis for thinking that households took a bit of sales, one of the few indicators that can be measured accurately in real down from a very high level in the fourth quarter of last year. retail sales are estimated the red line in panel 2, the Federal Reserve Bank of on board a broader range of than just the spending data, has portrayed a steadier profile of real activity labor market point to solid improvement:  In March, the unemployment rate came in lower than our previous projection, and the participation rate was have remained low of late.  The BLS's first estimate of March payroll employment was the weather-both the form of warmer-than-usual temperatures in February that probably caused form of the major winter storm that hit well above the 90,000 to to be consistent with steady pressures in the labor consumer sentiment continue to be upbeat, they see jobs as easy to find indicators of business activity have generally remained territory. However, as you can see from Chicago's National Activity Index, which takes indicators in the past and continues to do so now.  Among the additional indicators taken into account by the Chicago index, the recent data from the continued ¼ percentage point ¼ percentage point higher.  In addition, initial jobless claims remarkably growth was disappointing, but we think the main culprit there in some hiring to be moved forward and in the the Northeast in March.  Smoothing through these swings, the three-month average pace of payroll job gains in March-shown in panel 3-was 120,000 range that we estimate market.  In addition, measures of including a sizable plurality of households reporting that rather than hard to get, while well in expansionary

For the first half of this year, we now expect real about 2 percent at an annual rate, slightly stronger than in our March medium-term projection is little changed from round.

Further out, our March, reflecting relatively minor changes to our key conditioning factors this

As our overall assessment of the economy's current margin of slack with the news from the labor market, we now attribute a slightly larger fraction of the unemployment rate and factors.  Specifically, this round we edged down our estimate of the natural rate of

By the end of 2019, the unemployment rate is rate, as in the previous projection. unemployment by 0.1 percentage point, to 4.9 percent, trend labor projected to be around 4 percent-a percentage point below our revised estimate of the natural of models that aim to estimate the cyclical position by pooling a range of indicators.  Panel 6 gives the one such model.  Importantly, this model incorporates a Phillips curve, the news on inflation in generating its slack estimate.  The model first-quarter data that we had in hand as of the April closing date, including our Tealbook first-quarter real GDP growth model balanced the weaker-than-expected stronger-than-expected As you know, we have been developing a suite economy's results from and so it factors in knows about all of the Tealbook's forecast, but it doesn't know about the rebound we are projecting for GDP growth in the second quarter.

We think few of these soft readings, such as the ones for apparel and for lodging away are likely to rebound.  Accordingly, we offset some of last month's inflation projection in the next few months-a procedure, albeit in the other direction, to the one we followed in January surprised us to the upside.  A stronger projected path of import also pushed up the near-term forecast of core PCE inflation a little. Panels 7 and 8 on the next page summarize the inflation outlook.  The March inflation data were notably lower concentrated in the core much-ballyhooed drop in wireless services prices.  That said, other that a from home, forecast error by nudging up our core very similar when the price data prices

Over the 12 months ending in March, the overall 1.8 percent, while the core index increased we now expect the 12-month change for the median longer-run inflation expectation measure in the Michigan surveyred line in panel 10-was 2.4 percent in April, close to a record low.  A smoothed changes, the resulting trend-the green line-falls less sharply, though its by historical standards.  Among the various expected measures we track, the Michigan measure shows by far the steepest erosion in inflation expectations is way, but we continue to view that risk as material. The the version of the series-the blue line-has declined steadily during the past few years. We have been attributing a portion of that slide to the low rates of headline inflation in 2015 and 2016.  Indeed, if we try to control for the influence of food and energy price current level is still low inflation downtrend, so it is not obvious that a broader under

In the remainder of my September 2016-namely, the differential unemployment experience of African Americans and Hispanics relative to use the brilliant book titled Putnam.  In this latest book, Putnam divides less, and the middle third comprises those who have As a jumping-off point for that discussion, I will Our Kids , by Harvard sociologist Robert American society roughly in thirds by educational attainment:  The top third comprises those with a college degree or more, the bottom third comprises those with a high-school degree or something in between-generally some college or perhaps an associate's degree from a career-oriented or community college.

Two facts are apparent from these two scatter plots:  First, the right, as experience a much more severe version of the aggregate fluctuations in unemployment than do whites.  When the unemployment rate for whites college degree or more increases 1 percentage point, the unemployment rate for similarly credentialed blacks goes up by an estimated 1.7 percentage points in the early sample and 2 percentage points in the late sample.  Second, there is no evidence here of toward that same result relative experience of is somewhat flatter than in the case of African Americans.  Second, there modest convergence, as you can see from the fact that the blue red lines.  Further investigation will be we can conclude that the apparent lack of convergence Hispanics bear Exhibit 14 shows that mostly similar results hold in the Hispanics and whites.

First, the upside.  As articulated on slide period, incoming indicators raised the possibility be stronger than in our baseline.  This should be although such improved conditions could also engender a stronger monetary policy response in some advanced foreign economies than we have built this was when euro-area data came out and markets breathed a sigh increased accommodative policy stance.

the natural rate of that a little is where the natural rate is.  Nobody knows for the Committee over the past 30 or 40 years, it seems like when I'm if you could talk about your confidence in our current assessment. MR. KASHKARI.  David, you ticked down your estimate of unemployment and ticked up labor force participation.  Could you talk to me about bit?  Obviously a critical determination for us sure.  As I've read the history of the Committee errs, it errs in overestimating the natural rate rather than underestimating it. just curious

Let me start with the participation rate, because I think the story is a little bit clearer.  The participation rate had been moving relatively moved up above our estimate of a trend to a we were a little uncomfortable with how wide that gap had become.  Because of the cohort effects.  We don't have very much information on them.  And so about the result of trend for the 16-to-24-year-old group. MR. WASCHER.  I'll take this one. there sideways and against the downward trend, and it place at which that, we reexamined some of our underlying trend estimates, which we do by demographic group, and it looked to us like we had a trend for the younger group, the 16-to-24 year olds, that was too negative.  That trend is a much more difficult for us to estimate because it's hard to determine three-fourths of the upward revision we made to the trend, which is pretty small, is raising the

We had previously labor force or unemployment to disability as a permanent state. still pretty persistent, but it looked like it was a little less permanent than we had thought made us comfortable revising up our trend participation rate a little bit. from disability, and we looked into that.  We looked at Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia had done, and we were convinced going on.  So that was another source of an upward revision to the viewed people moving from the It's before, and that

I think, was a harder call for us.  The inflation data don't give us a lot of Certainly, on the side that is true.  Using the wage data, the Phillips curve is not quite as flat, and there, David mentioned, haven't really been surprised given our current in line with our estimate of slack in the labor market, in order to what we refer to as an 'Okun's law error' that would have become uncomfortably large any changes.  And so it just seemed to us like it was also a sensible thing to do-to nudge the natural rate. The natural rate, signal about the natural rate because the short-run Phillips curve is so flat. price actually, our models, as estimate of the natural rate and low productivity growth.  But, nonetheless, we were trying to get our estimate of the output gap reduce absent down slightly our estimate of

I believe Thomas surrounding one of our model estimates of the natural rate, and it's pretty wide. MR. WILCOX. MR. WASCHER.  Maybe a percentage point each way.

Okay, that was going to be my follow-up.  Is it conceivable that two 4.9, it was really 4.5?  Is that very MR. KASHKARI. years from now we look back, and though we thought it was possible?

MR. WILCOX.  Absolutely.

MR. KASHKARI.  Okay.  Thanks.

The only way in which I think I would respectfully disagree with the the staff, toward the end of tend to get a little enthusiastic about the natural rate.  We don't see couple of cycles we've pushed down the natural rate as an are more muted than one would have believed, rate.  Retrospectively, we've tended to go back and boost our estimates of rate because in the rearview mirror it appears that the economy actually was a little economy went into recession.  So, this time around, I been reserved in our approach to revising down our estimate of the natural rate, not to commit some new error this time but also keeping very much in mind the fact aren't calling for a downward revision in natural rate at this point. MR. WILCOX. premise of your question is that my recollection is that, speaking for expansions, I think we inflation emerging, and in the past explanation why those inflationary pressures given a higher natural the natural overheated, generally speaking, as the think we've only hoping not that the errors from our wage and price indexes really the

MR. LAUBACH.  Not for the output gap.  I only have the confidence bound for the natural rate.

multiple will work pretty well here.  Unless can beat me to the draw, I'll just say that if the confidence interval around the percentage point, then I would guess that it might be as large as from the state-space model.  By MR. WILCOX.  However, an Okun's-law Bill Wascher unemployment rate is a 2 percentage points around the output gap estimate that comes 2018, I think it would be on the verge of becoming statistically significant.

And then I have a question on the foreign financial stability, which is 'Material for Briefing on the International Outlook.'  For April also been a lot of tensions on the peninsula.  Are outside the purview of what we would put in this matrix, or would you put them at 'moderate' on the basis of those developments? MR. BULLARD. the matrix on the last slide in the 2017, we have South Korea ranked as 'low,' and I just wondered:  That country has had a big political scandal, and there obviously have those things least at

It's definitely true that you're not the first to play this up.  We don't have risk of nuclear war here in our matrix.  There are a number of things, purely on the financial look good in South Korea.  The financial sector has moderate risk.  The levels are low, and it's running a Valuation pressures are moderate, and it has relatively robust So those have all contributed to our assessment of 'low' overall. MS.

Okay, so is this meant to reflect the potential for financial instability in United States, or is it a statement about whether that own, faces financial-stability risk? MR. BULLARD. that particular country to spill over to the country, just taken on its

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Williams. CHAIR

Thank you, Madam Chair.  I was going to comment, or maybe it's to the QS report-so this is probably for Rochelle-and it's really a broad question about how do we think about price-to-book ratios for large banks?  In MR. WILLIAMS. actually a question.  It relates more of the QS report on page 14 of 97, you reported that financial leverage in the banking sector remains low and pointed to chart 3-2 on page 15 of 97, which shows the price-to-book ratios for selected bank holding companies.

How do we think about banks that have such I have two specific questions about of thinking about risks to the banking system.  The first question is about Many of them have price-to-book ratios well below one even today.  What does that mean for the resilience of these banks in the

in terms of their vulnerabilities and in terms of their ability to survive in low price-to-book ratios a very stressed environment?

the domestic banks, as even there we are are now at levels of about 1 or above that, think, what do I make of that?  Is that just a reflection of a stricter about new business models or changes in business models in those 'new normal' for the financial system?  And, if anything, what is resilience in terms of the large banks and the Those are my questions. My second, very related question concerns seeing significant improvement.  Price-to-book ratios but still well below the levels-about 2 or higher-that we saw before the financial crisis.  And, again, I'm just trying to regulatory environment?  Is it large banks?  Is it just part of a this telling me about, again, vulnerabilities or broader financial system?

Comparing it with, say, the past, the higher values in the past probably do perceptions that were maybe being out of line and not properly seeing the risk that in the earlier environment.  It's obviously an indicator of profitability, and it's an raise equity.  So higher price-to-book ratios, say above 1, would suggest a equity.  And lower price-to-book ratios would reflect difficulties with profitability and difficulties in raising equity. MS. EDGE. reflect risk was there indicator of ability to better ability for raising actual

Back before the crisis, there were just much higher returns MR. ROSENGREN.  Let me correlation between return on equity and price-to-book and, to your point, profitability.

It suggests that this would lead to an increase in the credit and notes that the United States lacks the macroprudential tools in the real other countries have.

When I look at the report in the financial sector remaining low and capital ratios at the bank holding by historical standards, as it relates to the largest firms, I find this of concern about this vulnerability has gone up the discussions we hear today about potential regulatory reform, which of I want to echo, a little bit, the comments of Governor Fischer. on leverage companies that are high encouraging.

Despite buoyant business-sector optimism collected in the GDP growth.  This is exactly what has occurred, with the preliminary Q1 coming in at an annual during Q2, but not enough to meaningfully alter For those who wish to assign the 0.7 percent growth rate seasonality, then we should be willing to subtract some amount from the and Q4, because those would be overstated due to residual seasonality.  I have not noticed this type of adjustment in previous years when residual seasonality was an issue.  We tend to apply only to the first quarter as if it wouldn't apply to

these issues, I think it may be better to track year-over-year real GDP growth during this period, especially because a lot of analysts that observe the U.S. economy know that there aren't problems with the de-seasonalization of the better approach would be just to talk more about year-over-year growth and not try to just downplay the seasonal issue. In light of rates that you can de-seasonalize the de-seasonalized data and get significant seasonals, and because of that it's hard to peddle a story GDP data.  So I think a rates lower, now at on a year-over-year basis.

My interpretation is that labor input has pace of about 1.5 percent per year and that this, combined with about an output growth rate in the neighborhood of growing at approximately 1½ percent measured If anything, this might slow down.

Given my estimate of the natural rate current unemployment rate already at 4½ percent, my forecast anticipates additional overshooting of full employment.

We are currently about inflation and full potential for conditions for the next few years, with the unemployment rate plummeting to 4 percent in 2019, despite four cessation to follow on President Rosengren's comments and highlight the fact that real GDP growth of only for several years in a row to get the economy back to a sustainable level of recession.

DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My views on the economy changed much since the previous meeting.  I'm inclined, along with most of the rest of March inflation think we're still likely to be on the same trajectory as we were before-about a 2 percent and a very gradual rise in inflation back toward the 2 percent objective. VICE CHAIRMAN haven't you, to discount both the weak first-quarter GDP reading and the softness in the data.  I real GDP growth rate the growth outlook, I see both positives and negatives, and many others a disconnect between the harder data that feed directly into the GDP figures 'print' itself and the softer data, such as the sentiment indexes and the activity indexes, that don't.  This is reflected in the relatively high reading the Federal New York nowcast had for first-quarter real GDP growth of 2.7 percent.  Our Turning first to have noted there is and the first-quarter GDP ISM Reserve Bank of nowcast puts some weight on the softer data because these data, historically at least, have provided information about the quarterly real GDP growth rate, but they obviously did poorly in the first quarter.

If we see that the slowdown in consumer spending evident in Q1 isn't just a forecast. A related puzzle is between the softness in consumer spending in the first high level of consumer spending growth, reflecting the combination of solid job gains, rising real wage and salaries, compensation inflation, and rising household wealth.

CHAIR comments on the economic outlook and risks.  Let me about incoming data and conditions as continuing to improve.  Payroll growth slowed to 100,000 in March, but slowdown was likely weather remains solid at 180,000 per month.  In addition, the unemployment rate moved down to 4½ percent, U-6 declined notably, and other Wage growth looks to be firming a that the continued demographic pressures may also be a sign that to grow, but in the first quarter, but, like most of you, I am also not inclined to take much signal from in the period ahead.  As David noted, much of the recent PCE slowdown was unusually mild, and the Q1 decline in auto sales was from a Q4 level income growth remaining solid, household wealth Regarding the overall economy, GDP, and especially consumer spending, decelerated sharply these data for growth likely reflected transitory factors.  For example, outlays of consumer energy services have been soft because the winter that was probably unsustainably high.  With

KASHKARI.  Just a follow-up to the earlier question I asked David about the natural rate President Williams wants to jump the upside.  When I think about the

persistent low wage increases and persistent low inflation, intuitively like if we're making a mistake of overestimating the natural rate of unemployment, but any data you could point to or is look back and realize, 5½, it wasn't 4.9?  How do we explain making the opposite error that I'm unemployment, in light of it feels the error bars look symmetric.  I'm just wondering, are there there a story you could tell on why, a year or two from now, we might well, it was really concerned about?

idea I could come up with is to look back in the past to see you were in one direction or another.  This type of model framework to that because you can compare real-time estimates with estimates and see a systematic revision pattern.

As President Rosengren think that we have time to look at the data to see how they unfold before we make a of the actual statement in alternative B, the one word I would ask is the word 'wealth' from paragraph 1.  The way it reads is, 'Household real income and wealth continued to rise and sentiment remained high.'  When I read this, 'wealth' jumped out at me as a reference made me uncomfortable.  I asked my staff to look back over time, the last time the word 'wealth' was included in a statement.

During the Committee argued that the large balance sheet put This remains in the statement in the last may no sense for us to put downward pressure on medium- and longer-term yields at the rates by raising the policy rate. I think alternative B does a reasonable job of describing the policy situation for today.

However, during the period of a rising policy rate, which we are in now, it longer make same time as we are trying to raise the general level of all an increase of rate is transmitted further out along the yield curve is what gives monetary policy its effect through current balance sheet is a kind of twist operation, which I think does not have a basis in received monetary policy as soon as produce a partial reduction in the downward pressure on medium- and yields we were previously applying.  Even with that move, however, the large remain for some time, and some of the yield effects will remain. In conventional descriptions of how monetary policy works, the fact that the policy punch.

Inflation is near 2 percent, and the risks surrounding the outlook are With monetary policy still accommodative, the gradual upward path of interest rates meeting, the question is not step on the path but whether today is the day to do it.  Although a today is consistent with my outlook, which is little changed since our meeting, the public is not expecting the Committee to act today, in view of the weaker readings and the fact that the Committee's communications haven't prepared the for an increase today.  I understand the rationale for pausing today, as indicated in B.  However, if the economy evolves over the intermeeting period as expected, I'd be turned into a longer delay.

I will very briefly tilt against the windmill here. effort in paragraph 1-to go into all of the news since the previous pretty long lags, and we need to be very forward looking.  And I think sometimes we ourselves into these situations and put in the new language again.  I don't think that's my point here was that through the first-quarter transitory noise. good job on that and positions us well, as many have said, raise the federal funds rate in June, barring a meaningful deterioration in the outlook, or I think it hits the right tone there. But, overall, the language appropriately looks The sentence in paragraph 2 does a either to to reassess the data.  So

momentum in the economy that we discussed We have reached or exceeded full employment with underlying inflation only modestly below our 2 percent goal.  Furthermore, with the yesterday, we could be well beyond full employment in the next year or two.  That's why, like

conditions, particularly the outlook, to support three more rate the start of normalization of the balance sheet also by late this year. the Tealbook, I expect economic increases this year and this is a sensible policy approach on the basis of my modal forecast.  But rate increases.  As unemployment rate well below its natural rate means that we correct that, and that will generate very slow growth for a number of Also, the possibility of sizable the fiscal and other policies could actually cut either way-for positioning ourselves to the path of policy by taking a rate increase sooner rather than later.  Then we can adjust I think risk-management considerations also support a continued gradual path of President Rosengren and others have mentioned, there's a very real risk of overheating the economy significantly.  Pushing the will need to eventually years as we try to get the economy back in a sustainable place. fiscal stimulus does argue on net-although I agree completely with President Kaplan's remarks that adjust later as we learn more about what the policies are.

I'll note that I think that we can separate the reinvestment policy decisions we're making from the near-term funds rate path.  Obviously, they're connected.  They are important to that the market's expectations today about the trajectory of our balance sheet right, and markets have taken our hints of impending normalization in stride.  So our balance sheet normalization will essentially confirm our past an overly adverse with the balance sheet normalization. Lastly, going to be both highly relevant to thinking about the stance of monetary policy.  I do think it's remind ourselves look about future announcements on communications and market expectations, and, therefore, I don't expect market reaction as we move forward to comment very briefly on Governor Powell's remarks about losing an many years of inflation running below target, or the I would like inflation anchor or the nominal anchor after risks of that.  I am also very concerned about that aspect of having inflation-a number of people

this-continuously or consistently run below target and then eroding people's We heard some evidence on that about whether our target really is what we need to do is get inflation convincingly back to 2 percent.  That think that's something we that we don't lose this anchor. talked about expectations of inflation. symmetric.  I think that means at least a 50 percent probability of being above 2 percent, and I need to do to make sure to mention that if we thought, in the future, about perhaps a better issue, if we had some type of price-level target rather than many I'm not arguing for that for today.

DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  I for a minute.  I think it's actually appropriate in the statement because I think it spending.  That's why we're including it, Including it in the statement doesn't imply that there's market put, just that this is a part of the consumption function.  It's also particularly rapidly both through the rise in It's not the statement, but I really do think it doesn't suggest a stock It's just that household wealth is an important part of the consumption function, and changed a lot over the past six months.  That's one of the reasons why we're relatively slowdown in first-quarter consumption is going to turn out to be transitory more permanent.  I think that's why it was in there.  I'm perfectly happy to accept the VICE CHAIRMAN think 'wealth' is going to be taken out, in light of the sentiment around the table, but I want to defend 'wealth' is a factor that should lend support to consumer because we think it's actually significant. a stock relevant now because wealth actually has been increasing quite the stock market post the election and the fact that home prices are going up a lot. important to me that this be kept in market put. it's optimistic that the rather than

When you put it all is more likely than not, but that it's not a done deal, and that we do remain data this meeting. In general, I communicate.  Paragraph 1, I think, had since the previous FOMC meeting in a way that weight on either March. slowdown in the first-quarter real GDP together, I would anticipate that market participants will read the statement as indicating that a June move dependent.  That seems to be the appropriate message to send at

to get final agreement on our balance sheet approach.  Then we with the decision made at either the September or December meeting.  But that process, I think getting the framework in place would be worthwhile. At the next meeting, I hope we will be able normalization plans, and I hope we will publish the bullets that explain our can see how the economy evolves and whether we want to start the process later this year, presumably regardless of when we actually decide to start and broadly understood by market participants close to our expectations and we funds rate and begin to normalize the balance the same FOMC meeting.  There were two reasons for what little pause.  First, pulling both levers of raising our federal funds rate target Finally, assuming that the economy does evolve continue to raise the target range of the federal sheet, I wouldn't want to do both at I put out there, the and announcing the beginning of balance sheet normalization simultaneously would make it more difficult for us to interpret any financial market reactions.  Second, I think that when we do

Once you get over the bar, there's a relatively high period of weak data that occurred before versus after the process.  If the weak data were to occur before you reversed your earlier decisions.  This threshold effect means that even welldecisions can have market consequences when the threshold is crossed and the policy action is initiated. announce the decision to begin to normalize the balance monetary policy even if it's widely anticipated. threshold effects threshold to reversing course compared with before you had made that decision.  Consider, for example, how we'd likely react to a decision to begin the balance sheet normalization the potential decision, you'd probably be inclined to wait.  In contrast, if it were to occur immediately afterward, you probably would be more likely to look through the weak data for a time before anticipated anticipated begin to normalize our balance sheet will be a tightening big outsized reaction by also announcing a rate hike at the same meeting?  It seems prudent to me that we not take both actions simultaneously unless we want to tighten low-inflation world in which we currently operate, I of urgency.  I think it would be good just to take this off the table-so that market participants aren't concerned If I'm right that the decision to of uncertain magnitude, I guess the question I would ask is:  Why would we want to compound the risk of a much more monetary policy aggressively, and, in the don't think we are close to needing to demonstrate that type for the Committee that we could be very aggressive and pull both levers simultaneously-and that's why I want to raise that issue today.  Thank you.

YELLEN.  Okay.  I think we have general agreement on alternative B and need settle the issue of 'wealth.'  I have heard considerable support for President Kashkari's in, and I CHAIR to suggestion to remove 'wealth.'  The Vice Chairman expressed a reason to keep it

May 2-3, 2017

the Vice Chairman expressed.  You probably can hand, like the Vice Chairman, I don't feel this given two reasons.  I think it is very to explain why we have confidence, as we express in paragraph 2, that consumption pick up, and this helps do it.  I don't think it's absolutely necessary.  But before we this issue, let me offer anybody else who wants to weigh in a chance to do so.  Governor would say that I agree with the reasons that now understand why it's there.  But, on the other is a life or death matter, and even without 'wealth,' we have important growth will decide Fischer.

putting the word 'wealth' in implied that stock market goes down, I might agree, but 'wealth' is it out and never use it again because it gives this to me ridiculous, and I don't see why we should go down this route of MR. FISCHER.  Madam Chair, if I thought that there's a put on the FOMC every time the such a common word.  We're going to take connotation?  It seems political correctness, when it's not even logical.

YELLEN.  Well, we do the same thing with the exchange rate-we're very loath matters for both net exports and inflation.  However, we go to great lengths not to mention the for a similar reason-to avoid any possible misinterpretation that we have a target So I think that's also an example of 'political correctness.' CHAIR to mention the exchange rate.  I think, similarly, it certainly national income, as well as exchange rate for the exchange rate.

not political correctness.  That is related to a particular policy we into account.  First of all, it's not our policy tool, in foreign exchange markets.  But I don't understand this one, that there's a put.  And I think if we start inventing things, somebody might not going to speak the truth to anybody.  It took me a long time to understand a things that I think are MR. FISCHER.  That's follow, which is, we do not want to take that and, second, we don't intervene and I just don't see think we're variety of the conventions that exist with regard to the statement in which

meanings if you were here in 2003 and remembered meant then-that's very disconcerting.  I don't think we should want to get rid of in any way.  I don't see anything wrong with everybody's wealth going up. identical turn out to have totally different what it had 'wealth'

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kashkari.

is a But I'll just say this in response to Vice Chairman Dudley's comments:  Why December.  This was true in February.  This was true in March. true.  As a general agree with it.  I just can't understand why we're adding it now. MR. KASHKARI.  I've never been accused of being politically correct before.  This first.  [Laughter] now?  This was true in Whenever we make a change, market participants are begging, 'Okay.  Why did they add this this month as opposed to the month before?'  So everything you said was statement, I

DUDLEY.  I would say because consumption was quite weak in the trying to explain why we're not taking much signal from that weakness. VICE CHAIRMAN first quarter, and we're

It provides an explanation for the second sentence in the second MR. ROSENGREN. paragraph.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Exactly.

So it's explaining why we think that the weakness in consumption reasons.  But this explanation is clearly supporting why we MR. ROSENGREN. is transitory.  There are a number of think household spending will be stronger.

DUDLEY. Right. VICE CHAIRMAN

It gives three elements.  If I was to run a consumption function, the in paragraph 2 is so key, this is setting up the explanation for MR. ROSENGREN. element that I drop off would be consumer sentiment, not wealth.  So I think that, because the addition to the second sentence

May 2-3, 2017

going to be transitory.  Without that, I think it's a less why we're fairly convinced that it's compelling case.

if we dropped it, but I think it's actually a an important modifier regarding how we because if it were in the opposite direction, if we'd had a 10 percent market, it would affect us, and it has in the past. I agree that it wouldn't be the end of the world bad precedent to drop something that we think is estimate consumption decline in the stock did affect monetary policy.  It didn't affect monetary policy because of Federal Reserve targeting of stock prices.  It affected monetary policy because the the consumption function was going to look like after the and how it might affect business spending as well as household spending. In 1987, the crash any Committee was worried about what crash

actually does belong in the first paragraph at times when it's modifying the end of the world if we include it or not So I think it something like household spending.  I don't think it's include it.  But I do think there's a pretty solid rationale for doing so.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Evans.

Listening to this, I think if you're a macroeconomist, consumption function and all of that, right?  I in there either, but that's jargon, and so MR. EVANS.  Okay, I guess I will. you're not bothered by this, thinking about the mean, you wouldn't mind putting 'permanent income' 'wealth' is sort of another type of comment.

I looked at the 0.1 percent, and .001 percent.'  This is more that this is not about macroeconomics has a loaded connotation at the moment.  That's why conditions if you thought that to two, I think that that's acceptable. I'll be honest with you.  President Kashkari, you mentioned 'put.' statement.  I wrote down '50 percent, 1 percent, about income distribution and who has the wealth.  I think but perceptions of the public, and 'wealth' I suggested 'balance sheet' or something that gets at the financial that was important, but if you can reduce it

Do you have suggested language on 'balance sheet'? folks who really write the statement.  I think 'real income and conditions have improved.' CHAIR YELLEN. MR. EVANS.  No, I just said 'balance sheet conditions,' but I don't know that that would really pass muster with the balance sheet

'household balance sheets are strong,' something like that? CHAIR YELLEN.  Or MR. EVANS.  Could be, yes.

DUDLEY.  The problem with that is that it seems insensitive to all sheets. VICE CHAIRMAN those households that don't have strong balance

CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes.

May 2-3, 2017

my whole point MR. EVANS.  Or all those households that don't have wealth.  That's about 50 percent and 1 percent.

did you want to comment? CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes.  David, some trepidation.  I wanted to mention that removed as an explicit factor, that might put a little more of the spotlight on income. noting that in the BEA release, real DPI increased at an annual rate of 1 percent in a little less than we had projected in the Tealbook.  We're not particularly that, because we think about half of that shortfall is in transfer income, and up in the second quarter.  That said, I wondered whether language that is general might be helpful, something along the lines of 'But the fundamentals it away from resting quite so much on an income number that's a little softer than MR. WILCOX.  I enter the conversation with if wealth is And it's worth the first quarter, concerned about that's going to be made a little more underpinning continued growth of household spending remain solid.'  What that would do is generalize many analysts had expected.

YELLEN.  Will you say that again? CHAIR

the that we got yesterday was a little into our assessment of conditions. MR. WILCOX.  'But the fundamentals underpinning the continued growth of household spending remain solid.'  For background, you can see the projected trajectories of some of relevant variables on page 4 of Tealbook A.  What this does is, it gives you a little bit broader time perspective, and I would add that the house price reading stronger than what we had projected.  So house prices certainly factor balance sheet

YELLEN.  Okay.  I think that's a good suggestion.  Let me ask for some reaction CHAIR to David's suggestion that we would say 'Household spending rose only modestly, but the fundamentals underpinning the continued growth of household spending remain solid.'

Leave that? YELLEN.  No.  We get rid of it.  That's part of the fundamentals. MR. HARKER.  And 'consumer sentiment remained high?' CHAIR MR. HARKER.  Okay.

DUDLEY.  Seems fine with me. VICE CHAIRMAN

YELLEN.  It's fine with me, too.  Governor Powell. CHAIR

it, only we're saying 'household spending' twice.  Maybe say second time.  But I like this approach. MR. POWELL.  I like 'such spending' the read it, it sounded inelegant, but I was worried that I MR. WILCOX.  Hearing the Chair was engaging in Tealbook editing.

YELLEN.  'Growth of consumer spending' instead of 'household'? CHAIR MR. WILCOX.  Or 'such spending.'

YELLEN.  How many people are favorably inclined toward David's substitutethat, David.  That's a So I would suggest we substitute that.  Let's make sure we have this fundamentals underpinning the CHAIR would you just raise your hand?  Okay, I actually see a lot of support for really good suggestion. right:  'Household spending rose only modestly, but the continued growth of such spending remained solid.'

DUDLEY.  Yes.  We could say 'consumption'-'of consumption VICE CHAIRMAN remains solid.'

'Remains'-how about 'remained'?  Of what? CHAIR YELLEN.

DUDLEY.  'If consumption remains solid.'  I don't know that you say 'of consumption.' VICE CHAIRMAN have to say 'such spending.'  Just

CHAIR YELLEN.  How about 'of consumption' and 'remained solid.'

MS. MESTER.  'Growth,' right?  'Consumption growth,' as opposed to just 'consumption'?

YELLEN.  'Of consumption growth.' CHAIR

MR. WILCOX.  Well, in what I had suggested

DUDLEY.  Yes. VICE CHAIRMAN

FISCHER.  Yes. MR.

CHAIR YELLEN.  All right.  I think we're ready to vote.  Brian, could you just make clear what we're voting on?  [Laughter]

Lorie mentioned, differs from the original staff proposal in that redeemed each month-in other words, the amount of market will have to absorb-rather than on the percentage of maturities and that will be reinvested each month.  Focusing on the amount redeemed each month like the right metric if one of our primary goals is to minimize the risks of market volatile from month to to differences in monthly Treasury security maturities.

In contrast, I find focusing directly on the number of other advantages compared with the original proposal.

This means that during the initial stages of bit faster in those low-volume A second advantage is that the revised proposal addresses more maturities are very high, the quarterly The caps limit the amount of redemptions in those months.

I strongly believe that we should taper rather than stop sheet, which should to our announcement that we are shrinking the We are starting by reducing the balance sheet by less than $10 billion for each of $4½ trillion balance sheet.  So I think that certainly is gradual. Regarding question 1(a), reinvestments.

Maximum dollars redeemed on a regular schedule is and is somewhat smoother.  The communication is closer to how the purchase net, I think the cap proposal is and is predictable.

However, under that proposal, after the phaseout period, which months would have been very redemptions of MBS as well could have So, for me, there were shortcomings and challenges with the I thought weeks ago, was reasonable.  In particular, the taper feature under that plan would have helped market participants become accustomed to a declining Treasury securities was 18 months, redemptions of Treasury securities in some sizable, and, depending on the path of interest rates, been sizable and variable.

As discussed in the expected date of normalization this approach seems to provide insurance against tail risks at approach is straightforward and, in my view, should be easy to communicate that's why I

thoughts:  First, I guess I was thinking more of doing this in the fall for effect first quarter of next year.  I think that's preferable.

So it isn't clear to me that we should A couple of in the gets a that would provoke some sort of another

I was very pleased by the market's reception of the earlier discussion, and I think there's a decent chance that in this case there predictable we're regarding some sort of a floor system, something that I top half of exhibit 2, which, without using the term 'floor clearly to a floor system.  So I like that language as written.  Thank you, Finally, we've had a large number of discussions about the long-run framework, which have shown a pretty strong consensus favor.  I like the language in the system,' refers very Madam Chair.

I Now, I could just stop there, but that a change in our reinvestment later this year.  We also reiterated the key elements of our in the long run.  And our FOMC statements have also set out a clear criterion of the At our March FOMC meeting, the prevailing view was policy would likely be appropriate strategy-reducing holdings in a gradual, predictable, and passive manner and primarily holding Treasury securities for starting to draw down our balance sheet-that is, after normalization of the level federal funds rate is well under way.  Again, I agree with all elements of that strategy.

our normalization process that I support is keeping management focus of policy actions and communications rate.  That implies that we should incorporate explicitly as part of our normalization statement that the stance of monetary policy will primarily be conveyed the range for the federal funds rate.  At the same time, of course, we Another key element of of the balance sheet in the background, with the squarely on the funds policy through adjustments in

So I agree of reserves that we're going leaves open options for before we start reducing the balance sheet, there clarifying our views on the ultimate size of the balance sheet and our than later.  So if we agree that we plan on continuing with a communications should be forthright on that view even if we don't today or in the near future the precise expected future level of reserves.  In that case, I language.  I don't know why we're afraid of saying 'floor think people in the markets actually understand what that means, so my suggestion is level will be sufficient to maintain the federal funds rate close to the target level without regular open market operations.'  And I would just describe that as a floor system.  I it's simple-people will understand that. Of course, at some point, we will need to decide on the level to hold in the long run, and the current policy normalization statement this choice of post-normalization operating procedure and the level of reserves.  And although these decisions don't have to be made today or are some advantages to operating procedures sooner rather floor system, I think our specify actually would prefer even simpler system.'

the phasing out arguments for doing that, it may be a little bit of a further than a lot of people in the markets this has some risk of the potential negative effects of this, but I think 12 months would be plenty of time to Now, let me turn to some of the operational details.  Although I support of reinvestments and I understand the 'dovish' action by going out 18 months, which is expect.  This is going as slowly as we could possibly imagine, and I think communicating excessive trepidation on our part regarding normalization.  Remember, it took us only 10 months to do the taper back in 2014.  Again, I'm not going to argue forcefully against

I prefer having the adjustments to the amounts of the principal payments established up front and not think the proposed language is really good on this point. We should structure schedule of decided in a successive FOMC meeting unless, again, we have a fundamental change in the economic outlook.  So, again, I

think that the caps are a much better solution to the problem.  Some of the earlier This is quite simple, and I agree with everybody treatment of agency MBS and Treasury securities, which I that easy to explain.  And it makes sense for the reasons that are in the memo. I versions of this were remarkably complicated. who says it's really easy to explain.

Once we commence the the economic outlook materially deteriorates and we begin reducing the its long-run level would I want us to consider restarting or increasing reinvestments.  That is, we should reserve our interest a high level of commitment to whatever plan we opt for, and I do have some about that plan.  So let me address the questions posed for discussion.  First, on I would like preferences

May 2-3, 2017

reinvestments versus ceasing, my preference would be for ceasing reinvestments our normalization principles say we intend to reduce the size and predictable manner.  We've made no commitment to use a reinvestments.  Given the pattern of redemptions, cessation is consistent with a The staff memos from our earlier discussion indicate that difference in the macroeconomic effect, and that the markets and Treasury can redemption pattern regarding Treasury security holdings are known. phasing out with little or no phaseout.  Note that of the balance sheet in a gradual phaseout of gradual reduction in our balance sheet. there's little handle the pattern of redemptions this would entail.  I note that the Treasury securities is certain because our redemptions, one could cap on Treasury securities that would remain in place as redemptions proceeded.  An cessation is if one thought it would more likely engender a reassessment of create the next that drew on Stein persuasive.  In the period leading up to the mid-2013 tantrum, the median expectation about the timing of commencement of tapering aligned interest rates the market comprised agents about the timing of tapering.  Those who held a strong belief that easing would continue and tapering be delayed would have been surprised by the communication and would have unwound their trades, leading to a spike in interest This means that in assessing the probability of market reactions to policy communications, If one wanted to smooth out the pattern of Treasury security introduce a argument against market expectations about the speed of withdrawal of accommodation-that is, taper tantrum.  I found Governor Fischer's recent speech about market expectations remarks of former Governor Jeremy taper with Chairman Bernanke's communications.  Nonetheless, there was a sharp rise in after the Chairman spoke.  Such a reaction might have occurred if with firmly held beliefs quantitative Chairman's rates. one needs to know not only the dispersion of beliefs across participants, but also the degree of uncertainty for each individual participant.  There's considerable dispersion across participants,

May 2-3, 2017

could be a sharp market reaction to a policy announcement that didn't being equal. but individual participants have firmly held beliefs and little uncertainty.  This would imply a high likelihood there confirm those beliefs, all else recent surveys of market participants that the beliefs of individual participants are fairly diffuse.  They assign a positive outcomes.  This would tend to lower the likelihood of a taper time around, but it doesn't rule it out.  But communicating the details of our plan As Governor Fischer indicated in his speech, the show probability to a fairly wide range of tantrum this early, before implementation, and giving guidance about the timing of implementation will important in reducing this risk.

has little disadvantage over phaseout, does it have any advantages?  I see a clearer to communicate.  It would make clear our commitment to size of the balance sheet, and this will help allay political concerns about the use of It would send a clearer signal of our confidence that the economy has returned to help underscore the point that we view short-term interest rates as our tool, with the balance sheet reserved for extraordinary times of economic and believe we can appropriately commit to the phaseout plan.  The slower communications conundrum-having raising the amount of assets it lets run off its balance sheet.  It might be to keep a commitment to the reinvestment plan in this circumstance. If cessation few.  I think it would be reducing the this tool. normal times.  It would main policy financial stress.  I don't the phaseout, the more likely the Committee could face a to lower rates while it is very hard revised proposal are somewhat easier to communicate than the market participants who are the main audience for this could handle Now, while I prefer cessation, should the Committee decide a phaseout plan is preferable, I believe that dollar caps in the first proposal, although

May 2-3, 2017

for a shorter phaseout period under either proposal and therefore higher either.  I would argue caps.

argument for phaseout over cessation is that it aligns better with market taper tantrum, then one should align the phaseout market expectations, too.  The May surveys of primary dealers and market participants a 12-month phaseout.  So why not confirm their expectations Also, why not simplify and have equal caps on runoffs of Treasury seems there's little to be gained with separate caps.  And I may not even be needed, because, as market rates rise, If the expectations and so is less likely to engender a period of indicate market participants expect with a less timid plan? securities and agency securities?  It note that the cap on MBS runoffs prepayments-and therefore redemptions-fall.

So I'd opt for the second version of the second bullet we do have a further discussion and come to agreement. Regarding the proposed amendments to the normalization principles, because the Committee really hasn't premature point unless idea that we're reinvestment phaseout plan.  It suggests we'll be adjusting the reinvestment subsequent meetings as economic and financial conditions change.  This seems counter to background, so I'd drop this.  I don't think it's needed, the current version of the principles indicates that 'the Committee is prepared to adjust approach to policy normalization in light of economic and financial I prefer that we keep this, as it applies more generally and doesn't point to the The last bullet point in the phaseout version seems to run counter to the committing to the plan at the reinvestment plan running in the because the details of its developments.' reinvestments per se .

the staff memo did not indicate whether the FOMC statement will continue to the plan is implemented.  I'd opt for not including such a of a plan.

interest rate normalization later.  I we should have normalized the yield curve effects-the 'twist' effects on the yield rhetoric.  We didn't go MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I've long argued that we should normalize monetary policy through balance sheet normalization first and thought that curve that we got through balance sheet policy, at least according to our

think is pretty easy or as easy as it the height of the crisis, whereas we're proceeding with interest rate normalization think this is, in my mind, not sheet.  In going. that way, and now I think we have some contradictions in how we're approaching policy.  I that, to an outsider, it looks like the balance sheet part of the policy was even at and telling everyone that the economy is getting better.  And I ideal.  This is why I've been an advocate of getting going on normalizing the balance my view, we're way behind schedule on this, so I do think we should get the revised proposal is reasonable, and I appreciate the staff efforts to put this how cautious this is.  This is quite cautious-maybe excessively it's a very cautious proposal and almost nothing happens during the early ending the reinvestment policy, I think we could actually move ahead with this quite think it could be implemented right now without because almost nothing happens initially. I do think together.  I am struck by cautious.  Because months of quickly, perhaps during the summer.  Frankly, I much effect

taper and the worry that we might induce a taper me give you 'Jim's view of the taper tantrum,' which is that I would like to Committee that we actually did nothing in terms of tangible action in June 2013, nor any tangible action in September 2013.  The actual taper began only in December entire taper There's been talk here about the tantrum.  So let remind the did we take 2013, and, at that point, there was no ripple in global financial markets.  In fact, the went on without incident, in my view.

the time of June 2013 was all about communication and all about markets because they didn't realize what the Committee was thinking. remind the Committee that the decision that day was to do nothing with the the Chairman out to give a press conference that would explain how we in retrospect, because What was happening at the unexpected effect on And I'd just statement but to send were going to approach the taper.  I think that didn't work out very well

has to be realistic that we're probably going to future.  The policy rate probably will be point of another recession.  Recessions, I'm sure, have not least be able to entertain a at that juncture.  So, in my opinion, we should be doing to create the policy space now by shrinking the size of the balance sheet during relatively This proposal is okay, but it's generally extremely slow from the perspective of in future recession states.  So I would be open to wouldn't do that now-we're trying to get the way-but it may be something that we want to consider further down the road. On a broader point, I think the Committee have to consider quantitative easing at some point in the driven back to the zero bound at the gone away.  So there will be one at some point in the future.  And, in my opinion, we should be doing more to create the policy space that we're going to need to at possible quantitative easing program more good times. creating a better optionality for the Committee considering ways to speed this up in the future.

YELLEN.  Okay.  Thank you.  Acting President Gooding. CHAIR

Thank you.  I support the staff's proposal to use increasing caps over balance sheet.  Phasing out reinvestment seems approach to managing potential risk related to market function.  The proposed plan will maximum control over the pace of balance sheet shrinkage while also being gradual to the plan used to taper purchases at the end of the most LSAP.  For all of these reasons, the plan should allow for clear communication to, and MS. GOODING. an 18-month period to begin normalization of the a prudent allow for and predictable.

I also support what seems to be the rough consensus of the Committee that beginning a phaseout of In other words, the default right now, in my mind, is to begin, absent a outlook.  I do not support formally tying the beginning of the federal like to see the Committee communicate its is reasonably certain that beginning the phaseout is likely to occur within laying out its specific plans for way. As an overarching principle, I would intentions as soon as it the next 12 months.

Then, when we announce it, I would to three-month timetable telling the market we will start two to three moment.

I'm comfortable with point that suggests if there is a change in economic conditions, we might that deterioration, not just a deterioration.

May 2-3, 2017

my SEP submission has been based on the assumption that we begin the this year.  So my base case of three funds runoff subsumed in it, and I assumed that it would be done my path of rates, so I agree with comments that the timing of our start of the the balance sheet run off from a federal funds increase.  While I'd like that commit to a so-called pause, because, especially plan, I believe it overstates in the mind of the market the effect of ceasing reinvestments effect on the level of accommodation.  I think if this plan is done as has been expressed, I that we could do it in a way that materially limits the effect on those two my comments.  Thank you, Madam Chair. Stepping back, alluding to something that Governor Brainard talked about earlier, I would also say that process of letting the balance sheet run off sometime rate increases has that balance sheet gradually.  That's what I've always assumed for have been made that we may want to have the option to separate process of letting option, I want to make sure we don't promise or with this and the would actually hope markets.  And those are

YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  President Harker. CHAIR

the basic factors I see influencing the timing of normalization involve the level of the state of the economy relative to our goals, and the balance of risks facing the I would anticipate beginning the normalization process after one or, preferably, also do not want to explicitly tie the timing of normalization to the level of rate.  I can also envision conditions evolving in a way that would make it desirable to later this year.  This would imply the need for some form of communication MR. HARKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As I mentioned in our previous go-round on this topic, funds rate, the economy.  While two more rate hikes, I the funds start normalization in June, as others have discussed previously.

Although my modal forecast is that normalization will have only small effects on yields and market functioning, I do have concerns about the uncertainty surrounding that view.  For that

I and the willingness of the staff to listen to some of the and revise the original proposal. reason, I do prefer tapered.  That tapering can be more also appreciate the work by the staff feedback they do seem to me to be a little bit start at $10 billion or $15 billion and work our way up to $40 billion or there would likely be operational problems with this larger well functioning, and $40 billion to $50 billion does not like a large amount relative to overall Treasury security issuance. Regarding the caps on Treasury securities, conservative.  We could $50 billion unless the Desk indicates cap.  The Treasury securities market is seem

of the simpler plan seems rather straightforward, especially in view of target audience.  I will, however, defer to the Desk on this issue, as they the possible risks of a larger cap, larger cap would, I hope, accelerate the process a little bit, which I think is a helpful Communication the sophistication of the have the pulse of the market participants and understand although the thing, as some others have mentioned.

roughly those I expect to prevail anticipate the funds rate could be in the target range of First, communication would need to be carefully crafted to a trigger.  Second, a tie-in between the level of the funds rate and the start of on what should be mundane 25 basis point increases.  It me to rely on data-contingent language in a manner analogous to that regard, I am in favor of communicating through the To reiterate, the conditions for starting normalization are close to the end of this year, when I 125 to 150 basis points.  As I indicated, I do not favor explicitly linking the level of the funds rate with the start of normalization. avoid confusion over whether the level of the federal funds rate that starts normalization is a threshold or normalization would raise the stakes seems preferable to deployed for the federal funds rate.  In that

briefing.  As indicated, a more detailed explanation could be confusion. release of additional bullets that summarize operational plans, with information being fleshed out in the Chair's June press subsequently issued by the Desk, guaranteeing minimal market in favor of releasing the likely timing of normalization in the bullets as well as in of the basic information in one place.  But it deserves to be included in the statement as well. draft language on page 3 of the memo to be quite well done and strongly prefer the the 'or'-that is, the simpler language.  The first alternative, in my mind, to using a floor, and I want to come back minute.  The second alternative is clear and concise.  The last paragraph does the job contingent, which, due to the uncertainty I alluded to earlier to what happened during the taper tantrum.  My disagreement is with the overly conservative approach taken with respect to the caps on they could be higher. I'm also the FOMC statement.  Doing so would place all because this is an important change in policy, I found the second paragraph after goes into too much detail and commits the Committee to that in a of making normalization policy state in my remarks, makes, in my mind, perfect policy sense.  I believe that communication along these lines will help avoid occurrences similar only Treasury securities and the question of whether

proposed change to paragraph 5 of the statement seems well thought out and appropriate for the June policy statement.  But I also agree with some others the announcement of the phaseout should not be at a meeting at which we're also raising the Vice Chairman Dudley said, makes some Finally, the may very well be that federal funds rate.  I think separating those two, as sense.

I'd like to raise one additional issue that the Committee needs to come to grips with, up operating in a floor system or a corridor system.  Now, preliminary Philadelphia Federal Reserve-and I really do want to emphasize 'preliminary'But and it's whether we end work at the

Afonso, Armenter, and Lester finds that in the current institutional in the corridor with as much as $1 If further work bears out these initial estimates, a corridor system the operational costs associated with a very small quantity of reserves, and, in might favor a corridor system. drawing on a recent model of environment, we could see ourselves operating firmly in a corridor with somewhere neighborhood of $400 billion in reserves and could possibly enter a trillion in excess reserves. would not suffer that case, political economy considerations is very preliminary work.  But the reason I raise it-and they're going to this area-is that it implies to me that we should be careful about saying, in that we're going to be using a floor system, because we may not.  We want to use a floor system, but it may be that we'd actually be in a corridor system, to correct, under the level of reserves we're talking about. the simpler language rather than trying to explain I'm not sure we necessarily need to state it publicly.  Thank you, Madam Again, this continue research in any statement we make, may say we if some of this work is even close And that's another reason I would prefer whether we're going to be using a corridor or a floor system.  We will know that as we reduce the reserves over time. Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Acting President Mullinix. CHAIR

most important to me is that our actions with regard communicated, predictable, and, to the extent possible, divorced Williams put it. MR. MULLINIX.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Let me preface my comments on the staff's questions by saying that what seems to the balance sheet be well from the path of interest rates-or in the background, as Presidents Mester and along the upward path we currently expect, it the economic differences between different approaches to winding down Accordingly, with regard to the first question, I would be comfortable Assuming that interest rates continue appears that reinvestment are small.

communicating the phaseout in a statement of this spirit, I also the phaseout will commence in October at the September With regard to the second question, on communications, I can see the case for an abundance of caution, which would warrant principles and plans in the June press conference before we actually begin.  In believe, Madam Chair, announcing that press conference seems to be a reasonable approach, assuming, of course, economic conditions continue to warrant it.  Thank you.

conditions under which the balance would start to be reduced in paragraph 5 of our June statement and issuing a statement of and plans for balance sheet normalization at the June FOMC meeting.  Let me take MS. BRAINARD.  I support communicating the sheet principles each in turn.

I prefer an approach that clearly and directly implements the statement language then.  Under this clarify the level of the federal funds rate that it way.  This approach clearly ties federal funds rate, and thereby to today. First, that was introduced in December 2015 and has remained in the statement since approach, the Committee would simply need to views as being consistent with normalization being well under the commencement of phasing out reinvestment to the economic conditions, rather than reintroducing time-contingent language, which has created challenges for us in the past and I view as unnecessary way' threshold was to ensure that our most adverse shocks and thus help guard against the asymmetric risks associated with the The original intention of the 'well under proven tool, the federal funds rate, will have reached a level at which it can be cut, if needed, to buffer

May 2-3, 2017

At the time the language was discussed, the staff analysis suggested a 2 percent, which was midway to the SEP median of the longer-run value of the at that time.  Since we originally introduced that language, the SEP median of the federal funds rate has fallen to around 3 percent currently.  With would seem simple, elegant, and economically compelling the 'well under way' threshold as being effective lower bound. threshold of federal funds rate the longer-run value of 3 percent as the longer-run value, it for the Committee simply to clarify that it views midway to its longer-run equilibrium value.

to the statement language along the following Committee intends to commence phasing out reinvestments once normalization of is well under way, after the target range for the federal funds The Chair this the meeting or press conference target for the federal funds rate has reached that range, which could be as soon evolve in line with the median SEP number.  At the rate is raised to that threshold, the statement could simply the Committee now judges that normalization is well under way-thus paving the well-communicated change in reinvestment policy to commence at the meeting or press conference meeting. Thus, I would prefer a simple amendment lines:  'The the level of the federal funds rate rate reaches 1¼ to 1½ percent, midway to the expected longer-run federal funds rate.' could further clarify in the June press conference that, under the SEP median estimate, would mean commencing the phaseout of reinvestment at meeting after the as September if economic conditions meeting when the federal funds acknowledge that the way for subsequent this matter, there has been some confusion as to whether the Committee would put adjust the federal funds rate at the meeting at which it commences the On adjustments in the federal funds rate on pause for some time during which the phasing out of balance sheet reinvestment gets under way.  It would be prudent to clarify the Committee's expectation that it will not

May 2-3, 2017

of reinvestment, out of an abundance of caution, but that this would apply only to the in balance sheet policy and not any subsequent meetings. phaseout initial change regard to the statement of principles and plans, it's important to make clear that the sheet will, in general, be subordinate to the federal funds rate.  So I support our clearly the target range for the federal funds rate as its of this approach when the two tools are largely substitutes With balance stating that the Committee will use changes in primary means for adjusting the stance of monetary policy.  Predictability, precision, and clarity of communications all argue in favor for one another.

likely to trigger an adverse market liquidity challenges, because it would gradually and amount of securities the market will be required to absorb each month appealing symmetry in relation to the predictable dollar process, as noted by President Rosengren.  I appreciate the approach that avoids spikes inclined to apply the change in our across Treasury securities and MBS as proposed. Second, I like the approach that would cap monthly redemptions at a gradually increasing level over an 18-month period.  In my view, this approach is the least market reaction or encounter predictably increase the while avoiding spikes.  It also has an approach taken during the purchase staff's effort to respond to our request for a predictable and gradual and is easier to communicate.  In addition, I'd be reinvestment policy symmetrically framework that will the balance sheet once it reaches its 'new normal.'  The Committee's suggest there is substantial support for maintaining the current floor framework for especially because of its greater relative this clearly in the normalization plans and principles.  Of course, that will Next, it's important for the principles to set expectations about the govern the size of deliberations establishing the System's short-term interest rate target, simplicity, and I favor stating it's difficult to know with precision in advance the minimum level of reserves

May 2-3, 2017

in a floor system.  Ultimately, the the 'new any further reduction in the on money market rates as the balance sheet efficiently and effectively implement monetary policy Committee is likely to have to gauge the appropriate supply of excess reserves in normal' by relying on monitoring money markets for indications that supply of reserves would put upward pressure gradually declines.

to the federal funds rate will be our indicate that there will be circumstances when we may the economy encounters material adverse shocks, it may be to commence the reinvestment of principal payments again in order to preserve prepared to use its full tools if future conditions warrant a more accommodative stance of policy than can be rate alone.  Informing markets of our intentions in Finally, while subordination of the balance sheet baseline policy, it's also important to need to rely on the balance sheet more actively.  During the period when the balance sheet is running down, for instance, if appropriate conventional policy space.  I support stating clearly that the Committee is range of achieved through the use of the federal funds this regard could promote stability and resilience in the economy.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  President George. CHAIR

reinvestments the normalization process.  I do think there's scope to consider a shorter survey of dealers and market in which those expectations seem to be more in the one-year time frame. MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I, too, support phasing out along the lines of the revised staff proposal, with the sequence of increasing caps and redemptions throughout phaseout horizon than 18 months-again, on the basis of the Desk participants, the timing of this, I favor starting the phaseout process this year and support the detailed information as outlined in the draft refresh of the Committee's to be coalescing around some announcement in the In terms of releasing communications.  Market expectations seem

May 2-3, 2017

the reinvestment policy, and communicating relatively soon approach seems appropriate.  So I support the idea of releasing the normalization course, using the minutes for additional context regarding these fourth quarter of this year regarding about the principles with new bullets along with the statement and having the Chair speak to this at the press conference and, of discussions today.

it's also important to communicate about this issue of the interaction between the sheet normalization, and I liked Governor Brainard's proposal about using June.  In terms of the proposed to address the as how to determine the appropriate the ON RRP facility.  Understanding that many participants did see to foreshadow that direction, though, in our communications until we have an explicit long-run framework and thinking about the implications for its future use.  For I prefer the third that second one, which reiterated that reductions of our securities holdings and levels 'no larger than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently I think funds rate and balance the SEP, perhaps, to think about how to explain that more in communications about reinvestment, I agree that at some point we'll need longer-run size and composition of the balance sheet as well timing of phaseout of advantages for a floor system when we talked about a long-run framework, I still think it's premature decision about the that reason, as we release new bullets augmenting the normalization principles, bullet over reserves would be to and effectively.'

last bullet that reinvestments will resume only if the funds rate is again constrained by the effective lower bound.  This approach to the principle of using the tools we understand best to their fullest extent before tools and conforms to the message we sent in the minutes of the November Also, I would favor stating in the target for the federal adheres implementing other

with these caps.  At first, I liked more I thought about them, the less excited I got about them, and here's why.  First, market.  The Treasury will know when these refundings are due.  It can prefund.  I see a market-functioning issue arising unless the U.S. government is running huge budget the Treasury's problem, not our problem, to deal with.  Second, it's not like is literally the bond just coming due on schedule, so I don't And, by the way, there safe assets, so I further don't see this as being a market, the only way this is a problem is if rates drop a real problem that we're going to have in either securities market.  The best argument I have for caps or a is just a psychological one-that maybe, on the margin, it's less likely to trigger some good enough reason to do it, but, just hearing we need to have these caps. MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I struggle them.  The substantively, I can't figure out why we need them.  I think about Lorie's explanation about the Treasury don't deficits-which is we're selling off our portfolio.  This really see how the caps are necessary for the Treasury securities market. are lots of professors saying the world is short of problem.  If you take the MBS side of the and then people refinance quickly.  But we've already said that if rates drop, we may suspend this program anyway.  So I don't feel like this is the MBS market or the Treasury phaseout form of a taper tantrum.  And that may well be a the arguments, I don't see a technical reason why the specific questions, I would prefer a slightly shorter phaseout-12 months don't feel strongly about this. In terms of rather than 18-though I

putting out something in June because the most important thing we can do is markets as much advance warning as possible so there are no surprises.  And I would say I do support to give

some form of an operational memo, I would encourage that it's ready, rather than delaying it. that if the Desk is going to put out sooner, maybe even in June if idea of making this date based.  I agree with President Williams and others. right to me.  It gives markets plenty of advance warning.  I don't like the a federal funds rate hike, because that, then, becomes a momentous move, as I like the Around year-end feels idea of tying it to opposed to just putting this in the background and letting it take its own course.

I also agree with President Williams that if we're going to call it a floor system, floor system.  When I saw 'autonomous factors,' it raised all sorts of questions mean?  Oh, it means a floor system.'  Why don't we just call it a Lastly, let's just call it a in my mind:  'What does this floor system?  Thank you.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Vice Chairman.

DUDLEY.  I went at the beginning, and I've been listening to all of I said in my remarks that I was more in favor of an than 12 months because I want to minimize the risk of market disruption. 12-month was sufficiently good.  I to make in favor of 12 months, so I'm going to make them, everyone else said.  The first reason is that you're not really fully phased are caps in place beyond that.  So in some ways, it's 12 months is that you could end up with If you did MBS starting with 4, you go 4, than the 21 and 35 that seem to be very arbitrary.  It would that we had whole numbers, and we had seven increments, so that's VICE CHAIRMAN this discussion.  I had just one comment. 18-month phaseout But I heard that a lot of people around the table thought the think there are a couple of points having listened to what out even after 12 months, because there really 12 months plus.  The second advantage of rounder numbers.  I just did this back-of-the-envelope: 8, 12, 16, and 20, and, for Treasury securities, you go 18, 16, 24, 32, and 40.  To me, 40 and 20 feel sort of like more round numbers be hard to explain to people

May 2-3, 2017

21 and 35.  So I think I'd be open minded about going to 12 months the market probably than $35 billion in Treasury securities a month, provided that there is enough for the U.S. Treasury to adjust its debt management program.  So I think that's a potential why we ended up with the with that kind of program.  It also addresses President Harker's point that could absorb more time alternative.

Thank you for a very good discussion.  I heard, I believe, for the idea that we should try to issue a set of bullets on our are a couple of things that are important that we and come back with a proposal.  Also, the bullet that essentially we'll use a floor system-although I heard considerable support for going to a floor system, also heard some reservations about announcing that now.  So I think we'll need to sit down and what the best approach is and come back to you in a timely fashion.  Maybe we'll to make sure we can converge on what these bullets look like meeting.  We'll try to sort that out, but I did hear quite a bit of support for the general staff has recommended and for issuing these bullets. CHAIR YELLEN.  Agreed. unanimous support around the table approach that we would discuss.  Clearly, there need to work out between now and the June meeting to make sure we can agree on the bullets.  I think the issue of how long the phaseout period is, which many of you mentioned, is something we need to talk to the staff about says I think about need some back-and-forth in order in the June sort of approach that the

I think that concludes our discussion of reinvestment policy.  We items to cover.  First, I want to confirm that our next meeting CHAIR YELLEN. have just a couple of administrative will be Tuesday and Wednesday, June 13 and 14.
