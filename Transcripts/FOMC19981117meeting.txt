MS. RIVLIN.  Is  applause ppropriate? a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes. [Applause]  Who  would like  o  move to  approve t the  minutes  of he eptember  29  meeting? t S

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. So move.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without  objection.  s you  know,  in  two  or hree f ur A t o o recent  eetings,  e have  been  contemplating  ays to mprove  a  number of he rocedures  hat m w w i t p t we use  to  communicate  to he ublic.  e  seem  to ave  reached   consensus round his  able t p W h a a t t that  he ording  in  the perational  ragraph f he irective quires  ome revision.   have t w o pa o t d re s We considered    number of ifferent  rsions, d  at his  oint    will all  n  David  Lindsey o a d ve an t p I c o t introduce  oday's  iscussion   describing  he tate  f lay  at he oment. t d by t s o p t m

MR.  LINDSEY. Mr.  Chairman,  beginning  n page  15 in he luebook  for oday's o t B t meeting,  e list ree  ptions  or ommittee  consideration.  tion  1  is he raditional guage. w h o f C Op t t lan Option  2,  which  was  included  n   memorandum  that    wrote  to he ommittee in arly i a I t C e November,  reflects e  revisions at resident  oenig  suggested  t  the eptember  meeting. th th P H a S There  are  optional  nclusions  ome  "furthers"    options    and  3 that  he ommittee may i ofs in 2 t C

wish  to onsider.  he purpose f he  latter  o ick p  the ossibility t  fter  he  Committee c T o t ist p u p ha a t has  moved at  a  meeting,  t  ay wish  to eflect  at  act  n  the ording  of he ilt  ntence.    have i m r th f i w t t se I indicated   the ote  on  page  16 of he luebook  how some presidents d  one  Board  member in n t B an have  reacted  o he roposed ddition  f  a  sentence  n  Option  2 concerning  otential justments t t p a o i p ad to  policy  uring n  intermeeting riod.    think    should urn he iscussion  f  Option  3 over o d a pe I I t t d o t President nehan,  since t s er  proposal. Mi i i h

MS. MINEHAN. I  would  like  o  apologize  o veryone ecause   really  idn't an t t e b I d me to  complicate  eedlessly  r  in ny  event o xtend he iscussion   yet nother lternative. n o a t e t d to a a What I  thought    was doing  in esponding  o he equest  or  ossible  ewording as to  include I r t t r f p r w a reference  o  the  balance f isks  n  the  paragraph. n the asis f y notes t he eptember t o r i O b o m a t S meeting,  hat  as an  idea hat  om  Hoenig  brought p and  that  ost  of he embers appeared o t w t T u m t m t endorse. t  least  hat  s hat  my notes ay.  In  any  event,  he nclusion   a  reference  o he A t i w s t i of t t Committee's iew  of  the  balance f isks  s he ajor  difference   my alternative. v o r i t m in

I  differentiate  ween  the tilt"  d  the no  tilt"  nguage. n  the no  tilt"  nguage, bet " an " la I " la there  s n  explicit  ference  o  the ommittee's erception  f isks  s  being alanced t east  or i a re t C p o r a b a l f the ntermeeting riod nd  a  related lief at  o change  or  a  slight ward or  downward move i pe a be th n up might  be  equally  ikely.  n  the tilt"  nguage,  he erceived  alance f  risks  s ot xplicitly l I " la t p b o i n e mentioned  but  is mplicit  he  Committee's doption f  an  upside  or  a  downside  tilt. so, i int a o Al I would  agree ith  Presidents ehne and  Parry nd  with  Governor  Kelley ith  regard o  the w Bo a w t desirability ropping he  next  to ast  entence n  Option  2  that tarts th  "Any potential of  d t l s i s wi changes...."  on't  hink t  s eeded.  I on't  ave  any  pride f  authorship, t   do  have  some I  d t i i n d h o bu I warm  and  fuzzy  feeling r he  idea f entioning he  balance f isks  n  the irective. fo t o m t o r i d

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I  never eard nybody  talk  bout isks  s  "warm and h a a r a fuzzy."  [Laughter]  President  ordan. J

MR.  JORDAN. Cathy, our  alternative  rding  for   tilt   he irective  fers  o y wo a int d re t economic,  financial,  d  monetary  developments;  hat  s ine. ption  2  talks  bout rospective an t i f O a p developments,  ilt   no  tilt;  at  s ine s  well.   am agreeable  o  talking  bout isks, t our t or th i f a I t a r bu y "no  tilt"  ntence  efers  o  "risks  o he conomic  outlook." hat  stopped e because t  ould e se r t t t e T m i c b interpreted   ean real rowth  rather  han  "economic, inancial,  d  monetary  developments." tom g t f an As we saw very  recently, ariety  f  near-term  isks  ay cause he  Committee  to  do  something a  v o r m t that  ay not  translate    the iew  of very utsider  s  pertaining   the conomic  outlook. m in v e o a to e

MS. MINEHAN. My  intention s  that he  reference  o  the conomic  outlook  ould wa t t e w be  modified y  the ubsequent  hrase bout  changes  in  "economic, inancial,  d  monetary b s p a f an conditions"   that he wo expressions  ould  be  considered  o  be  equivalent   the ontext  f so t t w t in c o that entence.  ut  I  see  the roblem  that  ou're  alking  bout. s B p y t a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chairman.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr.  Chairman,   understand  he ogic f ption I t l o O 3,  but  when we talk  bout isks  o he  forecast,   are ngaging n  internal dspeak.  Jerry a r t t we e i Fe Jordan as  picked p  on  the oncern   would  have  about  mentioning isks  n  this  ontext, mely h u c I r i c na that  he verage  American  would  conclude hat  e thought  conomic  growth  was a  risky hing. t a t w e t In  popular  se, t  s   word  that  ould et s  into ome trouble.  o,  I  end  up  being  very u i i a c g u s S comfortable  ith  the lternative  nguage f  Option  2. With some amendments from  Tom w a la o Hoenig  to he  earlier rsion,  hat  ption aptures  hat  we found  reasonable  t  the ast  eeting. t ve t o c w a l m I believe  hat ven  when we have  no  tilt, need  the  disputed  entence, ny  potential  anges  in t e we s "a ch the  federal  unds ate  perating  bjective ring he  intermeeting riod hould e  considered f r o o du t pe s b in

that  ontext." hat  sentence  akes it  learer  hat  he hairman  has  the  power--in act  here  s o c T m c t t C f t i n question  bout  that  n  my  view--and he ood  will f  his olleagues  n  the  Committee  so  that  f a i t g o c o i circumstances  n  the ntermeeting riod hould ndicate e  desirability   change  in  policy, i i pe s i th of  a he can  implement  the  change.  The courtesy  hat  ou  have  shown us, r.  Chairman,  at  least  n  the t y M i 5-1/2 years hat 've  een  sitting  re,  as  been  such  that    don't  hink  here's  e lightest  rry t I b he h I t t th s wo that  hat  ower  would  not  be  used isely nd  well.  So,  I  think t's  ry mportant  hat  he t p w a i ve i t t sentence  n uestion  e  retained. i q b

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  roaddus. B

MR. BROADDUS. Mr.  Chairman,  I  think hat  ither tion  2  or  Option  3  would  be  a t e Op significant  provement  over hat  we have  now.  For he  reasons  hat  erry ordan entioned, im w t t J J m I would have  a  preference  or  ption  2. In  my  view, t  s   little  re compact  and  a  little  earer. f O i i a mo cl I  would  agree ith  those ho feel hat  e should emove the hird  entence. f e do so, w w t w r t s I w I would suggest   change  at he  end  of  the receding  entence.  here there  s   reference  o  "the a t p s W i a t federal  unds  rate  n oming  months,"  ould  prefer  o  see  the ords  "in  coming  months" f i c Iw t w changed  to  "in he ntermeeting riod." hat  would  make the  period hat  e are  talking  bout t i pe T t w a a little  re explicit  d  definite. nally,   e can  get  the anguage hanged,  ope  we will hen mo an Fi if w l c Ih t move on  to  the ext nd  I  think  qually  ritical  estion  f hether  or ot e will elease  his n a e c qu o w n w r t information  o  the ublic hortly  fter  he eeting  at hich  the irective   et. t p s a t m w d iss

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  oehne. B

MR.  BOEHNE. I  prefer  ption  2. In  my  view, t  aptures  hat  we have  been  talking O i c w about  around  the able.    would drop  the entence eginning  ith  "Any potential anges."  My t I s b w ch only  reason or uggesting  ts  eletion  s hat    think  t  s asically dundant,  hough t  s f s i d i t I i i b re t i i substantively  rmless. e  need  to ave  a  Chairman who is ully  ffective. fully  ffective ha W h f e A e

Chairman  needs  to  be  able o  change  the ederal  unds  rate  etween  meetings. t f f b If dropping r o adding  this  entence  n  any  way affects at,  am for hichever trengthens e  Chairman's and s i th I w s th h to  be  fully  ffective. e

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  arry. P

MR.  PARRY. Mr.  Chairman,  I  prefer  ption  2, nd  I  would  like o emove  that hird O a t r t sentence  ecause , oo, elieve  t  s edundant.  It eems  to  me,  though, hat  oth  Options   and b I t b i i r s t b 2 3 are  a  tremendous  improvement  over he ording  we have  been  using n  recent  ears. t w i y

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  tem. S

MR. STERN. I  think  ption  2 would  be  a  distinct  provement  and  I  favor hat. O im t I think ropping hat entence  bout  "any  potential  anges" s  probably   good  idea ecause t d t s a ch i a b i seems  redundant  o  me,  but   don't  eel ery  strongly  bout t. t I f v a i

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Meyer.

MR. MEYER. I  want  to oin  hat  seems  to e  the merging  consensus. ,  oo,  refer j w b e I t p Option  2,  and  I  would  eliminate e  sentence  n  question.    don't  hink  t  dds  anything, d th i I t i a an whatever  is riefer d  more to he oint s etter.    also ould  echo  the iew  that  t  ould  be b an t p i b I w v i w desirable r s  to ove at  some point o  the mmediate  release  f his  anguage fter  ur fo u m t i o t l a o meetings. hank you. T

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Rivlin.

MS. RIVLIN.  I, oo, fter  hinking  athy  Minehan was on  the ight  rack,  back  to t a t C r t am Option  2  because t  s impler.  he subtleties   he  sentence  hat  s nder  consideration  r i i s T oft t i u fo removal  had  escaped e,  so  I as  in  favor f aking  t  ut.   still  vor ropping t nless  here  s m w o t i o I fa d i u t i some subtlety  hat  an  and  should e  conveyed.  But  if  t s hat  ubtle, d  I  have  been  here -1/2 t c b i i t s an 2 years,  aybe it  eally  s nnecessary. m r i u

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Ferguson.

MR. FERGUSON. Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  ither  ption ould  be  an improvement e o w over  what  we currently ve, ut  I, oo,  ave  a  slight eference  or ption  2  mainly  because ha b t h pr f O I think ur  discussion out  risks  s ery nternally  cused. n the ther and,   hope  we will o ab i v i fo O o h I decide o  release  he irective d, herefore,  ould like  omething hat s  written  n  relatively t t d an t I  w s t i i plain nglish. n  my view, ption  2  does  that  uite  icely.  ith  respect  o  the  added  sentence, E I O q n W t I will ollow hat  I  think s he  emerging  consensus hat  t  e  dropped, hough  I  don't el trongly f w i t t i b t fe s about  that.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  oole. P

MR. POOLE. I  favor  ption  2,  and  I  agree hat  he entence bout any  potential O t t s a " changes"  does  not  add  to  the larity  he irective. new issue hat    would  like  o  raise c oft d A t I t relates   the ast  entence  f  the irective ncerning 2  and  M3.  I  would  hope  that  e would to l s o d co M w not  have  a  ritual pectation  lowing  monetary  growth  if  e do  not  in act  ave  such  an ex ofs w f h expectation.    think,  or xample, hat  lower rowth  probably as not ur  expectation  he I f e t s g w o int recent  ast.  So,  I  would  hope  that  f  e are oing o  have  this  entence  n  the irective, p i w g t s i d it actually  ill  eflect e udgment  of he  Committee  and  not e  just  itually  serted. w r th j t b r in

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Do you  mean that  ou would  refer  o  it  s  a  staff y t a forecast  s  distinct  om  a  Committee  statement? a fr

MR.  POOLE. Perhaps,  es. y

MR.  LINDSEY. We  actually re using onetary  growth  numbers  in  that entence we m s earlier. en  the  Committee  downgraded  the onetary  aggregates  urther   1993,  we changed Wh m f in the  wording  of hat  entence  o liminate e umbers and  include   qualitative  scription.  r t s t e th n a de Ou intent  lways  has  been  to  provide   qualitative cription  at  xactly  escribes  he taff  orecast a a des th e d t s f

over  coming months--not  lways  over  the ext onth or  two  but,  or xample, ver  the -month a n m f e o 6 horizon hat  s urrently   the  Bluebook.  Unfortunately,   1998 has  progressed  e have  been t i c in as w hit ith  continuing  pside urprises    relation   our  forecast.  o,  we have  been  somewhat w u s in to S embarrassed y  not  having  the lowdown that  e predicted. b s w

MR. POOLE. There  is   potential oblem  here.   agree ith  Al  Broaddus  that  he a pr I w t federal  unds  language hould efer  o  the ntermeeting riod,  ut  I  think t's  ear  hat  he f s r t i pe b i cl t t reference  o rowth  in  the onetary  aggregates  overs ore than he  intermeeting riod.  o, t g m c m t pe S we should ut  in  some language hat  as  a  longer orizon or he ggregates. p t h h f t a

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr.  Chairman, ould  I  explain  hy, unlike c w some others,    feel  s  I  do on  the ption  2  sentence  n uestion? I a O i q

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let's  irst nish  ur  discussion  f he oney supply f fi o o t m issue.  oes anybody  else ave  any  views  about ow to  handle hat  uestion? D h h t q

MR. MEYER. I  think  hat  resident ole  is ringing  p  an  extraordinarily  d t P Po b u goo point. t s lmost  an  embarrassment o  use  over nd  over   standard  entence  hat ncorporates I i a t a a s t i an  expectation at  an  only  sometimes  be  right.  f  e want  to  include  his  eference   the th c I w t r in directive,   should djust  t  o  reflect anges n  the  money growth  forecast. we a i t ch i

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Does anyone  have  any  further sights?   think  hat in I t raises    quite  nanswerable uestion, t  we do  have  to  resolve  t  ne  way or  another.  t  s a u q bu i o I i a problem  in  the  sense hat f  he ontemplated  eserve  onditions e  constantly anging ut  are t i t c r c ar ch b always  consistent  th  some moderation n he  growth  of 2, it trikes  that  e are mplying wi i t M s me w i a  good  deal ore about  the xtent f ur  knowledge  of ow the  system  is  working  than  evidently m e o o h is he  case. t

MR. LINDSEY. In  recent  emory, which  includes  he ast  ouple f  years,  e have m t l c o w altered  he ording  in  that  entence  o  say "consistent  th  moderate  growth  of 2  and  M3  in t w s t wi M coming months"  when we thought uch  growth  would  continue  o e  moderate.  While  actual s t b monetary  growth  has  been  strong  his  ear,  e have  had  a  persistent  aff recast  oderation t y w st o ofm in  the uture.  o,  the ording  of hat  entence his  ear as  continuously flected r  staff f S w t s t y h re ou forecast  f  moderating rowth. o g

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It urned ut  that  he entence  as wrong,  but hat t o t s w t wording  was not  locked n. i

MR. LINDSEY. Exactly. t s ot  locked  in.  It  ust  appens  to  describe  he taff I i n j h t s forecast  ver oming  months. o c

MS. MINEHAN. The choice hould  be  "moderate" r  "some moderation." s o

MR. LINDSEY. When  it  as  been  appropriate   terms f ur  forecast,   have  said h in o o we "moderate."

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I  think  resident nehan has  the ight  nswer. P Mi r a

MR. LINDSEY. That's    good  point.  t  meetings n  the uture, e ommittee  could a A i f th C choose  what  the xact ording  will e. The Committee  may want  to  do  that  enceforth. e w b h

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Is veryone  in  agreement hat hat  s dvisable? e t t i a SEVERAL. Yes.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice  Chair,  ou  have  the loor  n  the ther entence. y f o o s VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. I  just  anted  to larify  view  on  the any w c my " potential anges"  sentence nd  why it hould e  included  n  the  directive.  ose  who say  that  t ch a s b i Th i should ot  be  there  re  saying hat  t  s edundant,  nd  for s  around his  able  t  s edundant. n a t i i r a u t t i i r But  we are ot  the nly  audience. here  is   whole  world  out here illed th  Fed  watchers nd n o T a t f wi a

journalists.  firmly ersuaded hat,  owever  abnormal  it  ay appear,  hese utside  bservers I  am p t h m t o o would  read  the bsence f hat entence  ight  fter  n  intermeeting sing f he unds ate s  an a o t s r a a ea o t f r a indication at  he ederal pen Market  Committee decided o  take   power away from  the th t F O t a Chairman,  which  he  traditionally    had.  I  can  assure ou  that  hat's  w it  ould  be has y t ho w interpreted.  at  is ot  our  intent,  t  our ntent  ot ery  relevant. at  would  be  the ay it Th n bu i isn v Th w would  be  interpreted.   ould  involve s  in  a  big rouhaha bout  nothing. f  hose ho object Itw u b a I t w to  the entence  hink  t  s edundant, at's ery  small rice o ay  to  avert   highly  olitical s t i i r th a  v p t p a p event  that  ould  dismay  all f  us.  I  really courage s  not o o that. w o en u t d

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  oskow. M

MR. MOSKOW. I  agree ith  the onsensus o  go  with  Option  2.  I  think  he w c t t sentence  hat  resident Donough t P Mc is eferring    is edundant nd  unnecessary.    just nder r to r a I wo if  here  s ome other  ay to  deal ith  the roblem  that  ou  raise, ll, ich  is   real  roblem. t i s w w p y Bi wh a p We  might  put  out   statement  hen we notify  he ublic  bout ur uture  se  of ifferent a w t p a o f u d language n  which  we would  say  that  he ewording oes  not eflect  y  change  in ederal i t r d r an F Reserve  policies.   s ust  n  effort   clarify e eaning  of ur  directives.  at  in  fact  s It i j a to th m o Th i exactly  hat  we are  trying  o o. w t d

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. I  think uch  clarifications  d o et ost, d s ten t g l an this  roblem  would  be  perpetuated  eeting fter  eeting.  In  the ffort   eliminate  edundancy, p m a m e to r we really  ould  be  inviting  problem  that  e don't  eed  to  have. w a w n

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Would President  roaddus's  ecommendation  resolve B r this?  One possibility  o  combine  the  sentences  o ead n  part more likely  o  warrant a is t t r i " t [ further]  ncrease/decrease n  [a  further] crease/increase he ederal  unds ate n  the i tha de in  t f f r i

intermeeting riod" nstead  f  "in oming months."  It ight  be  an  interesting  of pe i o c m way combining  the  sentences.

MR.  FERGUSON. May  I  speak  to  that  oint,  r.  Chairman? I  may be  a  minority  f p M o one  in hinking  hat  our  suggested  evision  oesn't  what  we need  to  do.  Okay,  I  may be t t y r d do speaking or thers! s I  read ur  use  of he  tilt,   overs   longer  eriod han he pecific f o A o t itc a p t t s intermeeting riod. f  e collapse  he  two,  we will eave   false  mpression  hat  e are pe I w t l a i t w focusing nly  on the ntermeeting riod s  opposed  to  indicating  at  e may end  up  adjusting o i pe a th w policy  n  a  given irection er   longer eriod f ime. i d ov a p o t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Why  don't  e say  "in he  intermeeting riod nd  in w t pe a coming  months?" Would that  o it? d

MR.  FISHER.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  am  going o e  referring t b to  a  package  of olored harts  hat  ou should ind n  front  f  you.1/ My c c t y f i o report  oday  will e  in  two  parts.  irst, ill iscuss  arket  conditions d t b F I  w d m an review  domestic pen  market  operations,  swer  your  questions, d  seek o an an your  ratification ur  open  market  operations.  fter  hat  ote,    will  eek of  o A t v I s your  approval n  the  two special tters dentified   he  revised  genda. o ma i int a

Turning  to  the irst  ge  of olored  harts, e op anel  shows  forward f pa c c th t p rate greements n  red or he nited  States.  hile  the orward ates  ave a i f t U W f r h backed  up  from  the ows  they eached n ate  ctober,  oth  the -month l r i l O b 3 forward nd  the  9-month  forward -month  rates re till  ading  elow  5 a 3 a s tr b percent.  he 9-month  forward ate  s  still  ading  lightly  low  the T r i tr s be 3-month  forward ate. his ertainly ntinues  o  suggest    decidedly r T c co t a downward slope o  interest  te  xpectations re n  the nited  States. t ra e he i U

Turning  to ermany  and  its  orward ate anel n  blue,    would  make G f r p i I four  points.  irst,   s nteresting  note hat  erman forward ates  roke F iti i to t G r b below  the urrent  -month  rate  ollowing  his  ommittee's eptember  29 c 3 f t C S decision  o ower  rates  y  25  basis oints.  econdly, t  s orth  at east t l b p S i i w l observing hat  ate  uts n  the eriphery  f uroland ad  no  impact  on t r c i p o E h German interest  te  xpectations. deed,  he  German rates  ave  backed  up ra e In t h gently nd  consistently  roughout    period f ate  uts y  other uropean a th a o r c b E countries.

Third,  uch ado  has  been  made of he olitical  essure  n  the m t p pr o Bundesbank  to  lower  rates  ollowing  he  German election,  t e do  not  see f t bu w that  n he  forward ates.  t  least  e don't  ee  any  downward or  upward i t r A w s movement after  he  initial  eak  downward in  the orward ates  ollowing t br f r f this ommittee's ction.   think here nfortunately    also   certain nse C a I t u is a se

of  irony n  that  olitical  tbursts y be  preventing  oth  the undesbank i p ou ma b B and  perhaps he uropean  Central  ank from  making a  rate  ut hat  hey t E B c t t might  be  inclined   make absent he  political  tbursts. to t ou

Finally,   s orth  noting hat  he erman 9-month  forward ate s lso it i w t t G r i a trading  elow  the -month  forward ate. o,  there till     decidedly b 3 r S s isa downward tilt   interest  te  xpectations   Germany. to ra e in

In  the ottom  panel  relating   apan, e can  see  the  rather  teady b toJ w s trading  n  a  clump  of orward ates  round  and  just  elow the urrent i f r a b c 3-month  rate,  eflecting  e ank of apan's  olicy  f  providing  mple r th B J p o a liquidity.  t  these arrow  ranges,    think,  ask a  number of ther Bu n I m o developments  in  Japanese oney markets. m

If ou turn o  the econd  page, n he  top anel, ou  can  see  one y t s i t p y measure  of he  Japan  premium,  which  is xpressed  ere s  the pread t e h a s between  the  3-month  Bank of okyo/Mitsubishi  LIBOR  rate,  nd  the T $ a $LIBOR  rate  ixing  n  London. You can  see  that  he  spread s ising ch f i t i r mu earlier is  ear han  it  id  last  ear. he real  hock  that  ccurred  o  the th y t d y T s o t Japan  premium last  ovember and  into  he  year-end  ollowed he ank N t f t b closings  n apan.  This ear,  e see  more of  a  persistent  drift om  the i J y w up fr summer through he  fall, flecting  hink he  broadening nd  now t re I  t t a generalized  egative  entiment  oward  the apanese inancial ctor  nd, n s t J f se a more recently  his  utumn,  the ffects  f isk  version  nd  credit  ine t a e o r a a l cutbacks o  Japanese anks  by  non-Japanese  anks. t b b

In  their  earch or lternative  urces f ollar  unding,  he apanese s f a so o d f t J banks  have  turned  way from  the urodollar  arket  and  toward he oreign a E m t f exchange  swap market  where  they uy dollars d  sell  en  spot,  nd b an y a simultaneously ter  orward  contracts   sell  ollars  nd  buy  yen. As the en f to d a Japanese anks  have  swarmed into he  swap  market  eager o wap out f b t t s o yen  and  into ollars, plicit sts f  yen  funding ave  fallen  oward  and d im co o h t through ero  for on-Japanese  anks, s  you can  see n  the ottom  panel. z n b a i b Here,  the ed ine  epicts  he -month  yen  interbank rrowing ate  n r l d t 3 bo r i Tokyo--the verage orrowing  rate or apanese anks--and  he  green  line  s a b f J b t i the  implied  en borrowing ate  or on-Japanese  anks  taken  from  the y r f n b prevailing ot-forward  wap and  $LIBOR  rates, suming  covered nterest sp s as i rate  arity. p

The  extraordinary  vement into egative  erritory  flects    least  wo mo n t re at t factors.  here  is educed emand for en  funding n  general n  global T r d y i i financial  rkets,  ith  the  general elevering d  the  unwinding  of he ma w d an t carriage  ate hat  as  been  abruptly  ccurring  hroughout  he all. ere  also r t h o t t f Th is he  increased  upply f en  coming into he wap  market  from  Japanese t s o y t s banks  looking or ollar  unding. hese  two,  the  demand/supply exus, f d f T n

Not  depicted  ere  but ccurring  imultaneously  nother  ffect  ou h o s isa e y may have  seen  reported  n  the apers,  amely  the  glut f en  in  the ands  of i p n o y h non-Japanese  anks  that hey ow seek  to  invest  o void redit  isk.  his  is b t n t a c r T driving  apanese reasury ill  ates  oward  and  through ero, ot  at he J T b r t z n t auctions  ut n  secondary arket  trading. b i m

Turning  to he op  panel f he  next age, ou  can  see  selected edit t t o t p y cr spreads  n  the .S.  markets epicted  n arious  ime  slices: rst,   he ime i U d i v t fi att t of  your  last  eeting; econd,  ust  efore he ntermeeting te ut; nd  third m s j b t i ra c a on November 13 which was last  riday. he table  lso hows  the ighs nd F T a s h a the  lows  for his  ear. he simple bservation  ne  can  make is hat  preads t y T o o t s are  down from  their  ighs nd  from  where  they ere  in  mid-October,  ut h a w b they  are ot  down a  great eal. n d

The more interesting  oblem  in y view  is hat  t  s ery  hard o udge pr m t i i v t j where spreads hould e.  I  don't  ant  to  pretend  hat    have  any  idea. s b w t I I think  hat ncertainty    a  real roblem  for he arket.  Most  people now t u is p t m k and  understand  hat  he ighs  were  somewhat uncomfortable.  ost  people t t h M understand  hat  he ows  of ast  pring  ere  probably nsustainable. t t t l l s w u Bu what  that  eans in  these ather  isk  verse ear-end  unding arkets s hat m r r a y f m i t the  market  as  a  whole  has  yet nother hallenge  f ust  rying  o  find   new a c o j t t a equilibrium  or hese arious redit  roducts. at  in  itself   uite f t v c p Th isq a challenge.

In  the ottom  panel,  e have  depicted  he preads etween  the op  tier b w t s b t and  second  tier r 0-day  and  for 0-day  commercial  paper,  ith he fo 9 3 w t former  spread hown in  the lue ine nd  the atter    the ed  line.   hould s b l a l in r Is be  careful  o oint  ut hat  hese preads re ased  on indices.  his anel,  n t p o t t s a b T p i brief, ows  the  more pronounced  than ormal  year-end ffect  e are sh n e w experiencing is  ear.

Turning  to  domestic perations,   did ot  do  quite  s  well  as  I  would o we n a have  liked ince our  last  eeting n ontaining  he ed  funds ate round s y m i c t f r a the  Committee's  arget.  o,   thought his  ight  be  a  useful  ime  to  show t S I t m t you  a  little  out ow  we assess  ur  own performance. n page  4  we have ab h o O depicted  he  distribution aily bservations  ne  standard  eviation  f t fd o ofo d o the  fed unds  trading  ange nd  of he eviation  f he ed  funds  effective f r a t d o t f rates  rom  the arget.  n the  vertical  is,  e have  a  measure  of olatility f t O ax w v

In  the op  panel,  he reen  dashed i f f m t t g line  s he ommittee's arget, e  blue  vertical nes  epresent e ederal i t C t th li r h f funds  trading  ange  on  each  day, he ed orizontal ck  s he aily ffective r t r h ti i t d e rate,  nd  the ed  vertical ne  hows one  standard  eviation  he ed  funds a r li s d oft f trading  ange.

Looking  at  both f  these  anels t  the ame time ut ocusing  n  the o p a s b f o top  panel,  wo  background  factors me into  lay  that    think  re  useful  or t ca p I a f you  to ote. First,  ere as a  rather  ignificant  ift  f olume into he  fed n th w s sh o v t funds  brokered arket  in  late  eptember  and  October. his  shift flected m S T re a cutting  ack  of redit  ines  nd  a  general  version  o isk  n  the erm unding b c l a a t r i t f markets  by  both  buyers nd  sellers.  the ending ide,  here  as an a On l s t w aversion  o  lending  oney at onger  erm  and  over ear-end,  nd  that t m l t y a created    reluctance   post ffers.  n the uying  side,  here  as an a to o O b t w aversion  o e  seen  placing  ids igh  enough  to  attract  e imited  mount  of t b b h th l a money the ther ide  was willing  o  sell--a  luctance   post ids. o,  we o s t re to b S saw a  literal  inning  ut f he  market, ith  a  paucity f ffers  nd  bids nd th o o t w o o a a a  consequent hift  f oth  demand and  supply o  the vernight  arket.  But s o b t o m the  rush f his  olume  into he vernight  arket  induced he inds f o t v t o m t k o behavior  atterns  hat  ontributed   volatility. p t c to

The second  consistent  ckground  factor  uring his  eriod as that  he ba d t p w t major  banks  that  ormally ould  be  willing   act s  two-way traders  ended n w to a t to  hold  on  to  unds hrough ost  of he  day  in his  eriod.  hey were f t m t t p T willing  o  sell  hose unds ate  n he ay  at ery  low  rates, ich  they t t f l i t d v wh viewed  as  the  expected ost f inimizing he isk  hat  hey  might  have  to c o m t r t t come to  the  discount  indow. This  was true  ot nly  of anks  that ere w n o b w subject  o umors.  Discount indow aversion  ffected  he ull  ange  of t r w a t f r depository  nstitutions. i

The first allenge  e faced  after  he ate  ut t he eptember  29 ch w t r c a t S meeting  was the onth-  and  quarter-end   September  30 when markets m on usually  re uite ight.  ou can  see  that  e had  a  wide  trading  ange  and  a a q t Y w r firm  market  on  that  ay.  We  supplied  eserves   an  effort   lean gainst d r in o a the  market's  irmness  n  that  ay  and  on  subsequent  ays  when the irmness f o d d f seemed  to arry ver. he resulting  cess eserves  ed o  the oft ates  hat c o T ex r l t s r t were  hard  to ounter  oward  the  close f hat  eriod. c t o t p

During  the econd  maintenance eriod,  t  as widely ssumed  that  he s p i w a t intermeeting nouncement  of  lower ates  t  3:15  p.m.  on October  15 an r a reflected   abrupt ction o  deal ith  one  or  two  troubled  nstitutions.  s an a t w i Thi

then  caused  an  extreme evel  f  discount  indow  aversion  ver he l o w o t subsequent  ays, articularly  you can  see  in  the hart  n  October  16,  19, d p as c o 20,  and  21. We  faced   trading  ange hat  as consistently  ove  the arget, a r t w ab t the  blue ine,  uring he orning  on  those ays  as  banks  held  on  to s  many l d t m d a reserves  s  they ould o  avoid ate  ay  surprises d  the isk  hat  hey ight a c t l d an r t t m have  an  overdraft   their  eserve  ccount. nce they eached   comfort on r a O r a level here  they  felt  hey  were  not ikely   see  an  overdraft   the nd  of w t l to at e the  day, hey ere  all illing  o  sell  heir nds n  the arket  at uite  ow t w w t t fu i m q l rates.  he surplus  eserves  e had  been  providing  o  lean gainst  he T r w t a t heightened  ates  hen egan  to  show through. r t b

I  should cknowledge  that  uring his  eriod  e were  reluctant    be a d t p w to stingy  ate  n  the eriod  or ear  hat   negative  iss n  our art  ight  spike l i p f f t a m o p m the unds  rate  pward  or  force   reluctant  nk  to he iscount  indow. f u a ba t d w That  would  make it  ven  harder  or s  to  lower he ate  o he ntended  evel e f u t r t t i l on subsequent ays.  We faced  similar fficulties  und  the  October d di aro month-end, hich was in  the  next aintenance eriod,  ut  as  you can  see  on w m p b the  chart  arket onditions  ay now be  stabilizing.  s y hope  that  e m c m It  m i w can  do  better,  t   think,  o e  candid,  hat e may continue  o  face n bu I t b t w t a extreme  form  of iscount  indow aversion  nd  some volatility ough d w a thr year-end nd  into anuary. a J

Finally, ould like  o  discuss    few matters  elating    our  outright I  w t a r to operations.  e  have  reduced  the ize f ur  normal  purchases f reasury W s o o o T coupon  securities  at  e do  at  one  time  to  about 600  or 700  million.  n th w $ $ I the  relatively  liquid  nditions  e have  seen, oing nto he arket  for il co w g i t m smaller  nd  smaller  ites  t ny  given ime  means that  e cause ess  nd a b a a t w l a less  isruption   the  market.  I  am quite leased  hat  espite  he olatile d in p t d t v conditions  e have  experienced, r  operations ve  become something f  a w ou ha o non-event. hat  is recisely e  objective  oward  which  I  have  been T p th t aspiring.

A second  item  I  want  to  mention--and  ive  you  an  opportunity g to express  n opinion,  f  ou wish--is  intention  urchase nflationa i y my top i indexed  securities    our utright erations.   have  not een  purchasing in o op We b such  securities    the econdary arket.  We  have  been  acquiring  hem at in s m t auction.   know that  hen we began  doing  so,   couple f embers of  the I w a o m Committee  expressed    degree f eluctance,  ndering  why the  Federal a o r wo Reserve  needed  inflation  otection.  Laughter]   would  like  o e  clear. pr [ I t b We  do  not  buy  them  because e need  inflation  otection.  buy them w pr We because  the reasury ssues  hem.  The general  sset  lass  nvolved  n  all T i t a c i i our  purchases s .S.  government  credit.  the reasury as  shrunk he i U As T h t size f  its  ill  ssues,  have  not een  able o urchase ills   the ame o b i we b t p b in s proportion  o  coupon securities    we did n he  past. e  do  not urchase t as i t W p agency  securities  tright.   accept hem  in  repo, nd  I  have  no  particular ou We t a

desire  o  acquire  hem  on  an  outright sis. ut  if  e should ave  the ood t t ba B w h g fortune  o  confront  ederal  overnment  surpluses  oing  forward,  e are t f g g w going  to  face he hallenging  uestion f inding  ew asset  lasses  o  add  to t c q o f n c t SOMA over  time.  So,  as  long  as  the reasury s ssuing  ndexed ecurities, T i i i s I think t  s seful  or s  to  buy  them  at east  n ough  proportion  o heir i i u f u l i r t t issuance  y  the  Treasury. b

I  mention  this  ecause s  an  operational  tter,  t oesn't ke any b a ma i d ma sense or s  to urchase he  indexed ssues  t he  same time  we're  uying f u p t i a t b the  regular  oupon  securities.    cannot udge  the elative lue f egular c We j r va o r coupons  and  indexed ecurities.  ,  to  make this  perationally  actical, s So o pr I propose o  go  into he arket  and  do  a  mini  pass f he ntire  ndex ield t t m o t e i y curve.  I  suppose  we would start t y  purchasing  round  $300  to 500 ou b a $ million.  'm  not ntirely re ow much we might  purchase n  a  mini  pass I e su h i of he  index  yield  urve. or  every 5 to 7 billion at  e purchased  f t c F $ $ th w o regular  oupon  securities, would  periodically  nduct ne  or  two  passes c we co o to  buy  a  small ranche  f he  indexed ecurities  nchmarked  against  ach t o t s be e other  o  allow s  to  make some relative lue hoices bout he  prices  he t u va c a t t dealers  ere  showing  us.  But  I  did ot ant  to o  this  ithout nforming w n w d w i you in  advance  and  giving ou  an  opportunity  xpress our  views  on  the y toe y subject.

Mr.  Chairman, e had  no  foreign  xchange  intervention  erations w e op during he  period.    will eed  the ommittee's  atification  ur  domestic t I n C r of  o operations.  would  be  happy  to  answer  any  questions  n any  aspect f y I o o m report, t  I  think ur lan s o  seek  a  vote n  the atification    then  go bu o p i t o r and on  to  the wo special  tems. t i

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I  have  observed hat  e are ontinuously  etting    glut t w c g a of  yen  and  a  disinclination old  them, ut he versupply  oes  not eem to  be  spilling  er to  h b t o d s ov into he  foreign  xchange  markets n  any  significant  y.

MR.  FISHER.  That  is   very  good  question, d  I  wish  I  had  a  precise  nswer  to  it. a an a I think hat  t  s mportant  o  look t  the ast  wo  months.  I  didn't lk    lot bout he ig  move in t i i i t a l t a a a t b the  dollar/yen at e had.  That  was an  extraordinary  ent,  bviously,   terms f he  standard th w ev o in o t deviation  f he ove. It as also n  extraordinary ent n  terms f he actors  hat  ame into o t m w a ev i o t f t c

play.  One major  fund  began  to ove rapidly  ut  of  a  series  f ositions   has  been  reported  n m o o p as i the  markets. ther  funds  then  had  positions at riggered-O th t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. This  was a  yen-carry  eversal? r

MR. FISHER.  This  was the  unwinding  of  the  yen-carry  eversal  nd  a  move down in r a the  dollar/yen.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You just  xpressed  hat  n  terms f  a  double egative! e t i o n MR.  FISHER.  Right!  I  see  the  big ove  down in  the ollar/yen  ust    reflection m d asj a of the elevering. at  delevering  as going  on  in  many places,  nd  one  place here  it howed up d Th w a w s was in  the ollar/yen change  rate.  he latter  en riggered  series  f xtraordinary d ex T th t a o e movements that eveloped nto    big  technical ve down,  forgive  he  term.  In  the eneral d i a mo t g back-up  of he ollar  gainst  he  yen  in arkets  dominated y  considerable certainty  d t d a t m b un an reluctance   take isks,  think  e were  seeing recisely e ffect  hat    believe  ou  are rying  o to r I w p th e t I y t t explain.  he glut f  yen  has  been  spilling  er  gradually  nd  not n  the hocking ay in  which T o ov a i s w the  downward move occurred. ut  we are  getting    move back  up  in  the ollar.  he market  has B a d T gone  from  111 back  to  the  120-123  range.  If  e were  not ooking t  that  gainst  he tandard  f w l a a t s o a  move from  124  down to  111,  the ize f  this  ove back  up  would  seem impressive. s o m

MS. RIVLIN.  We  didn't ow that  here ere  no bonds  in  our  portfolio! aughter] kn t w [L MR.  JORDAN.

As I  understand  t,    problem t s t s by t i a with  that  arket as  been  its  lliquidity;  ot   market hat  as  developed readth nd  depth, m h i it  sn i a t h b a and all  hose hings. or  us  to  buy  up  some of hese ecurities  d  remove  them from  the arket t t F t s an m when it s till    its  arly tages f evelopment ould  be  troubling,    I  think e should i s in e s o d w so w proceed  very  slowly nd  carefully  fore ngaging n his  ctivity. d then  there's e  notion a be e i t a An th you alluded  o, egarding  he  public  olicy  erception  f he entral  ank  buying  inflation t r t p p o t c b protection.

MR. FISHER.  There  is omething  of  a  "Catch-22" bout he  liquidity  sue.

MR. FISHER.  The discount  indow aversion  s robably he  message.  Don Kohn w i p t and  I ave  been  working  for everal  ears ith  the iscount  fficers   the  System.

MR. POOLE. I  agree ith  Jerry ordan hat  t  oes  not atter,   buying  securities w J t i d m in at auction,  hether he reasury s ssuing  onventional nds  or  TIPS. In  either  ase, e are ust w t T i i c bo c w j taking  hem  off  he arket.

I  understand  here  Peter  s oming  from, ut  I  would  feel ore i o t r n w i c b m comfortable  f  he IPS market  were  deeper; ith ime  it  ay become deeper,  nd  in  that  vent i t T w t m a e we would  have  less  mpact  on  it.    recognize  hat  eter  as  had  discussions th reasury i I t P h wi T officials  d  that  his  ay be  worked out,  ut  I  certainly  uld  feel  ore comfortable  f  e an t m b wo m i w waited.

On the  second  point,    would  like  o  come back  to  Governor  Rivlin's  quiry  bout he I t in a t discount  indow. This  is  not he ime, ut  I  know  that  ome work  has  been  done  on  how the w t t b s discount  indow could e  put  to  better e.  Some papers ere written  nd  some options  ere w b us w a w explored  ut  not  followed  p.  I  think here  ere  some good  suggestions   those apers hat b u t w in p t could  make the  discount  indow an  instrument  hat  he arket  might  be  more comfortable  sing w t t m u

On the  TIPS issue,  t  eems  to  me that  y  our nactivity  the IPS market  we have i s b i in T been saying hat  ndexed ecurities  mehow  are  different  om  other  reasury ecurities.  d t i s so fr T s An our  failure   treat  hem  like ther overnment  securities  ys  either at e do  not  approve  of to t o g sa th w them or  that  e are efraining  om  buying hem  in  order  o  help hem  to  become a  more  reliable w r fr t t t predictor   inflation.  wever,  it  eems  to  me that  y  treating dexed ecurities  fferently of Ho s b in s di and by  not aving  our  normal  relationship  th  the ealers  n egard o hese ecurities   adversely h wi d i r t t s we affect  he upply nd  demand for ndexed ecurities  lative    other ecurities.   ould  be t s a i s re to s Itw better,   a  marginal nhancement  to  the iquidity   he OMA as e l oft S and  to ave  a  balanced iew  of h v U.S.  Treasury ecurities    general,  o  buy  indexed ecurities  ong he  lines  f he  very odest s in t s al t o t m program  that  eter isher  as  suggested  han  not o uy them.

MR. BROADDUS. Just ne  other omment on your  comment,  Mr.  Chairman, n  the o c o forecasting efulness  f  TIPS. I  think t's  portant  o eep  in  mind that  e are  in  a  period  f us o i im t k w o very  low inflation  d  very  low  inflation  pectations.  e were  to  move back  into    situation an ex Ifw a where  there  as more inflation,  hink  e can  foresee  hat  ndexed ecurities  uld  be  a  more w I  t w t i s wo useful  orecasting ol.   guess, ed,  if  e are  doing hese perations d  find urselves  n  a f to I N w t o an o i situation ere  we might  want  to ull ack,   would  be  concerned hat t  ight  be  very ifficult wh p b I t i m d to  do  so.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You are  probably ight  n  the ense hat  he lliquidity r i s t t i premium almost  surely  oes  not  fluctuate th  the  inflation  emium. As a  gross easure, t d wi pr m i must  be  useful  o  some extent.  t  this oint,  would suggest  hat here  as  been  enough t A p I t t h discussion  bout  the IPS issue,  nd  I  think t ight  be  useful  or avid  Lindsey  to ake a  quick a T a i m f D m survey f  everyone's  iew  on  this  uestion  nd  provide is urvey esults   Peter isher  o  give o v q a h s r to F t him a  sense f  where  the ommittee  members  stand n  the  issue.  hen,  if  eter  eels  hat  e o C o T P f t h does  not  have  Committee  support,   ill e  up  to im to et n  the elephone  nd  try o uster it w b h g o t a t m it.    suggest  hat  e try  o  deal ith  this  nformally d  hopefully  ore expeditiously.  at is I t w t w i an m Wh your  deadline  n  making a  decision, ter? o Pe

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without  objection.  et  us  move on  to  Mike Prell  nd L a Karen  Johnson.

MR. PRELL.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Over  the ast ouple f p c o weeks,  participants  the  financial rkets ave  become less ertain at in ma h c th this  eeting  will ring nother  asing tep. y  sense s hat  hey ontinue m b a e s M i t t c to  perceive  hat  ou're  trongly  ommitted  to  keeping he conomic t y s c t e expansion ntact,  t hat  hey  see  recent  evelopments n  the arkets nd  in i bu t t d i m a the  economy as  raising me question  bout  at east  he rgency  of urther so a l t u f policy ction. a

The sources f  this  ncertainty out  what  you  will ecide o  do  have o u ab d t their  arallels    risks  hat  e noted  in reenbook. While  our  forecast p in t w G hasn't  hanged  very  much from  that  resented  t he  last  eeting,  his c p a t m t doesn't  ean that  e have  a  great  eal  of onfidence  hat  his  s hat  would m w d c t t i w transpire der  the ssumed  policy. e  are  still  nfronted  ith  an un a W co w uncomfortably  road  range  of lausible tcomes. b p ou

For  example, t's  t  difficult  imagine  scenario  n  which  the redit i no to a i c markets  continue heir  ealing  rocess,  he  stock arket  moves to ew t h p t m n highs,  nd  aggregate  emand barrels  long. ou can  get  sense f hat a d a Y a o w that  ight  look  like  y  blowing  up  the ifferential  ween  the aseline  nd m b d bet b a the higher tock rices"  imulation  n  the  Greenbook, hich  involved nly " s p s i w o maintenance f  last  eek's arket  level. n the  other and, t's  st  s  easy o w m O h i ju a to  imagine  a  scenario  n  which  there  s nother  ignificant  sturbance   the i i a s di to world  economy and  financial stem, erhaps  precipitated    a  "meltdown" sy p by in  Brazil;  e have  offered    far rom  extreme  version f his  n he w a f o t i t Greenbook  as  well.

Karen will ave  something o  say  about he  international look ut, h t t out b before hat,    would  like o ffer    few  comments on the orces  urrently t I t o a f c at work  domestically.

First,  e  fact  hat  DP  growth  in  the hird  uarter  pparently th t G t q a outstripped  our  expectations vites e  conclusion  hat  e've  once  again in th t w underestimated  he omentum t m of  demand in  the conomy. However,  the e upside  surprise pears o  have  been  pretty  uch an  inventory  tory.  n  that ap t m s I regard,   hould ote  that  his  orning's  eport  n  retail ventories owed Is n t m r o in sh that,  utside  f uto ealers,  tocks ere  little  anged  in  September-o o a d s w ch probably mplying  only  a  marginal ownward revision  o  our  third-quarter i d t guess.  As we said n  the  Greenbook,  we don't  hink hat  here  s  a  major i t t t i overhang  of nwanted  stocks n  the  aggregate;  ut nventory-sales  tios u i b i ra have  climbed,  nd they re uite igh  in  a  few  industries.   a  minimum, I a a q h At believe  e should nticipate  at  usinesses,   east  utside  he  auto  sector, w a th b atl o t will e attempting  o  curb  the ace  of  accumulation.  hat  may well  be  one b t p T reason  why the enor  f  news from  the anufacturing  ector  as  been  quite t o m s h negative  f  late. o

Over the ast ouple  of  years,  e've  often nderestimated e  desire  f p c w u th o businesses  o  maintain apid ates  f nventory  ccumulation, sically t r r o i a ba because  we underestimated  he  strength  f inal  emand. But, ecently, t o f d r domestic inal  emand has  not  been  any  stronger an  we anticipated; f d th it wasn't  n  the hird  uarter, d  last  riday's gures  howing  a  hefty ctober i t q an F fi s O advance  in  retail les  ere  closely  n  line  ith ur  expectations. reover, sa w i w o Mo the  greater  rowth  of utput vidently s  not enerated  ny  extra  obs nd g o e ha g a j a labor ncome.  Instead, yroll  rowth  has  slowed  more than e expected, i pa g w and  there eems  to e  some pickup  in orporate  ownsizing nnouncements. s b c d a This  may be  one  reason hy the arly ovember Michigan  SRC  survey-w e N while  showing  a  considerable unceback  in  the  sentiment  ndex--didn't bo i show much improvement  in  employment  expectations.

The  flip  ide f  the ore moderate  growth  of abor ncome  may have s o m l i been  a  shade  healthier rporate  rofit rformance han  we anticipated. co p pe t

But  the  trend f rofits  till ak over  the ast everal  uarters  nd, o p iss we p s q a though  hope  springs  ternal  he tock arket, he  deterioration e int s m t in corporate  ash  flow  is   negative  or apital ending. he anecdotal c a f c sp T evidence  suggests  hat, ether  for hat  eason r  simply ecause hey on't t wh t r o b t d see  current  nd  prospective mand warranting  urther ditions  o  capacity, a de f ad t many firms--especially  ufacturers--are  aring ack  their  nvestment man ge b i programs.

I've  ot  mentioned he  developments n  the  debt nd  equity  arkets, n t i a m per  se, n y comments on  the  spending icture.  he  jury s till t  on i m p T i s ou whether  the ecent urmoil  s  going o  leave   substantial  rk  on  the eal r t i t a ma r economy. On the  credit  ide,  he  bond  markets  have  reopened or usiness s t f b in  terms f ew issuance  ctivity,  d  spreads re  narrowing. he o n a an a T commercial  paper arket  is aving  some difficulty  commodating the m h ac over-the-year-end  rrowing y firms hat  re  not n  the  top redit  ungs,  ut bo b t a i c r b banks  are  filling  --sometimes luctantly--and se ensions  resumably in re tho t p will e  behind  us  in  a  couple f onths. b o m

Nonetheless,  still ink t's  asonable  o  anticipate  at t  ill ake we th i re t th i w t a while  for he ting  f he  recent  xperience  o  wear  off ully, d  that  he t s o t e t f an t capital  arkets  will ontinue  o  show a  greater  ensitivity iquidity  d m c t s to  l an credit  isk  onsiderations.  e commercial  banks  are  not  insulated om  the r c Th fr capital  arkets,  nd  they oo  have  learned  omething bout he  risks  acing m a t s a t f them in  their  ending  ctivities;  sequently,  don't  xpect he ecent l a con we e t r tightening   loan  terms nd  standards  o e  reversed  mmediately.  nd, of a t b i A although he  decline  n  the evel  f nterest  tes  or rime  borrowers, t i l o i ra f p supported  y the ed's asing,  akes ome of he  bite  ut  of his ightening, b F e t s t o t t credit  erms verall  ave  deteriorated  r ome higher  isk  nterprises  d t o h fo s r e an certainly  e  trend oward  ever asier  ccess o  credit  as  been  halted. th t e a t h

Similarly,  spite  he  rousing  ally  hat  as  occurred  n  recent  eeks in de t r t h i w the  stock arket, nless  hat  ise  ontinues  e also hould ee  the mpetus m u t r c w s s i from  wealth  effects ning  in  the oming  months. As we indicated   the wa c in Greenbook,  this  s   real  ild  card n he utlook. e  believe  hat  he i a w i t o W t t market  is  skating  n  thin  ce,  t est,  iven he rend f rofits;    that o i a b g t t o p in context,  ur  prediction   a  10  percent  rice ecline  ight  even  be  said o e o of p d m t b conservative,    it ould  leave he  averages onsiderably ove  their  ecent as w t c ab r lows.  But  tell  hat  o  an investor o has  once  again een  demonstrated  he t t wh s t virtues  f uying  on  dips nd  who hears arket  gurus hanting  he  mantra o b a m c t that  you  don't  ight  he ed." And one  might  ask  what  earnings  ave  to  do " f t F h with  share rices, yway,  when any  company with  "dot om" p an c can generate a  huge  market  capitalization  rnight  n a  base  of othing  ut  losses. ove o n b

In  sum,  while e believe  ou should iew  financial nditions w y v co as having  shifted   a  less ccommodative  direction nce ugust, his  learly in a si A t c

is   situation  at  ill ave  to e  monitored losely  n he  coming  weeks. a th w h b c i t We're  dealing  ith  volatile enomena,  the mplications  hich  can  be w ph i ofw difficult   udge. toj

In  any  event,  ven  if  e have  the ggregate  emand outlook  ight, at e w a d r th still  aves onsiderable certainty out  the rospects  or nflation. le c un ab p f i Recent  news has  been  quite  mbiguous  on  this  core. he ECI for he hird a s T t t quarter,  the  face  of t,  aised  ome serious  uestions  egarding  ur on i r s q r o forecast  f   peaking n  wage and  compensation ncreases, t  it  as o a i i bu w followed y hints  f  a  moderation n  the  trend f  average ourly arnings. b o i o h e Among  the ajor  price ndexes,  ith  an  increase  f wo-tenths  ast  onth m i w o t l m the  year-on-year ange  in  the ore  CPI  dropped  back  to .3  percent--not  r ch c 2 fa above  its  ow  point.  owever,  the hain rice  ndex  for DP  apparently l H c p i G decelerated rther  ast  uarter.  oing  forward,  he ecent  oftening  f he fu l q G t r s o t dollar  uggests  hat  he rices  f mports ay not  continue  o xert o  great s t t p o i m t e s a  disinflationary  ect, t  anecdotally e  hears hat  he  oncoming  flow  of eff bu on t t cheap  Asian  goods  will esult   significantly  er etail ices  n  the irst r in low r pr i f half  f ext  year. here  is omething or very  taste  n  this  age-price tew. o n T s f e i w s I  think  e've aken n  honest ampling rom  the ot,  ather  han  picking  ut w t a s f p r t o the  bits  hat  ost  appeal o s; ut  you  may disagree, d  we'll  e  happy  to t m t u b an b answer  any  questions  ou  may wish  to ut  to  us  regarding  ur iew. y p o v

But, irst,      may,  let  e turn he loor  ver o aren. f if I m t f o t K

MS. JOHNSON. As we stated  n  the reenbook, ur  forecast is  ime i G o h t for he  external  ector  s ot uch changed  from  that  n  September. e t s i n m i W have  chosen  not o  assume  that  he epreciation  he  dollar  uring  he t t d oft d t intermeeting riod ill e  significantly ersed.  s a  consequence,  ur pe w b rev A o path  for  he ollar  oing orward s bout  3  percent  ower  in  the ear erm, t d g f i a l n t and  about  2  percent ower oward he  end  of he  forecast riod,  han ast l t t t pe t l time.

Such a  change  in  our  outlook or he ollar  y  itself  uld  tend o f t d b wo t stimulate ports  nd  restrain ports. ffsetting is  timulus  or xports x a im O th s f e to  some extent  s   somewhat weaker  projection r eal utput rowth  in i a fo r o g our  trading  artners. p

By far he  biggest  ownward revision   our  outlook  or rowth  abroad t d in f g has  been  to  ur  view on  Japan.  We  now expect hat  he  trough n  real  utput o t t i o will ot  occur ntil  ometime  in  2000.  This  more negative  utcome is n u s o expected espite  njections   fiscal  timulus  f  about  1-1/2  percent  f DP d i of s o o G next  year. e  are  thus xpecting  ontinuing  eclines  n  private  omestic W e c d i d demand,  particularly iness  nvestment, th  little    no  help  from  the bus i wi or external  ector.  ince he  Greenbook  was published,  have  learned ome s S t we s additional tail  bout  the atest scal ckage  proposed y  the apanese de a l fi pa b J

The package  contains    trillion   of ersonal  nd  corporate 6 yen p a tax  cuts,  n  estimated trillion   of  "real  ater" xpenditures,  d  an a 6 yen w e an additional ray f  measures  that  re  expected o rovide ittle  rect ar o a t p l di economic  stimulus.  ccordingly,  he  actual  timulus  ontained  n  the A t s c i package  is robably ot  more than  half  he 4  trillion dline  alue nd  is p n t 2 hea v a broadly n  line ith  the apanese iscal sumptions  n  the ovember i w J f as i N Greenbook.  Given  the  lags n  implementing hese  ackages,  e expect hat i t p w t the  effects   these easures  will e  felt  uring he econd  half  f  1999,  as of m b d t s o the ffects  rom  the pril  1998 package, hich  we think  re  now becoming e f A w a visible,  gin  to  wane. be

The other ountry f articular  terest    this  orecast und  is razil. c o p in in f ro B In  putting  ogether  he orecast,  r  strategy s  been  to  assume  that  he t t f ou ha t international cue ackage  for razil  ucceeds n  the  sense hat  o  abrupt res p B s i t n change  in he xchange  rate  egime  is orced pon Brazil,  nd  no  contagion t e r f u a in  that  espect  pills er  to  Argentina  r lsewhere.  eal  GDP  in  Brazil  s r s ov o e R i expected o  decline  his  uarter  nd  through 999,  but  the rough s ow t t q a 1 t i n projected  o  occur n  early  000,  and  some recovery  egins hat  ear. his t i 2 b t y T contraction sults om  the  high  interest  tes  lready  n lace,  hich are re fr ra a i p w projected  o  ease ome,  and  the iscal straint  at  s art f he olicy t s f re th i p o t p program  Brazil  as  announced.

There  are  many pitfalls   he  months  ahead  that  ould ut he  Brazilian int c p t program  off rack. n  the ear erm, razil nd  its  rivate  reditors st t I n t B a p c mu reach  an  understanding ch  that  ost, ut ot ecessarily  l,  f he su m b n n al o t short-term  xternal  redits   Brazil  re  maintained.  omestic  creditors  so e c to a D al must  refrain  net rom  moving capital t  of  Brazil.  he fiscal  genda on f ou T a must  proceed;  n  particular,   Brazilian ngress  must  enact rucial i the Co c proposed  measures  so  that  n  IMF review lanned or ebruary  1999 will  e a p f F b successful.   recognize  hat  t  s ar rom  certain  hat  ll his  ill roceed We t i i f f t a t w p smoothly.  In  the reenbook, t eemed to  us  more useful o resent  n  the G i s t p i baseline  he mplications r he  foreign  ector  nder  the  assumption f t i fo t s u o "success,"  s  at he oment that  utcome  is eing ctively  ursued y a t m o b a p b officials    Brazil  nd  at he MF.

MR. MCTEER. For  Mike Prell,   Part  of he  Greenbook, age  III-19, ere  s in 2 t p th i a sentence  hat  ays  "Growth of  retail ney market  mutual  funds  and  of  currency utstanding, t s mo o both  domestically d  overseas,  as strong  ver  the ost  recent  wo  months."  Do we have  any an w o m t indication   overseas oldings  f  currency,  hether  they ave  increased  ignificantly, of h o w h s and whether  we ought  to  be  taking  hat  nto ccount hen we look  at he  growth  rate  f 2? t i a w t o M

MR.  PRELL.  Dave Lindsey  follows  hat  ore closely  han  I  do. t m t

MR.  LINDSEY. We  were  actually ompted  by  a  question  rom  Governor  Gramlich  a pr f couple  of  months  ago  to  look ntensively  to his  uestion.  e  have  considerably proved  our i in t q W im estimation  rocedures,  ncluding  ur  seasonal  djustment  rocedures.  e  have  come up  now p i o a p W with  a  series  hat  e find o e  the est stimate  e can  produce.  What that  hows  is hat t w t b b e w s t whereas  in  recent  ears here  as  been an  effect  f   little  ss  han y t h o a le t 1/2 percent  n  the  growth  of o M2  coming  from  demand abroad,  hat  eems  to ave  lessened  ome most  recently. t  me give t s h s Le you some figures  o  suggest  hat  I'm alking  bout.  In  September nd  October,  ur  estimate  s t w t a a o i that  oreign  oldings  f .S.  currency rew at 3.8  percent  nd  8.5  percent  espectively.  at f h o U g 1 a r Th implied,  owever,  growth  of omestically ld .S.  currency  n  September  and  October  at ven h d he U i e faster  ates, -3/4 d  12-3/4  cent  espectively.  en  we contrast e  growth  of 2  with  the r 18 an per r Wh h M inclusion  nd  the xclusion  f oreign  urrency  oldings,  t  urns  ut  not o ake too  much of a e o f c h i t o t m a difference   those ecent  onths.  For  example, 2  as  we normally alculate ,  ncluding  he in r m M c iti t foreign  urrency oldings,  rew at  a  14.8  percent  ate  n  September.  Without he oreign c h g r i t f currency oldings,  e have  estimated  he  growth  to  be  14.9 ercent.  n  October,  he  two h w t p I t numbers are  12.3  percent nd  12.6  percent  espectively.  ,  on balance n  recent  onths  and a r So i m

recent  uarters,  oesn't ke a  material  ifference ether  we look  at  our verall  stimate  f q itd ma d wh o e o M2  or  our stimate  f  M2  stripping t  the oreign  urrency oldings. e o ou f c h

MR.  MCTEER. That  seems  kind  of ntuitive    me,  given hat  is oing  on  overseas. i to w g

With  regard o  national onomic  conditions, ould  note hat  lthough  he orecast t ec I  w t a t f for he  fourth uarter   this  reenbook  is own from  that  n  the ast  reenbook, he hird  uarter t q in G d i l G t t q came in  higher han as expected nd  therefore e econd  half  f  1998 now looks omewhat t w a th s o s stronger  han  at he ast  eeting.

With respect  o he ational  conomy, the reenbook  is rojecting  deceleration t t n e G p a of real rowth  to  a  below-trend  ate ext ear,  ven  with  an  assumed  further sing f onetary g r n y e ea o m policy. here  is o question  n y mind that  his  s  a  plausible recast,  t t  epends  heavily T n i m t i fo bu i d on  a  halving  f rowth  in  consumer  spending ext ear. hat  could appen, ut  it  eems  to  me o g n y T h b s far rom  a  sure hing. ertainly ere  s ot uch  evidence f  any  marked  deceleration f t C th i n m o of household pending  currently. oblems  in  capital  arkets o  not  appear o e  constraining s Pr m d t b consumer  credit  o  any  significant  gree. ome  have  argued hat  he ow  recent  aving ate t de S t t l s r could  crimp  consumer  outlays  oing  forward. ut  some empirical  ork and  research  e have g B w w done  at ur  Bank shows  that  n  average ver he ast  0  or  25  years ow saving ates  ave o o o t l 2 l r h

In  short,  t  eems  to e that  onsumer  spending ould ecelerate ss  han s rojected i s m c c d le t i p in  the reenbook.  If t  id,  verall  DP  growth  would be  close o otential,  ich  would  be  a G i d o G t p wh favorable  evelopment  in  my view.

On the  national  conomy,  I  want  to ay  a  few words  about oney and  monetary  policy e s m and  the onjecture  hat  hat  we have  seen  in  terms f ome of  the onetary  aggregates--notably c t w o s m mutual  fund  balances,  oney market  balances,  nd  various  ypes f avings alances--is  lated m a t o s b re

to  the  stock arket.  Saying hat  he  behavior  f  money just  eflects ecline  n  velocity ,  f m t t o r a  d i is o course,  autological;  oesn't  elp  us  to  understand  he  causality. y statement  bout  velocity t it d h t An a is  a  statement  bout he  demand for oney. If  t  ad  anything  o  do  with ncreased  ncertainty a t m i h t i u related  o he  capital  arkets nd  the  stock  arket, hen  we would  expect he ise  n elocity t t m a m t t r i v to be reversed  t ome point n  the  context  f  a  decline  n  the road  money measures.  Earlier   the a s i o i b in decade  when we saw no growth  in road  money measures  like  2  and  M3,  I  reached   comfort b M a level  ith  that  ecause ther easures  were  growing  very apidly.  sually hen we have  these w b o m r U w explanations  bout epositors,  ether  it  s ouseholds r  others  hat  re  shifting  eir  ehavior, a d wh i h o t a th b there re  disparate vements of  the  various  arrower nd  broader easures  of oney and a mo n a m m credit.  his  time  we are ot  seeing hat.  hat we are  seeing  s hat  he onetary  base djusted T n t W i t t m a for weep accounts,  ZM, s M M2, M3, total  ank  credit--all hese easures--have b of  t m simultaneously en  increasing ry  dramatically. hink his  s n issue  n  search f  an be ve I  t t i a i o explanation at  an  let  s  feel omfortable  ith  what  we can  see  going  on  and  that  ill eave s th c u c w w l u unconcerned  about he  implications  wn the  road.  But  I'm oncerned bout  the mplications t do c a i down the  road.  I  think  here's   east    risk  hat  e're oing o  see  that  onetary  growth t atl a t w g t m showing  up  in  ways,  whether  it's    the sset  arkets r n  the oods  markets,  hat  e are ot in a m o i g t w n going  to  be  happy  about.

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. The Second District  onomy is  slowing. he manufacturing  ector  n  northern  ew  Jersey  nd  western ec T s i N a New  York  is articipating he  general  lowing f  manufacturing  ationally  d  the rowth  in p in  t s o n an g the  service  ector  s ot  sufficient    make up  for t. he  housing rea s  also omewhat weaker. s i n to i T a i s Commercial construction    slowing,  argely  ecause f  restricted ilability redit.  etail is l b o ava of  c R sales  ere  weak in  September  and  bounced  back  some in  October nd  early  ovember. w a N

Nationally, elieve  hat  he  Greenbook  has  it bout ight.  ike  the reenbook,  we I  b t t a r L G see  economic  growth  well  below  trend  n  1999, ith  recovery  o  something ore like  rend i w t m t

Inflation   learly ll  controlled.    think  hat  he eakness  in  fixed  ncome isc we We t t w i markets,  lthough omewhat reduced,  s  still  potentially  rious  isk  o he eal conomy. a s i a se r t t r e When  we look  at he  likely essure  n  the anking  sector,   s orth  remembering  that  bout 5 t pr o b iti w a 2 percent  f  C&amp;I  loans ome from  the  money center  anks  and  about  another  5 percent  ome o c b 2 c from  foreign  anks  operating  n he nited tates.  oth  the  money center  anks  and  the oreign b i t U S B b f banks  are  dependent,  ust  s  their  ommercial ustomers re, n  purchased oney.

Consequently,    think here  s  a  possibility,     probability  t  a  distinct  ssibility, I t i nota bu po that  he  month of ecember could  be  a  particularly ficult  e  and  that  he roblems n  the t D dif on t p i financial ctor  ould ean that  ain Street, ich  has  been  holding p  very  resiliently any se c m M wh u as  m have  pointed  ut,  ill e  adversely  ffected.  herefore,    believe  hat  he isk  oming  from  the o w b a T I t t r c domestic conomy and  the  considerable sk oming  from  the oreign  ector  ndicate  hat  he e ri c f s i t t Greenbook  forecast,  ose growth  in  1999 I  would  not  find dequate,  s ore likely  han ot he wh a i m t n t better  f he ases hat  e can  expect. hus,  the ownside  risk s till ry  considerable d o t c t w T d i s ve an points  o  the eed  for ome additional tion  n our art. hank you,  Mr.  Chairman. t n s ac o p T

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  As we have  already eard,  here  re h t a significant  d  reasonable  cenarios  n  both  sides f  this  iscussion.  the ne  hand, e can an s o o d On o w believe  hat  he ost  recent  trength  n  the eal conomy will bate,  ut ust  lightly,   that  he t t m s i r e a b j s and t economy that  as  surprised   on the pside ime nd  again  will ontinue  o o  so.  In  this h us u t a c t d

reality,  bor nd  households eign upreme.  GDP  growth  comes in  for   soft  anding ithout la a r s a l w further lp  from  monetary  policy.  fter ll,  ne  might  say, n he hird  uarter e  economy he A a o i t t q th grew at  an  annual ate f  3.3  percent.  ousehold  spending s till  owing  about   percent.  his r o H i s gr 4 T strong  rowth  is ueled  y  jobs--as me have  indicated,  bor  arkets  are till  ght--and  ge g f b o la m s ti wa and  salary  rowth, nd  credit. g a

In  the ptimistic enario, nancial rkets re  described  s  fragile t  recovering. o sc fi ma a a bu The stock arket  continues  o efy  reasonable  nalysis  nd  gives dded  impetus o  consumer m t d a a a t spending,  nd  possibly  o  capital ending. ost importantly   this  ptimistic  enario, ia a t sp M in o sc As already  as  turned he  corner  nd  Brazil  voids he orst utcomes  due  to  timely nternational h t a a t w o i intervention.

For  me this  icture  s ery, ery  attractive,   I'm  afraid  hat  t  eflects  ly  a  limited p i v v but t i r on reality. elieve  hat  rowth  due  to  labor nd  household onsumption, hich  underpins  he  most I  b t g a c w t positive enario,   limited.  ob  creation  oes  seem to  have  slowed  considerably  ate. sc is J d ofl Secondly,  ote  that  ast  uarter's  P  growth  was  heavily ueled  y  inventories, ch  seems In l q GD f b whi unlikely  o  repeat. inally,    what  I  describe  s  the ore  pessimistic  enario, ere  s   great t F in a m sc th i a focus  on  capital d  capital  nvestment.  usiness ixed  nvestment  ell  n  the  last  uarter an i B f i f i q at about  a  1  percent  nnual ate, ich  I  think  s he irst cline  f hat  agnitude  since 990 or a r wh i t f de o t m 1 1991;  BFI admittedly  as retarded  y  nonresidential  nstruction,  t ven  investment  n w b co bu e i producers'  urable quipment  barely udged. d e b

More disturbingly, cdotal  nd  survey  evidence uggests  hat  apital  pending lans ane a s t c s p for any firms ave  been  revised  ownward. This  slowdown reflects  realization  at  rofits m h d a th p may not  be  as  robust  s  in  the ast. nternal sh  flow  will ot  be  as  strong.  s others  ave a p I ca n A h indicated,  nancial rkets re  still  certain.  n  any  event,  usinesses  ay decide hey o  not fi ma a un I b m t d

need  to  add  to heir  apital dgets ecause nventories  e  adequate nd  export  rders  re t c bu b i ar a o a lagging.  t s his  hat    think  rings  he reenbook  home. So,  in his  essimistic  enario, e I i t t I b t G t p sc on would  say  financial  rkets  have  not  yet eturned  o ormal  liquidity  d  risk  preads,  nd  stock ma r t n an s a market  evaluations ll oon  catch p  with  the uch changed  profit tlook. wi s u m ou

Finally, e essimistic enario  nvolves  nternational cerns hat  ave  been  alluded th p sc i i con t h to  by  others.  apan, bviously  he argest onomy in  Asia, ontinues  o  be  mired  in  recession. J o t l ec c t Brazil's  onomic  performance s  likely  o e  weak. I  am concerned hat  ts  bility  efend ec i t b t i a tod against  evaluation,  re that  o  be  necessary,  imited  iven  its  eserve  osition. nally, d we t isl g r p Fi as others  ave  indicated,  ina  may not  prove o  be  as  strong  s  the urrent  fficial  mbers h Ch t a c o nu support r  suggest. o

So,  we have  these wo  scenarios.  he  question  s hich one  we believe.  f  e believe t T i w I w the  optimistic  e, bviously onetary  policy  s robably roperly  ositioned w. On the  other on o m i p p p no hand,  while t  s  not t  all    certainty,  r y money the ore pessimistic  enario  oes  seem all i i a a fo m m sc d too  possible.  f  he omestic nd  international ponents  of his  cenario  o  come to  pass,  he I t d a com t s d t consequences or he  U.S.  economy are  dire. he good  news in  some ways is hat  e do  not f t T t w have  to hoose  between  these cenarios  oday.  Fortunately,    most  measures,  nflation c s t by i is subdued  and  likely  o  stay o.  Just s  limitations   ricing  imit  orporate  pending,  hey lso t s a inp l c s t a limit  he isk  f nflation.  erefore,  s  I  think  t  least  ne  other erson as  said,  e can  afford t r o i Th a a o p h w to  buy  some insurance  t his  ime.

On the  forecast, ave  no  complaints  ith  the  Greenbook.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Meyer.

MR. MEYER. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. Let  me start f y  focusing n  what  I of b o think as  changed  and  what  has  remained he ame in  the  outlook ince he  last  eeting nd h t s s t m a particularly  nce he  intermeeting ve. First, e  second  half  ooks tronger,  th  growth  at r si t mo th l s wi o above  trend. his  reflects th  the urprise   third-quarter   and  the  general esilience   he T bo s in GDP r int spending ata.  Second,   think  he orecast ing  forward as  been  bolstered  depreciation d I t f go h by of the  dollar  nd  particularly ce ur  intermeeting ve by  the esurgence  n  equity  rices  nd a sin o mo r i p a some relaxation   financial ress.  hird,  he  announcement  of  the razil  ackage  and  some in st T t B p other evelopments  in  the nternational lm  have  added  at east    bit f  optimism  that  he orse d i rea l a o t w case  scenario  or lobal urmoil  ight  be  avoided. f g t m

What has  remained  the  same? I  think he eneral nswer  is he ualitative  recast t g a t q fo going  forward.  It till pears hat  rowth  will e  clearly  elow  trend  ext  year,  hough  some s ap t g b b n t modest  upward revision  long  the  lines  f he  Greenbook  forecast pears ustified. till a o t ap j It s appears hat  nflation  ll emain  well ontained.  nd it  till  pears hat  ownside  risks t i wi r c A s ap t d predominate hough  perhaps  less  o  than efore.   think  he ain  difference  hat  here s t s b I t m ist t i renewed  appreciation  ome upside isk  oing  forward. ofs r g

Why  so  little  ange  in he orecast?  irst, hink he  upward  revision  o  the hird ch t f F I  t t t t quarter  as concentrated  o  heavily  n nventory  nvestment  hat  t  s ore likely   be  reversed w s i i i t i i m to than  extrapolated  ing  forward. econd,  the ebound  in  equity  rices  ppears o e go S r p a t b incompatible  ith  a  forecast  lowing rowth  and  declining  rofits,  d  therefore  lso s w ofs g p an ita i likely  o e  reversed  oing orward.  Third,  hile he  depreciation   the  dollar  ertainly t b g f w t of isc a positive,  s  ffect  s ffset   some further owdown in  foreign  rowth, s  in  the  Greenbook it e i o by sl g a forecast. nally, ile  the  financial ress s  been  partially  wound,  financial nditions, Fi wh st ha un co at least  utside  f quity arkets,  ave  nevertheless gnificantly eriorated  nce uly. o o e m h si det si J

Here is ow I  would  characterize  e  broad ualitative  atures  he  outlook. irst, h th q fe oft F private  omestic emand appears o ave  decelerated   about  a  4  percent  rowth  rate  n  the d d t h to g i second  half  rom  the   percent  ate  n  the irst lf, turning   its  verage ate ver  the revious f 8 r i f ha re to a r o p two  years.  This s ery  consistent  th  the ravity  tory  hat    told arlier.  further owing n i v wi g s t I e A sl i private  omestic emand,  as  in  the reenbook  forecast,  ward  roughly   trend  ate ver  1999 d d G to a r o looks lausible.  his  partly  eflects  diminished  timulus  rom  the ealth  effect,  suming p T r a s f w as equity rices  o  not  rise  urther,  d  it  eflects,  addition,  e ffect  f he ecent  eterioration p d f an r in th e o t r d in  financial nditions ong  with  the rojected  urther rrection   equity  rices.  his  spreads co al p f co in p T the  effects  f lobal  urmoil  rom  the xternal   the omestic ector.  iven  the  slowdown in o g t f e to d s G

private  omestic emand,  even  the  slower ate f  decline  n  net xports  ver  1999 is nough  to d d r o i e o e push  overall  rowth  below trend. he slowdown is einforced er  the  next  couple f  quarters g T r ov o by  a  reduction  n  inventory vestment  rom  its  nsustainable ird-quarter  e.  I  think  t  s  also i in f u th pac i i reasonable  o  anticipate  at  rowth  will ebound  to  about rend  n  the  year 000. t th g r t i 2

I  would  put y best uess f  growth  next ear ust    shade  higher  han n  the m g o y j a t i Greenbook  forecast,  t  I  would  also ake nto ccount he  still ymmetric ownside  risk  hat bu t i a t as d t I see  to  that  aseline  n  setting netary  policy. 'm   little s ptimistic  out he ourse f b i mo I a les o ab t c o nominal  wage change  and  a  bit  ore concerned bout  the ize nd  inflationary ect  f he m a s a eff o t depreciation   the ollar  han  is he reenbook,  but   still  lieve  nflation  ll e  well of d t t G I be i wi b contained.

I  think  hat  we do at his  eeting s  a  close all.  ut  were  we to ove one  more w t m i c B m time, hich  I  would  support,  t ould  seem to  me that  hat  ould  bring o  a  conclusion  he w i w t w t t cumulative djustment  n  monetary  policy  hat  eems appropriate   light  f he iscrete ange a i t s in o t d ch in  the utlook hat  as  occurred. e  should ind ome way to  perhaps ignal  hat  s  well.  hank o t h W f s s t a T you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Kelley.

MR.  KELLEY. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. I  will at leanup ere.  The fundamental b c h worldview  of  hawks and  doves  is lways  evolving,  ut  I  do  think  hat  oth  of hose irds re a b t b t b a alive  nd  well. o oversimplify, awk's  view of olicy  oday  might  well  be  that, th  the .S. a T a  h p t wi U economy strong  nd  the  world's  inancial ructure  aky, ur  policy hould e  to nsure  hat  ur a f st sh o s b i t o financial stem  remains   rock-solid chor  to  windward.  That  is he est hing  hat  e can  do sy a an t b t t w to  help oth he  world  and  ourselves, nce  a  bias oward  firmness.   dove's  ocus ight  be  on b t he t A f m the  U.S.  economy as  the ngine  whose  forward rive s ssential    the orld's  tability e d i e to w s and

I  find uch  that  s  appealing  n oth  of  these rguments nd  I  don't  ant  to ave  to m i i b a a w h choose  one  path ver  the ther. ortunately,    e stay ocused n the  same mission hat  e o o F if w f o t w have  pursued or o  long--namely, eking aximum f s se m sustainable  owth  fostered  y  price  evel gr b l stability--I  nk  e can  reasonably  eek oth  of  those bjectives,  d  the est olicy,  s  before, thi w s b o an b p a still es  here. li t

How  do  we identify at  olicy  ath? As always, hat  omes from  assessing e isks th p p t c th r and  trying  o  determine  ow  strong  hey  are nd  where  the alance ies.    believe  he alance f t h t a b l I t b o risks  as  migrated o he  downside, articularly  it  elates   the ikely  iming f otential h t t p as r to l t o p shocks.  To be  sure,  pside isks  emain  and  could  readily sume  their  ominance  of nly ust u r r re d o j a few  months ago.  First  f  all,  f ourse,  ur  primary oncern or any quarters  ow is till th o o c o c f m n s wi us.  Economic activity   till ry  strong,  abor  arkets  are  still ry ight, d  that  eans that iss ve l m ve t an m inflation   till  major  potential reat. t  I  believe  hat  hat  cenario  s f  diminished iss a th Bu t t s i o probability  r ll f he  reasons  ith  which  we are  familiar. e good  news timing-wise  s hat fo a o t w Th i t if  e should ee  that  cenario  volving,  ts  atent sks  hould aterialize  owly nough for s  to w s s e i l ri s m sl e u have  time  to ounter  hem  if  eed  be. c t n

I  worry  more  today bout  the otential r ery  serious  ischief  hat  ould rise  n  the a p fo v m t c a i stock arket  if  t hould oom to  new highs. hat  could ut  us  in  severe eopardy  f   crash hat m i s b T p j o a t could ring own a  great eal ore of  the orld  and, ndeed,  ur  own economy with  it.  y b d d m w i o M hope  is hat,  s  a  slowing conomy results   declining rporate  arnings, is  arket  will t a e in co e th m self-correct  an  orderly  ay. However,  a  real rash as  too igh  a  probability    give e much in w c h h to m comfort,  nd  easier  olicy  ay heighten  he hances f  a  plunge n  the arket. a p m t c o i m

The downside  risks  eem to e  growing  and, erhaps f ven  more importance,  ould s b p o e c burgeon  much  more quickly,  erhaps everely  nd  without uch warning.  The international p s a m risks,  e know, certainly ve  those haracteristics.  re  could ell  be  others  et o nfold n w ha c The w y t u i this  ynamic  environment. hat  the .S.  economy is  slowing  seems  to  be  a  growing  probability. d T U While  that  ay be  desirable thin imits, ce  a  downward trend ains omentum,  it  s ard  to m wi l on g m i h know how far nd  fast  t  ay go and  what  it  ight  take o  arrest  decline  f  hat  ecomes a i m m t a i t b necessary.  n  today's  orld,    think  hat s   more than  usually  mportant  actor. I w I t i a i f

I  do  think e should eep  a  wary  eye  on  deflation. ere  are  some signs  hat  ts w k Th t i impetus  may be  slowing, ut n  the ontext f n  increasingly  uggish  .S economy,  if  hat  s b i c o a sl U t i what  should nsue, t ould  become a  real anger. e i c d

To sum up,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  do not elieve  hat  e are  behind he urve,  ut   do b t w t c b I believe  hat  he round  is  shifting.  rhaps e need  to  shift  bit  ore with  it.    see ittle  ason t t g Pe w a m I l re to  wait s  any  upside isk  ould  likely  merge  rather  lowly ver ime,  hereas  the xisting a r w e s o t w e downside  risks  ould  appear uddenly nd  soon.

A phenomenon likely  o  be  longer asting  he  firming f onditions t l ist o c on bank  loans o onfinancial rrowers.  large hare f  commercial  bank t n bo A s o respondents  o  the ovember Senior oan Officer  pinion  Survey  reported t N L O tightening andards  nd  terms  for &amp;I loans o arge-  nd  middle-market st a C t l a businesses  nd  for ommercial  real state  oans. vidence  also urfaced  n a c e l E s i that urvey f  some,  though  less ronounced, irming  f tandards  nd  terms s o p f o s a for  small usinesses.  nd large  ommercial  banks  on  balance ave  seen  an b A c h appreciable  ise  n  their  osts  f unds n apital  arkets. he staff es  not r i c o f i c m T do foresee  uch further  eterioration   redit  vailability ough anks, ut m d ofc a thr b b the  Committee  may consider  his  ossibility   nontrivial  sk  o  the t p as  a ri t economic  outlook. ertainly,  e  episode f he  early 990s  vividly C th o t 1 demonstrated  hat    credit  runch an  involve  he  banking ector  nd  that t a c c t s a aggressive  asing an  be  a  necessary  onetary  policy  esponse.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you.  Questions or avid? If ot, et  e get f D n l m started.  his  is   more difficult l  han hat  t he  last  eeting.  There  is ery  little  estion T a cal t t a t m v qu that  here as  been  considerable sing n  a  number of he reas here  we are oncerned. he t h ea i t a w c T one  area here  things  ave  eased egrettably  re than   would  have  liked  s he  stock arket. w h r mo I i t m In  a  certain  ense hat  as reated    major uestion  n  my judgment  as  to  whether e should s t h c a q i w move. If he  Dow  Jones  industrial  erage ere  200  to  300 points  ower,    think  he ase or t av w l I t c f

moving one  additional me  and  then  putting  olicy n  indefinite  ld  would  be  fairly rong  or ti p o ho st f a  number  of he  reasons hat ave  already  een  discussed  oday,  s  well s  additional es  that t t h b t a a on I would like  o  raise.    do  not hink hat  nflation  s  become a  problem; f nything,   s he t I t t i ha i a it i t reverse.    do  think he oncerns bout  an  asset  ubble re  not ithout alidity,  d  that  s here I t c a b a w v an i w I  have  my  greatest ncerns bout asing. co a e

Let  me first,  wever, ddress  he  inflation  sue.  he crucial  uestion  e have  to  ask ho a t is T q w ourselves  s ow we should easure  inflation.   e look  at he  core  CPI, t  as  clearly i h m Ifw t i h accelerated   the  last  ear  or  so  and  at he oment  is unning n  the  area f omewhat under  a in y t m r i o s 2-1/2  percent  nnual ate. n  contrast,  e ore CE has  been  decelerating  irly amatically  d a r I th c P fa dr an depending  on whether e are  using -month,  6-month, r  12-month  rolling erages,  he w 3 o av t increase  s arely ore than  1  percent.  ore than alf  f  the  difference   these easures  of i b m M h o in m core  inflation  flects  e  difference    the eights or ousing. s you  know, owners' re th in w f h A equivalent  ent s ver  20  percent f he PI and  total  ousing s lose o  30  percent,   I  recall. r i o o t C h i c t as In  the CE,  they  are  about alf  hat.  he  difference curs o  a  substantial  tent  s  a P h t T oc t ex a consequence f  two  elements. irst,  e eight  in  the PI is ased  on  individuals'  ews  of  the o F th w C b vi potential  ntal  alue f he  houses  in  which  they ive. n  the CE, it  s erived rom  more re v o t l I P i d f detailed cro data.  Second, he  scope  of he CE  is uch broader n  that t  overs   much ma t t P m i i c a wider  area f onsumer  expenditures  nd  obviously,  ther  hings  qual hat  ould  lower  the o c a o t e t w weight or ousing  in  the  PCE. So  even  though  the  actual  rice  hanges  for ousing nd  owners' f h p c h a equivalent nt re  close  n  both  the CE  and  the PI,  the ere difference   the eights nd  the re a i P C m in w a fact hat  ousing osts re  rising  aster an  average as  created    very ramatic idening  in  the t h c a f th h a d w spread etween  CPI core nflation  d  PCE  core nflation, ch  now is b i an i whi 1-1/2 percentage  oints. p

I  seriously estion  hether  housing hould e  a  component  of  any  measure  of qu w s b underlying  nflation.  on't  ant  to  get oo nvolved  n  this, t   think  ll  he ther easures i I  d w t i i bu I a t o m that  e are  looking t--the I, he ntermediate  ices, e ommodity prices, e ata rom  the w a PP t i pr th c th d f purchasing  anagers--are  ll uggesting,   my judgment, hat  he  inflation  te  s till lling. m a s in t t ra i s fa To put  it nother  ay,  the eal unds ate  s ising. a w r f r i r

When  we look  at  the nit  ost tructure r onfinancial rporations,  ich  I  have u c s fo n co wh discussed  n  numerous  occasions  efore,  e get  a  similar ory.  verage  hourly ompensation o b w st A c for  that  ector, d  that  easure  is ore relevant an  the CI for he  analysis  nit osts,  as s an m m h E t ofu c h accelerated mewhat but  so  has  output er our  for onfinancial rporations. e so p h n co Th consequence  is hat  nit abor  osts  ave  been  rising  t  a  rate  f ess han t u l c h a o l t 1-1/2 percent  n  recent i quarters  nd  total  nit  osts, ich  include  eclining  nit  onlabor osts,  ave  been  increasing a u c wh d u n c h at a  shade  above 1 ercent. ith  corporate  rices enerally  table, is  mplies    decline  n rofit p W p g s th i a i p margins.  Indeed,  he rofit rgin  for he onfinancial rporate  ector  as  been  declining er t p ma t n co s h ov the  past ear. y

The importance f  these ata,  s  best   can  judge,  s hat hey uggest nderlying o d a I i t t s u inflationary ces re  continuing  o ecede espite  he  tightness   labor  arkets.  I  would  point for a t r d t in m out  that  here  s ery ittle  idence hat  hose arkets  are ightening rther  his  ime,  ut t i v l ev t t m t fu att t b I also ould  not ant  to rgue  that  e are eeing ny  significant  bor  arket  easing. he w w a w s a la m T measure  that    have  found  most  useful  ecently   measuring he  degree f abor arket I r in t o l m tightness,  e  sum of hose ho  are nemployed and  those ho are ot  in  the  labor  orce ut th t w u w n f b would like    job,  ell  uite  apidly  rom 1995  through 997 but  stabilized  the eginning f his a f q r f 1 at b o t year  and  since hen as  moved hardly t  all. n  addition, e  diffusion dexes  n  the ayroll t h a I th in i p

employment series  re  clearly  alling ry  sharply, ggesting  hat  he ecent  lowdown has  been a f ve su t t r s widespread  across  ndustries. i

In  any  event,  t  s he ase hat  he rice  ressures d  the  wage pressures  re ot i i t c t t p p an a n behaving  the ay they  have  in  the ast nder omparable ircumstances.  omething  different w p u c c S is going  on. It s his  verall  ownward pressure, ich  I  think  s oming  to  a  great  xtent  rom i t o d wh i c e f international ces,  hat  learly s  undercut  o  a  substantial  tent  he ricing  ower  of for t c ha t ex t p p manufacturing  ndustries.   you know,  these rices  ave  been  weakening  quite  easurably n i As p h m i recent  onths. m

I  think  he ressure  n  profit rgins  is eginning  o  affect  apital vestment.  any t p o ma b t c in M of  the ompany executives  o  whom  I  speak  and  much of  the econdary nformation at    pick c t s i th I up  from  a  number of  different  mpany sources  learly  ndicate at  here  s  a  scaling  ack  of co c i th t i b capital  ppropriations.   s ot ery  large  s  yet,  ut  obviously  omething s ery  gradually a Iti n v a b s i v exerting  ownward pressure.  he underlying  iminished  rowth, hich  I  think s undamentally d T d g w i f being  caused  by  the queeze n  margins, as  not  yet hown up  in  the  consumer  areas,  s  best s o h s a I can  judge. onsumer markets  continue  o  be  strong, d  the ealth  effect s  not  yet ad  a C t an w ha h measurable amping effect.  otor  vehicle  ales,  hich  were  sharply  igher  n  October  largely d M s w h i because  of ncentives,  ve  eased ome this  onth,  as  Mike Moskow  indicated. ficials om i ha s m Of fr the  auto  companies  whom  we talked  o he ther  ay  all uggested  hat  ales  re unning elow t t o d s t s a r b expectations,  t  I  think  heir  xpectations e  probably  uite  igh.  Having  said ll hat,  think bu t e ar q h a t I the  likelihood at  onsumer  spending ill ontinue  o  grow rapidly  s omewhat questionable. th c w c t i s We  do  have  a  continued  igh  level  f  housing ales;    see o  real vidence hat hey re h o s I n e t t a deteriorating,    there  lso s o  evidence f   pickup.  There  has  been  some backing p  of but a i n o a u inventories.

There  also s he road  and  very mportant  uestion  f he  financial sues.  t ertainly i t b i q o t is I c is he  case hat  ield  preads nd  risk  version, ich  had  been  quite  ubstantial  rough ctober t t y s a a wh s th O and  have  eased uite  easurably  in  the  last  everal  eeks,  have  stopped asing.  n  fact, ere q m s w e I th actually  as  been  some minor  upturn,  specially    commercial  paper,  nd  I ave  run  into he h e on a h t same issues  hat  ill  cDonough t B M has  raised  ith espect  o  year-end  ffects.  think  e are w r t e I w beginning  o  see  some potential  ar-end ffects erging  in  the anking rea. o be  sure,  he t ye e em b a T t weakening  in  the vailability unds  in  the apital rkets  has  spilled er  into he ommercial a of  f c ma ov t c banking  sector, d  we have  seen  a very ramatic cceleration   C&amp;I and  other  ending an d a of l generally.   number of  banks  are  quite  nhappy about aving  to  accommodate this dditional A u h a loan  demand largely  ecause,  s  you know,  they ave  backup  lines  n commercial aper hat b a h o p t were issued nd  priced n  the  assumption hat  he  lines  ould  never e  used.  If ou speak  to a o t t w b y banks, specially e  money center  anks, t s y no  means clear  hat  hey  are  eager o e th b i i b t t t accommodate the  spillover    loan  demand from  the apital rkets. s a  consequence,   hink in c ma A It the  presumption  hat  e are  going  to  see   gradual  eturn  o ull  nd  fluid  apital rkets s nly t w a r t f a c ma i o a  hope  at his tage nd  a  hope  that    don't  hink  s bout o aterialize  ry  quickly. t s a I t i a t m ve

I  must  say hat  he isks  n  the razil  ituation  e ignificant.  e  meeting  that t t r i B s ar s Th occurred esterday  n  New  York seemed  to  suggest hat  he merican  banks  were  going  to  be y i t t A helpful  n  stabilizing zil's  nding. aving  spoken  to  a  number of hem  fairly cently, i Bra fu H t re I have  the mpression  hat  ach  will articipate  ly f  veryone lse oes.

One might  wonder  why those f s  who have e wit o u talked  bout ear-end ressures  ould  find ymmetry appropriate. e  reason   do  is hat  f  e a y p w s Th I t i w have  severe ear-end  ressures  nd  have  to  react,  he eed  would  be so  obvious hat  here ould y p a t n t t w not  be  a  whole  lot  f ebate.   am hopeful hat  hat  ill ot e  necessary.  herefore,  think o d I t t w n b T I symmetry  is he ight  nswer. t r a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  roaddus. B

MR.  BROADDUS. Mr.  Chairman,   agree ith  you  that  his  s  tough  call  ut  let  e I w t i a b m just  et he ther oint f  view  on  the able.  s I  see t fter  istening    all f his, ere  re  two g t o p o t A i a l to o t th a principal guments  for asing olicy  oday.  One is  the ownside  risks  n  the conomy,  the ar e p t d i e possibility t  he  actual  utcome  will e  weaker  than  the  Greenbook  projection.  e other  s ha t o b Th i the  need  to  act o  prevent    reemergence f he xtreme isk  version  f   few weeks ago.  I ust t a o t e r a o a j respectfully    not elieve  hat  ither  f hose wo  arguments s ery  compelling  oday.  They do b t e o t t i v t may be  compelling   few weeks down the oad  but ot  today.  It eems  to e that  ecent a r n s m r developments  and  a  lot hat  e have  heard  around  the able  his  orning  suggest  hat  rowth t w t t m t g may decelerate   trend ather  han  below  trend s  in  the reenbook. to r t a G

On the  other  oint,  t eems  to  me that  he inancial stem  is djusting,    a  number of p i s t f sy a as people  have  said,  nd  working  reasonably  ell.  In  a  situation  ke his, ere  s lways  a a w li t th i a tremendous  bias nd  pressure  n  the ed  to  do something. ut  I  would  point  ut  that  e are a o F B o w already  oing  something ven  if  e don't  educe he  funds  rate  oday. ust iven he  way we d e w r t t J g t

operate,  e are  providing  dditional quidity    meet  the dditional mand for t  nd  at   50 w a li to a de i a a basis  oint ower  price  han hat iquidity  s being rovided ust    few weeks ago. p l t t l wa p j a

One other oint    would  make is hat   ee  some risk  n  moving  today ecause t s p I t Is i b i i always  difficult   ighten  onetary  policy. ith all espect,  think  t  ight  be  difficult tot m W r I i m to change  our  policy ourse nd  it  ight  be  hard o  do  it  s  quickly  s  we would  like.  iven  all f c a m t a a G o that,    would  have  a  strong  reference  or lternative I p f a B.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Ferguson.

MR.  FERGUSON. Mr.  Chairman,  I  support  oth alves f  your  recommendation.  I b h o believe  hat  e have  achieved uch of ur  goals rom  the  two  earlier licy  asings. redit t w m o f po e C market  conditions ve  improved  but  are robably ot  normal.  Just o  follow p  on  what ha p n t u President  roaddus  had  to  say, ome may ask  why we should ot  wait ntil  ecember,  given  the B s n u D possibility  further  mprovement.  My  answer  to  that  uestion  s hat  f  e do  not ake his of i q i t i w t t opportunity   complete ur  work,  we risk  osing  he dvantage hat  e have  now. I  am to o l t a t w concerned hat  f  e do  not  act,  he  markets ay return  o heir  ery  disturbed ate  f   few t i w t m t t v st o a weeks ago.  That  would  then  require  s  to djust  olicy, rhaps y  larger  mounts  and  perhaps u a p pe b a again  in  an  intermeeting ve. If ontrary  o  my expectation,  e asing roves o  be  premature, mo c t th e p t I  do  think  e can  undo  it.   believe  he ove to  symmetry  is n  important  nternal gnal  hat  e w I t m a i si t w are  prepared o  go  either  ay if  he acts  o  indicate. at  is hy I  support ymmetry as  well. t w t f s Th w s

Finally,    you  have  pointed  ut, iven he irection   inflation, perhaps ave as o g t d of we h tightened  assively.  he  tightening s appropriate rlier   the  year,  ut  I  am now in  favor f p T wa ea in b o the  proposed asing nd  moving to  symmetry. e a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  inehan. M

MS. MINEHAN. As I  noted n  my earlier  mments,  after    difficult ancing i co a bal process  n  thinking  bout his, ame to  this  eeting learly  n  favor f  waiting  o  see  what i a t I  c m c i o t happens  for he  rest  f his  uarter  nd  considering  possible  ove in  December. I  have  listened t o t q a a m very  carefully    all f he  arguments.  I  do  believe  hat  e face ome risks  hat  elate  o he to o t t w s t r t t ebullience  n  the tock arket  and  the  feedback rom  rising  evels  f  stock arket rices  nto i s m f l o m p i consumer  confidence  nd  spending. ooner  or  later,  at  s oing  to  come to  a  halt.    think  e a S th i g I w are  all  n  agreement n  that.  he prospects r rofit rgins ust  re  not  where  they ere  earlier i o T fo p ma j a w in  this  ycle. ooner  or ater,  ason s oing o  prevail.  overnor  Kelley's mments earlier c S l re i g t G co on that  opic  ere  right  long he  line  f y thinking.  f  he tock arket oes  not o  a whole  lot t w a t o m I t s m d g higher,  e are  better  ff han f  t oes  because  eventually e ise  ill ome to  a  halt nd  the w o t i i d th r w c a overall  mpact n  the conomy will e  worse  at  that  ime.  So,  I  think  hat  s ne  of he isks  e i o e b t t i o t r w face  if  e move  at   time hen a lot f he asic ignals  rom  the omestic conomy,  the eal w a w o t b s f d e r economy,  are  showing  resilience   ot trength, ich  almost verybody  has  commented on. ifn s wh e

I  also hink  hat  lmost verything  hat  as  happened  since ur  last  onetary  policy t t a e t h o m move--the  intermeeting se  that    think  as extremely  ell  done  in  the ense f  getting  he ea I w w s o t markets  to unction  etter  han hey ere--has een  on  the  positive de. t eems  a  little  range f b t t w b si I s st at his  oint  o  be  thinking out  a  further sing f olicy gainst    lot f he ositive t p t ab ea o p a a o t p developments,  lthough ll f  them  involve    significant  gree f ownside  risk.    see  a  process a a o a de o d I where  easing  ow  creates    risk  n he hort  erm  that  hings  ould et  little ond  us. n a i t s t t c g a bey Whereas over  the onger erm, f  he  slowdown in  the xpansion ccurs nd  if inancial l t i t e o a f conditions  urn ore negative  han  we expect,  e might  see  more of   downward ratcheting t m t w a of the  economy than  if  e had  not oved. w m

Those are  my basic oncerns. y  thinking  s ore in  line ith  that  f resident c M i m w o P Broaddus, ut  I  am not oing  to  dissent  ecause   think t's lose all.  he  people ho are b g b I i a  c c T w closer  o  the arkets han   are  worried bout ear-end inancing  nd  overall  ragility t m t I a y f a f and uncertainty,  d  I  know that  as  been  factored  nto our hinking  s  well,  r.  Chairman.  There an h i y t a M is omething  to  be  listened  here,  o  I  will upport  our roposal  o ase, ut   am nervous s tot s s y p t e b I about  it.

MR. MOSKOW. Mr.  Chairman,  as  I  mentioned n  my comments,  I hink  he  risks i t t clearly  re  on  the  downside.

MR.  POOLE. Mr.  Chairman,  I  will upport our  recommendation, ut  with s y b considerable luctance.  think his  s  another  xample  where  immediate  disclosure   our re I t i e of decision  n  symmetry would  be  very  useful  o  us  in  terms f roviding    signal  o he  markets. o t o p a t t I fear hat  he  markets ill nterpret  is  djustment  s  another  n  a  string  f asing ctions  et o t t w i th a a i o e a y t come. I  would  hope  that  long he  way in  coming weeks,  when the ime eems  appropriate d a t t s an the  market  tone eems  acceptable, u could ndicate   the arket  that  t  ooks s  if ur asing s yo i to m i l a o e is inished  or he ime  being,  hatever s  the ight  ay to  do  that.    think his  s   case here f f t t w i r w I t i a w disclosure uld help he  Committee. wo t

I  am concerned hat  e are ouring asoline  ather  han  water nto his  conomy. The t w p g r t o t e fact hat  he rowth  of oney is  unexplained  s ot  a  great  omfort o  me. It ould  help f  e t t g m i n c t w i w could  explain hat  is oing  on  by  pointing  o ome statistical  malies,  o ome institutional w g t s ano t s changes, o  money going  abroad,  r o  whatever, ut  the act  s e cannot ome up  with  any t o t b f i w c good  explanation.    fear  e may be  pouring   great  eal  of iquidity  to  n  economy that  s I w a d l in a i bound  to  be  slowing nyway for he  reasons  hat    talked  bout arlier. e economy currently a t t I a e Th is
