CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Would someone like  o  second  that  omination? t n SPEAKER(?). Second.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without  objection.  et  us  move on  to r.  Fisher.  eter. L M P

MR. FISHER.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. I  will  e  referring    the b to several  ages  of olored  harts  istributed  is  orning. p c c d th m 1

In  reviewing ecent  arket  developments,    will ry  o  describe  hat  I r m I t t w see  as he auses f he  recent, rupt epricing d  volatility quity, t c o t ab r an of  e bond, nd  currency alues. a v

First, nce our  last  eeting, here  ave  been  noteworthy hifts   the si y m t h s in interest  te utlook or he  United  States, rmany, and  Japan.  While  each ra o f t Ge of hese ovements may appear mall,  n  perspective d  in  conjunction t m s i an they  can  be  understood  s  causing    significant rease  n isk  o hich a a inc i r t w market  participants  sponded. re

Second,  to  my way of hinking,    s  not elpful  o  view  the ollar's t it i h t d movement--or  exchange  rate ovements generally--as  ausing"  he  sellm "c t off n  bond  and  equity  arkets. he dollar's  cent  ovements appear o i m T re m t reflect e ame reassessment  f he  outlook  hat  as  affected  ther arkets. th s o t t h o m

Third,    think  he ecent  olatility arkets an, n art,  e  attributed I t r v in  m c i p b to  the ifficulty  l  arket  participants   having n oming to  grips  ith d al m are i c w the  extraordinary  rformance f  the .S.  economy. In  this  ense,  he pe o U s t recent  olatility lects  e  contest  etween  "old" nd  "new" paradigms. v ref th b a

Looking  at he  first ge  of harts, ich  depicts  orward ate t pa c wh f r agreements nd  Euro-deposit tes  rom  August  1996  for he  dollar, e a ra f t th mark,  and  the en,  you  can  see  the acking p  of he -by-12 ollar  RA-y b u t 9 d F indicating  ree-month eposit  ates, ne  months  forward--which  ccurred th d r ni o following  he  August  1st  release  f he onfarm  payroll  ata nd  the APM t o t n d a N survey.  In  the lue ines, u  can  see  the onsistent se  n  German forward b l yo c ri i rates  rom  mid-July. t  the ottom, ou  can  see  the ecent,  ontinued f A b y r c decline  n apanese orward  rates. i J f

The rally  n  U.S.  interest  te arkets,  hich  started  he  spring, i ra m w int continued  n he  last  wo  weeks of uly. hat  rally  as  propelled  y  the i t t J T w b combination f  reduced xpectations r ny near-term  ommittee action o e fo a C following  he  Chairman's umphrey-Hawkins testimony  nd  expectations t H a for educed  Treasury ssuance  s  a  consequence f he  improved  fiscal r i a o t outlook.

The August  1st  release  f he onfarm  payroll  nd  NAPM o t n a reports caused  a  modest  increase  n  expectations r   tightening   the ommittee i fo a by C before ear-end,  ith  the ecember Fed  funds  futures  acking p  by 14 y w D b u basis  oints  n  six ays.  As you can  see n he RA  chart, te  ast  eek the p i d i t F la l w backup  in  interest  tes  eversed  t he ime  of he apid ecline  n  equity ra r a t t t r d i markets.  But  through ast  ednesday's lose,  he  9-by-12 acked  up  by  32 l W c t b basis  oints  n  the ine rading  ays  from  July  1 p i n t d 3 st .

Looking  back  across he  past  ear,  his  ove is omparable o  the t y t m c t increases  n he  9-by-12 hat ccurred  n  December and  February. n i t t o i I December,  beginning   few  days  before he hairman's peech t  the a t C s a American Enterprise stitute,   9-by-12 acked  up  by 30  basis  oints  n In the b p i thirteen ading  ays; n  response  o  the hairman's umphrey-Hawkins tr d i t C H

testimony  n  February,  he -by-12 acked  up  by  28  basis  oints  n ust  ix i t 9 b p i j s trading  ays. d

Trend  reversals ch  as  these,  eflecting  ly  a  modest  increase  n he su r on i t probability    a  tightening  onetary  policy, so end o  cause  market of ofm al t t participants  reassess  he ikely  onsequences f till emingly emote to t l c o s se r events. ost  market  participants  ill ink hat  n  increase  n  rates  y  the M st th t a i b Committee is ot  likely  o ccur t  this  eeting  or he ext. ut  given  the n t o a m t n B lofty  evels  o hich  bond  and  equity  arkets ad  traded, en  a  small l t w m h ev increase  n he  likelihood  n  event hich  could  have  such  extreme, i t ofa w negative  onsequences or sset  alues auses raders  o educe heir c f a v c t t r t exposures.

To put  the ame thought  ifferently:  hose till  rking  in  the old s d fort s wo " paradigm," ncertainty emia  were  squeezed  awfully  ight  y  the nd  of u pr t b e July,  hen the  two-year reasury ield  raded ithin 5 basis  oints f he w T y t w 2 p o t Fed  funds  target te;  ome backup  in  interest  tes  nd  a  collateral  lloff ra s ra a se in  equities re  accidents  aiting  o appen.  In  conjunction th  the we w t h wi reversal  f he  U.S.  rate  utlook,  fter e ark  began  to  weaken sharply  n o t o a th m i mid-July arket  participants  so ave  had  to  respond o  the scalating m al h t e rhetoric  rom  Bundesbank  officials  reatening    increase  n  rates. f th an i

On July 4 t h 2 , he  Bundesbank  Council et  and  announced  that  heir t m t repo  operations uld  continue  t  the ixed ate f  percent  ut  only  for wo a f r o 3 b the  first o  weeks  of heir  our-week oliday  ntil  he ext ouncil tw t f h u t n C meeting.  This  suggested  hat  he undesbank  Directorium  ould  have  the t t B w opportunity   change  the epo  rate y  either  oving to   variable  ate to r b m a r tender r  raising  he ixed  ate ast  eek. However,  they nnounced  one o t f r l w a more operation  t he  fixed   percent  ate  ast  eek,  and  this  orning  they a t 3 r l w m announced  one  more  operation  t  3  percent. a

From the  Bundesbank's erspective,  is  aber attling  s  had  two p th s r ha beneficial fects:  as  created    much greater  ense f wo-way risk  n  the ef Ith a s o t i Deutsche  mark and itself    the re-monetary nion nvironment. in p u e

Now, the  Bundesbank faces omething f   dilemma--or    couple f s o a a o dilemmas.  First, e erman economy is roviding  ixed  signals: me th G p m so measures  of  activity  e icking p  and, s  a  consequence f he ecline  n ar p u a o t d i the ark this  ear,  fficials  pect mport rice  nflation   egin  to  show m y o ex i p i tob up  in he ata. n the ther and, igh  unemployment continues;  ngoing t d O o h h o problems  in  implementing ax eform  suggest  hat  onsumption  demand t r t c will emain  weak,  and  M3  growth  continues  o  slow.  Thus, n  strictly r t o domestic rounds,   decision  o ncrease  ates  ould  be  finely  alanced. g a t i r w b

Second,  it  s ot lear  ow markets  would  respond o  a  rate  ncrease  n i n c h t i i the  context  f uropean  monetary  union. o the xtent  hat  n  increase o E T e t a in rates  y  the undesbank  were  to e  perceived  s  hostile   the MU b B b a to E process,  ausing elay  or  postponement r  a  narrowing f he  field  f ikely c d o o t o l member countries,   ight  then  be  expected o  cause he ark  to it m t t m strengthen.

However,  much of he  Bundesbank's hetoric  f  the ast  ew weeks has t r o l f been  in ervice  o  the dea hat  n  increase  n ates  ould  be  consistent  th s t i t a i r w wi and  supportive  f MU,  suggesting  hat  uropean  monetary  policy  hould o E t E s not  be  frozen n lace ntil  he CB  is reated  nd  that  he onvergence i p u t E c a t c process ould  be  completed y German rates  ising   meet  Italian tes. c b r to ra To the  extent  hat  arket articipants  lieve  his,   the vent hat  he t m p be t in e t t Bundesbank were  to  raise  ates,   s ot  clear  hat  erman long-term  ates r it i n t G r would move very  much,  or  that  he ark would  appreciate ch more  than t m mu it id  last  eek. d w

Japanese orward  rates  eflect e  continued  nwinding  of xpectations f r th u e for ny  near-term  irming y  the  Bank of apan,  articularly lowing  he a f b J p fol t July 4 2 t h release  f he  Bank of apan's  uarterly  eport nd  the  July 0 th o t J Q R a 3 release  f eaker-than-expected  ne  industrial  oduction  ata. s you o w Ju pr d A can  see  at he ottom  of he age, he ise  n  rates  hat  ccurred  n  May--in t b t p t r i t o i response o  official  onouncements  that  hings  ere  not s  bad  as  they t pr t w a seemed--has ow been  completely  eversed  s  market articipants  ve n r a p ha come to  see  the apanese conomy to e  as  weak as  they riginally  ared. J e b o fe

The 9-by-12 orward ate s  now returning   the evels  here  it as f r i to l w w trading  n  March,  at he nd  of he ast  apanese iscal ar hen gloom i t e t l J f ye w was widespread. n August  15 t h  and  again oday,  he ield  n  the O t t y o benchmark  No. 182 Japanese overnment  bond  hit    new,  historic w  of g a lo 2.065  percent.

Turning  to he  next age,   further lt   the lobal utlook  as  come t p a jo to g o h in  the ush f urrency evaluations   Southeast  sia.  Over  the ourse f r o c d in A c o the  spring  nd  summer,  media  attention s  shifted  ack  and  forth  etween a ha b b describing  hese vents s  "speculative  tacks"  n the ne  hand  and t e a at o o "competitive valuations"  the  other. ncreasingly,  phasis  is ow de on I em n placed n  the  latter.  ile  much of he ocus as  been  on  the evaluation o Wh t f h d of  these urrencies ainst  he ollar, own in  the op  panel,  heir  eclines c ag t d sh t t d against  he en  since ay t y M 1 st have  been  even  more impressive, ich  is ot wh n likely  o  do  much to mprove  the  outlook or he apanese xport ector. t i f t J e s

Turning  to  the hird  age  of harts-t p c

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Peter,  ay I  interrupt  u for   moment?  Would m yo a you  remind  everybody  what  a  3-by-6,    6-by-9,  nd  a  9-by-12 re? a a a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It s ot  a  question  f reminding!"  What are  they? i n o " [Laughter]  Let  me put t his  ay:  I  have  never eard hat  erm  except s  used  by you  in his  oom. i t w h t t a t r

MR.  FISHER.  All  right.  s I  mentioned  at he utset, aughter]  9-by-12 s he A t o [l a i t 3-month  rate  raded   months  forward. o,  9  plus  is  12-t 9 S 3

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Now, stop!  [Laughter]  The arithmetic  asy,  ut  why ise b don't  ou  use  English?  This s arket argon hose use  is estricted    a  very  few  acres y i m j w r to surrounding  our  office  n  New  York. y i

MR. FISHER.  I  think  he  new technology  s preading  t  ut  all he ay to  New  Jersey t i s i o t w and  Westchester!  he 3-by-6  is he -month  rate s  it  rades    months  forward. T t 3 a t 3

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Why  didn't u  say  so? yo

MR. FISHER.  Where were  we?  [Laughter] s I  mentioned  at  the A outset,  do  not hink t  s elpful  o  see  exchange  rate  ovements I t i i h t m generally,   the  dollar's  vements in  particular, n  exogenous  "cause" or mo as  a of ond  and  equity  arket  volatility. her,    think hat  xchange  markets b m Rat I t e have  been  responding  o  the ame shift   outlook  hat  as  influenced her t s in t h ot markets.

In  the irst nel  you  can  see  the ollar's  vements against  he ark, f pa d mo t m in  blue,  nd  against  he en, n  red, ince ay  1 . In  July,  he ollar llied a t y i s M st t d ra sharply gainst  he ark as  the dea f  a  broad  and  timely MU a t m i o E process became generally  ccepted.  he dollar  ame off  gainst  he  mark  in  early a T c a t August  when the  Bundesbank  worked hard o  suggest he isk  f  upward t t r o movement in  German rates;  s  these isks  eclined, e  dollar  as  jumped a r d th h back  up  a  bit  gainst  he ark in he ast  ew  days.  The dollar  ppreciated a t m t l f a modestly  against  he en  in uly s  the apanese utlook  eteriorated  d t y J a J o d an recently  as  been  more  stable  gainst  he en  than gainst  he ark. h a t y a t m Looking  at he ovements in ond and  equity  arkets,  epicted  n  the t m b m d i second  and  third  anels,    see  a  case f orrelation   heir sponses  o p I o c int re t common  impulses,  ot  causation. n

Finally, st  s  members of he  Committee  have  been  surprised   the ju a t by performance f he  United  States  conomy in  sustaining  w  inflation  d o t e lo an

relatively  rong ctivity,    too  have  market  participants. prises--even st a so Sur pleasant  nes, ike he ombination f ast  ednesday's  PPI  and  retail les o l t c o l W sa releases--tend reate  ncertainty,  d  uncertainty  eds  to  be  priced  nto to  c u an ne i markets.

Another  way to  view  this, picted  n  the  fourth  age, s s  a  contest de o p i a between  the ld  and  new paradigms  and, pecifically,  ng the iverse o s amo d views  now being  expressed  n  market  behavior.  Old  paradigm  pessimists" i " think hat  nflation   bout  to  break ut; t as ust  een  hiding n  the ags. t i isa o i h j b i l They think  he  Fed  is behind he  curve,"  roviding  oo uch liquidity. t " t p t m In response o  last  ednesday's  data,  ld  paradigm essimists uld  be t W o p wo inclined  o  sell  tocks nd  bonds  short. t s a

"Old  paradigm  optimists" ink nflation   robably  oming soon, ut th i isp c b it's  rd  to ell.  hey think  he ed  is oing  a  good  job nd  that  aybe this ha t T t F d a m benign  inflation  havior  an  be  kept oing or   few more quarters.  any be c g f a M old  paradigm  optimists e eformed  old aradigm  pessimists,  ose ar r p wh pessimism  became too  expensive   few  thousand ow  points  go.  Thus, a D a they  remain  cautious: ying  stocks nd  bonds  on  dips nd  selling em  on bu a a th rallies.

"New  paradigm  optimists"--who  ve  done  rather  ell ver  the ast ha w o p year  or  so--think at  e have  entered    new era n hich  productivity th w a i w growth, idden  in  the acro data,  s aming  inflation.  ey think  he ed is h m i t Th t F doing  a  great  ob nd  are reat  dmirers f he  Chairman.  In  response  o j a g a o t t low  inflation  d  strong  ctivity, y o  what  they  always  do:  buy  loads f an a the d o stocks nd  some bonds  whenever  they an. a c

"New paradigm  pessimists"  e  only  recently tting  he  attention  ey ar ge t th think hey  deserve.  he lack f  corporate  ricing  ower,  the t T o p p industrialization ina, he  chronic eakness  of apan  and  Europe, he of  Ch t w J t competitive  evaluations  f he  United  Kingdom  and  Italy    few  years go d o t a a and, ow,  of  all f outheast  sia, re igns f he  coming global  apacity n o S A a s o t c glut. hey think  he ed  is uch too  tight.  hey  look t he PI  and  retail T t F m T a t P sales  ata nd  see  deflation aring em  in he  face nd  the ast  asp  of he d a st th t a l g t U.S.  consumer  before he  deflationary  ality  nks n; hey,  herefore,  ll t re si i t t se stocks nd  buy  Treasuries--not porate  onds, ust  reasuries. a cor b j T

While  some of he  recent  olatility   perhaps e  attributed   hin, t v can b tot August  markets,  s  I  see t  he olatility lso   consequence f he a i t v is  a a o t interaction   hese our rchetypes'  iverse  esponses  o he  same data nd oft f a d r t t a of  the ovement of arket  participants  ong these our ypes. uch of m m am f t M the  rally  f his  ear an  be  thought f s  having een  propelled  y  the o t y c o a b b migration  f  old aradigm  pessimists   old  paradigm  optimists d  of ld o p to an o paradigm  optimists   new paradigm  optimists. ch  of he ecent to Mu t r

Turning  to  domestic perations, serve  eeds  were  somewhat more o re n moderate  than  in receding  ntermeeting riods  nd  we tended o  use p i pe a t shorter-term erations  o  meet  those eeds.  The  next age  of harts op t n p c contrasts e  volatility ed  funds  trading  nd  operating  alances  n th of  F a b i comparable  periods  rom  last  ummer  and  this  ummer. The daily  ange  of f s s r Fed  funds  trading   shown in  blue; he ne-standard  eviation  f unds is t o d o f trading  round  the aily  ffective  te  nd  the ffective te  re  depicted  n a d e ra a e ra a i red; elow  each  is   bar hart  howing  daily  perating  alances.  t b a c s o b A discernibly wer  levels  f perating  alances  his  ear  as  compared to  last, lo o o b t y we have  actually d  modestly ess olatility he  funds  rate,   measured ha l v in  t as both  by  the ange nd  by  the  standard  eviation. r a d

Mr.  Chairman,  we had  no  foreign  xchange  intervention  erations e op during he  period.  ommittee members have  received  aterials scribing t C m de how we intend  o  manage the iversification    small ortion  f he t d of  a p o t System's eutsche  mark holdings  nto   sub-portfolio   onger-dated D i a ofl German government  securities, ch  the  Committee  approved  in  principle whi last  eptember.

MR. FISHER.  It s ertainly rthy  of ote.  I  do  not  have  an  exact ead his  orning, i c wo n r t m but  the orward  exchange  rates  ave  backed  up  quite    bit  n he ast  0 days.

MR. TRUMAN. I  think here  re  two  points  o e  made.

of estoring nfidence  nd  the tability   he aht.  The  Treasury's sition sically s  to r co a s oft b po ba wa encourage he  Thais o  engage  with he  International etary  Fund,  which  has  a  traditional w t t t Mon vie on  these ypes f hings,  nd  to  urge  the apanese o  restrain  om  pouring oney into hailand t o t a J t fr m T until  he hais  had  fully  rranged  heir  oan rom  the nternational etary  Fund.

MR. MCTEER. Ted,  in he exican bailout,   gave  them  money to  refinance  heir t M we t tesobonos,  heir  ollar-guaranteed t.  What is he  money being  loaned o  Thailand o e  used t d deb t t t b for?

MR. TRUMAN. You can  use  the ord "bailout,"  t  I  am not  allowed o. he w bu t T financial tuation    Thailand s n  some respects  uch more problematical an as the  case n si in i i m th w i Mexico. They have  something  on  the rder f 38 billion   short-term ligations.  st are ank o o $ in ob Mo b obligations,   hich  more than  half  re  to apanese anks.  They also ave  a  very  large orward ofw a J b h f position  hat  s pproximately  qual  to heir  ross eserves.  he amount  of oney being  put  up, t i a e t g r T m about 16 billion,   elatively  all.  If  e net ut  the orward osition ainst  he  foreign $ isr sm w o f p ag t exchange  reserves, eir  eserves  osition  o better an  Mexico's as. In  a  sense hey re th r p isn th w t a getting  ome $16 billion    this  ackage  against  40  billion  hort-term ligations,  ich  are s in p $ ofs ob wh mostly rivate-sector ts. n  that ense he  whole  program  is redicated  the ssumption f p deb I s t p on a o credibility her  han  a  bailout  ecause he oney is ot ufficient    allow  all  hese hort-term rat t b t m n s to t s lines  o un  off. n he exican case, e had  a  package  of lose o  $40  billion ainst  ssentially t r I t M w c t ag e $40  billion  hort-term nk  obligations  d  tesobonos.  e  tend o  forget  hat  here  ere  a  lot  f ofs ba an W t t t w o

bank  obligations    the exican  case, ut  they ere as  vulnerable   the esobono roblem.  In  fact, in M b w as t p in  the hort  un  Mexico did  lose ome dollars  hrough he anking  system,  ut hey ecovered  uite s r s t t b b t r q quickly. o,  in  that  ense hat  inancing  ackage  was  less  roblematic. S s t f p p

Two elements f oral  hazard re  involved  n  this  ase.  One has  to o  with  the eople o m a i c d p on  Peter's reage ho conduct heir  usiness, t  do  not  book  their  ositions,    that  creage. ac w t b bu p on a They are  on the ther ide f  many,  but  not  all,  f he orward iabilities  he ank of hailand. o s o o t f l of t B T You could  say  that  he ystem  is inancing  he hai  central  ank's  bility   meet  its  ommitments. t s f t T b a to c It ould be  a  tricky  usiness  f  he hais ere  to  start   default   their  oreign  xchange w b i t T w o on f e contracts.  ould  change  the ature f he usiness.  he second  element s   little  re Itw n o t b T i a mo conventional.  t as  to  do  with hat  should e  done  with  the bligations  anks  in  Thailand. he I h w b o ofb T Thai  central  ank  already  as  expended  16 billion--that's  ht,  ot ollars--to l  ut  domestic b h in  ba n d bai o institutions  se operations ve  now been  suspended.  hey have  been  quite  uccessful who ha T s in sterilizing   ut t as  become in ffect  n  obligation  he hai  government  as  a  whole. It ould it, b i h e a oft T w be  one  thing o tiff  ndholders  nd  still  other o  stiff  mmercial  banks  that  ight  be  expected t s bo a an t co m to  come in  and  help upport  he  Thai  financial stem  as  a  whole.  The goal  is o eep  the entral s t sy t k c bank's  ross nd  net eserve  ositions om  going  to  zero s  they un  down these orward g a r p fr a r f obligations. hink hat s he  simple  answer  to  your  question.

MR. MELZER. Alan,  I ust  ant  to  make an  observation   another  ssue or eter.  e j w on i f P W are  a  fairly bstantial  lder  f nflation-indexed  asury ecurities    our  portfolio,  ercent  f su ho o i Tre s in 5 p o the  outstandings   something  like  hat.  ooking  down the oad,  s  those ecurities  come more or t L r a s be useful s  guides o  monetary  policy  n erms f iving s  insight to nflation  pectations d  real a t i t o g u in i ex an rates,  wonder  whether e ought  to  be  investing   that  arket.

that  e are  a  significant ugh player  o  affect  ow those arkets rade,  t  ay undermine  the w eno t h m t i m usefulness  f he  information.    don't  xpect n  answer ight  ow. I  assume  that  ur urchases o t I e a r n o p have  been  on  the  same  basis  s  they re  for ny  other reasury ecurities,   e may want  to  think a a a T s butw about ontinuing  o  acquire  hose bligations    we go  forward,  erhaps s  they ecome more c t t o as p a b useful  o  us  from  an  information int f iew. t po o v

MR.  FISHER.  That's    very  good  thought.  et  me make a  few observations r he a L fo t benefit  f he  whole  Committee. First,   are  treated   an  "add-on"  in  the  Treasury's suance  t o t we as is a the  long  end, o  our urchases  o  not educe hat  the reasury ssues  o  the ublic.  hether  to s p d r w T i t p W buy such  obligations    all  as a  bit  f   dilemma  for s.  If  he reasury aunches    new program at w o a u t T l a and  we do  not uy  any  of  the ecurities, re  s   risk  f   negative  nference  or he ew b s the i a o a i f t n instrument  hat  he reasury s arketing. here  is lso   risk  hat  f  he ew type f  security t t T i m T a a t i t n o becomes a  major  vehicle  or reasury unding nd  we have  not  bought ny  such  securities,  will f T f a a we need  to uy them  in rder o  keep  the  SOMA b o t portfolio vested  n  the  deepest  rea f he in i a o t Treasury's suance.  n the  other ide f he  dilemma,  obviously, e otion f  central nk is O s o t th n o ba purchases f  inflation-indexed  urities  s  a  certain  dd  ring o t. o sec ha o t i

MR. MELZER. That  occurred o  me. t

MR.  FISHER.  But  as  I  noted,  e are ot  a  net ubtractor  arket upply ecause  the w n s ofm s b Treasury reats  s  as  an  "add-on."  An additional ason or olding ome of hese ecurities  s  to t u re f h s t s wa have  them  available r ur  securities  nding rogram.  You inspired  to  comment on  that fo o le p me program  at n  earlier eting,  nd  I  have  told he ommittee  that  e are  trying  o ome up  with a me a t C w t c a new program.  I  hope  to  come back  to he ommittee  during he all  ith  some new ideas or hat. t C t f w f t It ight  well  help he nflation-indexed  ket  if  e were  in n  improved  position   lend m t i mar w a to securities    that  arket. to m

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Is  there oing  to e  a  forward arket  in hose ecurities? g b m t s MR. FISHER.  Not  that 'm ware  of. I a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without  objection.  hank you very uch. Mike Prell, T m you are  on.

MR. PRELL.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. n  the pening  sentence  f I o o the  Greenbook,  we characterized  e conomy as  continuing  to  hum along th e " in  recent  onths."  As of ast  hursday, e were  able o  report  hat  iring m l T w t t h remained  strong nd  that  igh-spirited sumers  were once  again pending a h con s heavily  t uto ealers  nd  other etail tlets. w  we can  report  hat a a d a r ou No t homebuilders re  busy, oo.  According  to  this  orning's  elease, ich  is a t m r wh summarized  in  the able  ou  received, tal  ousing tarts re  unchanged  in t y to h s we July,  s  we expected. ingle-family arts se   percent, st    hair  bove a S st ro 3 ju a a our  guess, ut ermits or uch  units  ere  off    percent.  n the hole, hese b p f s w 2 O w t data,  long  with he pbeat eport  rom  the omebuilders urvey or arly a t u r f h s f e August, ould  seem to  support  ur  view  that  he ousing ector  s oing w o t h s i d quite  ell t  this  uncture. w a j

Indeed,  he  basic oint  s hat  he ndicators  w in  hand  provide ew t p i t t i no f direct  ints  hat  conomic  expansion ill  e  limited  o he elatively h t e w b t t r moderate ath  that  e think  s head.  We  are redicting at  eal  DP p w i a p th r G growth  will verage ust  -1/4 ercent  ver  the ext ew  quarters--well a j 2 p o n f below  the -1/4 ercent  ate f he ast ear.  And as  you  know, a  slowing f 3 p r o t p y o at east  his  egree ikely  ecessary,  iven ur  assessment f he rend  f l t d l isn g o o t t o potential,    e are  to void  a  further tensification  ressures  n  an ifw a in of p i already  aut  abor arket. t l m

Unfortunately,  r  near-term  rowth  forecast nges rucially   a ou g hi c on judgment  about  the utlook or nventories--a y  tricky  lement o  predict. o f i ver e t In  a  nutshell,   find t  ifficult   elieve  hat  he ace  of ccumulation  n we i d tob t t p a i the  second  quarter  as as  high s  the vailable  tatistics  icate. t, fter w a a s ind Bu a discounting  he  data s  much as  we feel omfortable  oing  at his  oint, t a c d t p we are  still  ft  ith   rate  f nventory  rowth  that  s learly sustainable-le w a o i g i c un around  a  6  percent  nnual ate.  e  don't  hink  here ere  major verhangs a r W t t w o of ndesired tocks  t idyear, ut here ill e  if  he ccumulation  oesn't u s a m b t w b t a d slow  soon.  Our  guess  is hat  t  ill,  xerting  n  appreciable mping t i w e a da influence  n GDP  growth  in  the  second  half  f his  ear. o o t y

What could  go  wrong with  this  orecast?  he  possibilities f T are numerous.  One is hat  he ate f ccumulation  ould  have  been  even  lower t t r o a c than  we have  assumed, o  that  he ear-term  rag  on  output ight  therefore s t n d m be  less  han e are  anticipating.  's   intuition  at  his  hould e  viewed t w It my th t s b as  the ore  likely  lternative    our  Greenbook  forecast an hat  nventory m a to h t i investment  as  been  greater an e have  assumed. h th w

But  what  if  e have  the ate  f nventory  nvestment  n  the econd w r o i i i s quarter  ust  ight? he possibility ld  still  ist  hat  usinesses ll ant j r T wou ex t b wi w to  maintain  hat  risk  ace  of ccumulation    little  nger  ecause hey  are t b p a a lo b t highly ptimistic out  sales  rospects.  owever,  I  don't  ense uch  a o ab p H s s degree  of ptimism  now; nor  am I  as  concerned s  I  was  earlier at  inal o a th f demand might  seriously ershoot  ur  forecast,    turn enerating  dditional ov o in g a inventory  equirements. r

In  particular,  have  been  noting  or ome time  the isk  hat  onsumer we f s r t c demand might  yet  surge n  response o he normous run-up n  stock arket i t t e i m wealth. ow  that  he  national come accounts how the ersonal  aving N t in s p s rate eclining  onsiderably  ver he ast ouple  of ears,  he  likelihood d c o t p c y t of such  a  spending urge ould seem  to  have  diminished.  oreover, or hat s w M f w it  s orth  as  we look  ahead, he lip  ide f his  rgument  is hat  e can i w t f s o t a t w perhaps  also e  somewhat more  confident  hat  here ill  ndeed e  some b t t w i b demand-damping effect  f  he  stock arket  drops,  s  we are till  edicting i t m a s pr it will. he wavering  of he arket  recently  ight  suggest e are n  the  right T t m m w o track  n  that  egard,  ut e have  been  wrong  before. i r b w

The central  uestion  n  the conomy q o e that  e face his  orning  is uch the  same as  the uestion  e faced  at he ast  eeting  and  at w t m m q w t l m earlier etings:  s  demand reviving  s  we move into he hird  uarter  r  not?

On the  national  icture,  e reenbook projection   ertainly  asonable.  ike  a  number p th G isc re L of  others  round  the able,  still  ink  hat  he  risk  f rror  n he rojection   oderately ilted a t we th t t o e i t p ism t to the  upside. he  major  reports  hat  e have  received  ince  arly  uly--the bs eport, e T t w s e J jo r th Purchasing anagers'  Survey, he  reports  n  retail les  nd  automobile ales--all gest,  t  least M t o sa a s sug a to  me,  that  he conomy is oised o  put  some additional  ward pressure  n  our  labor  esources. t e p t up o r

The good  news on  lower  inflation    1997 c wi n in is elcome,  but  as  we all  now it  s artly   illusion.  e  low  CPI  inflation    1997 reflects  e w k i p an Th in th moderation f  energy rices  fter    surge n  1996.

If  e want  to  eliminate  he onth-to-month oise n  the ata,  ather  han ocusing w t m n i d r t f on the x-food-and-energy asures  we can  simply  average PI  inflation  er  a  longer  eriod  r e me C ov p o we can  look  at   measure  such  as  the edian  CPI.  The  median  CPI  averaged ver hree onths  has a m o t m remained  around  3 percent  t n  annual ate  ver  the irst ven  months of  1997,  essentially a a r o f se the same pattern  s  in ecent  ears.   guess he uestion  s hether hat  s  good  enough.

MR. MEYER. But  I  am at east  n  old aradigm  with   new NAIRU. l a p a I  recently ve ha become more optimistic out he  near-term  utlook n  response o ata ndicating  ch larger ab t o i t d i mu than  expected nventory  uilding  n  the  second  quarter, ntinued  avorable  nflation  ws,  and  the i b i co f i ne further  ppreciation   the ollar.  hese  developments  suggest  hat  t  s ow less  ikely  hat  he a of d T t i i n l t t economy will ebound  to  well-above-trend  owth  in  the  second alf, d  more  likely  hat  nflation r gr h an t i will emain  well  contained  n  the ear erm.  I  guess hat  akes me,  along ith  Bob Parry,  n  old r i n t t m w a paradigm  newly  found  optimist.

This  more benign utlook eflects  osscurrents    both utput rowth  and  inflation o r cr on o g in the  near erm,  rosscurrents  at  re ery  well aptured  n he reenbook  forecast d  discussion. t c th a v c i t G an The first osscurrent   etween  slowing  inventory  nvestment  nd  rebounding emand.

Developments  so  far his  ear,  owever, uggest rosscurrents  at ight  slow  this  rocess. t y h s c th m p

In  this  ase,  t  s nertia  at t n t wa i go f c i i i th is ur  friend, d  the esult    virtuous  age/price  piral. o an r isa w s

Second,  some of  the ransitory  ctors  hat  ave  been  restraining  flation, ticularly t fa t h in par the  effect  f he ollar  n  import rices, pear o  be  less  ransitory  an reviously  xpected o t d o p ap t t th p e following  he  further  ppreciation  he ollar  ince he  last  eeting. t a oft d s t m

Third,  he  upward  adjustment  f rofits   the IPA revisions ggests  ore of   cushion t o p in N su m a that ight  delay assthroughs  f  any  future  ncreases  ompensation. hile  the  net  effect   still m p o i inc W is likely  o e  higher  nflation  er he orecast rizon,  ny  increase  ill  egin  from  a  slightly  wer t b i ov t f ho a w b lo base, nd  at east  ver  the orecast rizon ay be  even  more modest  than  previously  xpected. a l o f ho m e The net  effect  s he rospect  f  a  more  benign nvironment oing  forward,  hough  one  certainly i t p o e g t not  without ts  hallenges.  ooking  at he reenbook  forecast, 's  rd  not  to  be  delighted th  the i c L t G it ha wi projected  utcome  in  1998 unless  e have  become jaded y  two  years f tronger-than-expected o w b o s growth  and  lower-than-expected  flation. in

While  the  near-term  utlook ooks ore benign,   still ew  the isks  s  asymmetric. o l m I vi r a Consensus  forecasts r he  second  half, r xample,  still  pear o e  in  the -1/2 o  3  percent fo t fo e ap t b 2 t range,  ompared  to he  2-1/4 ercent  ate  rojected  n  the reenbook.  While  the lowdown in c t p r p i G s inventories ould e  a  drag  in he eriod mmediately head,   would interpret  e  inventory sh b t p i a I th building  n  the econd  quarter  s  largely  oluntary, d  therefore  measure  of he  confidence  hat i s a v an a t t businesses  ave  in he conomy going  forward.

But  I  expect ne of he  more  important  tories ill   e  written  bout his  xpansion s o t s t tob a t e i how the  economy will ind ts  ay back  to AIRU,  assuming  we are lready  elow  NAIRU. f i w N a b In  the Blue  Chip  consensus orecast,  e  economy slows  on  its  wn over  1998  to  a  below-trend  ate  nd, f th o r a

as  a  result,  e nemployment  rate  etreats owly oward  NAIRU,  fortunately  fore nflation  ses th u r sl t be i ri to  any  considerable gree.  In  this  ase erhaps e can  sit  ack  and  watch. de c p w b

In  the reenbook on  the ther and, he  economy grows  at  trend,  reserving e G o h t p th prevailing ilization es,  nd  as  a  result,  flation  ses  radually  ver  time. his ersion f he ut rat a in ri g o T v o t story  s  waiting  or s  to rite he  conclusion.  he  change  in  the utlook ince ur  last  eeting i f u w t T o s o m suggests, wever,  that  e may have  more time  to  refine  ur  forecast fore e have  to en  our ho w o be w p conclusion.

When  I  looked  at he  Greenbook  and  listened   a  number of eople eport  bout t to p r a a pickup  in conomic  activity,  e ords  "rebounding"  nd  "somewhat stronger" re used  to e th w a we describe  he ear-term utlook.  et, he reenbook  has  2.6  percent  eal  DP  growth  in  the econd t n o Y t G r G s quarter  nd  2.3  percent  or he hird  uarter.  n the urface, at  ould  lead eople o  think hat a f t t q O s th w p t t there  s ome weakening  or  softening ing  on. But  what  it  ays o  me is hat  he  growth  reported i s go s t t t for he  second  quarter, suming  that  he ommerce  Department umbers  are  correct, s t as t C n wa unsustainable. e mix was unsustainable  d, s  one  exceptionally  art conomist nce  said, Th an a sm e o unsustainable ings  ave  a  habit f nding. hen  we look  at hat  econd  quarter  ith  weakness th h o e W t s w on the  consumer  side,  ooming  capital  pending--which  ould  suggest  apacity  s ncreasing--a b s w c i i dramatic urge  in mports,  nd  inventory  ccumulation  hat  s xtraordinary  r   second  quarter, s i a a t i e fo a

we have  to  conclude hat omething s  fundamentally  rong. If hose uarterly mbers  are  right, t s i w t q nu those onditions nnot e sustained.  he Greenbook  fixes hings  y  having  everything  hift  he c ca b T t b s t other ay. The consumer  comes back, hich I  guess  is hat  we mean by  a  pickup r  rebound  even w w w o though  real DP  is rojected  o  slow.  There  is   dramatic  egative  wing  in nventory  pending, G p t a n s i s and  net xports  lso ake a  negative  ontribution   he orecast r he  third  uarter.    don't  now e a m c int f fo t q I k whether  that  s   correct  orecast  ot.  I  certainly  pe  so  because f  t sn't,   problems ill  e i a f orn ho i i i our w b much,  much greater.  e  need  an  outcome  something ike  he reenbook's hird  uarter  nd  also W l t G t q a its  ourth  uarter  r e will ave  missed  something ere n  a  very  serious  ay. f q o w h h i w

The question  n  my mind,  then,  s  how to  monitor hether  that  s ccurring  r  not.  A i i w i o o part f  it,  etting to he  monetary umbers,  is he  need  to ake sure hat  he ehavior f hose o g in t n t m t t b o t numbers stays ather  ranquil,  cluding  low  growth  in  M2  which  has  been  running t   rate  ust r t in s a a j under  5 percent  nd  some slowing  in he rowth  of ZM a t g M from  almost  percent  n he  second 7 i t quarter  o  something nder  5  percent.  he  recent  ump in he  growth  of he onetary  base  is lso t u T j t t m a worrisome  even  though  it eflects  ly  a  few weeks'  data;  hat  rowth  needs  to low. r on t g s

I  am troubled, ough,  hat  s  we get ut  to  September th t a o 30 t h , we are  not  going o now a t k great eal  more than e do  today  about he erformance f  the conomy.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Mr.  Kohn.

MR. KOHN. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. As background  for he t Committee's  ecision  oday,    will egin y  taking    few minutes o  discuss d t I b b a t real nterest  tes, ncentrating    the eal ederal  unds  rate,  iven  its i ra co on r f f g occasional  se  as  an  index  for he tance f onetary olicy.  n  the ourse f u t s o m p I c o my discussion, ill e  referring   the  set f harts  hat  as  been  distributed; I  w b to o c t h these pdate  selected  harts  rom  the inancial  ndicators  ckage. u c f F I pa 2

As you can  see  from  the anels n  the ight  ide f he irst art,  he p o r s o t f ch t real ederal  unds  rate  as  risen  onsiderably is  ear hen lagged  CPI f f h c th y w inflation   sed  to roxy  for xpected uture  nflation.  e increase  s isu p e f i Th i a product f  the ommittee's  ecision  o  raise  he ominal  funds ate n  March o C d t t n r i as  well s  a  decline  n nflation  pectations,    estimated  sing hese roxies. a i i ex as u t p One might  question  hether nflation  pectations tually ve  decreased  s w i ex ac ha a much as  has  measured  inflation--especially   PI inflation, ch  has  been total C whi driven  mportantly  y  temporary wings  in  energy rices  ver  the  last  wo i b s p o t years.  But  qualitatively  ilar vements are  also vident  hen real  ates sim mo e w r are  constructed   subtracting  e  results  urveys f nflation  pectations. by th ofs o i ex

Moreover,  as  you  can  see  by  comparing  the ottom o  the op  rows  in b t t the  lower anel,  he urrent  evel f he  real  ederal  unds ate  s airly gh p t c l o t f f r i f hi relative   history--in  e eighborhood f  a  percentage  oint  bove  its to th n o p a average  over he ntire  ample, rom 1965 to  the resent.  his  sample  period t e s f p T was chosen  because  it as  about he  same inflation  te  t he eginning nd h t ra a t b a the  end.  This hould ndicate at  ver his  nterval e conomy experienced s i th o t i th e about  the ame amount  of xcess emand pushing p inflation  d  excess s e d u an supply ushing t  own so  that,  n average,  utput as at ts  otential. p i d o o w i p Consequently,  ther hings  qual,  he  average eal  ederal  unds ate  rom o t e t r f f r f 1965 to  1997 might  be  a  reasonable  pproximation  f he atural  r a o t n o equilibrium deral  unds  rate onsistent  th olding he  economy at fe f c wi h t potential d  keeping  inflation  eady. an st

But, f  course,  ther  hings  ave  not een  equal.  One set f o o t h b o developments hat  robably as  been  tending  o  shift  p  the quilibrium al t p h t u e re rate ver  the ast  0  years as  been  deregulation d  innovation  n  financial o l 3 h an i markets.  The dismantling  f egulatory terest  te eilings d  the pread f o r in ra c an s o loan  securitizations    other  eans of iversifying  urces f unds  have and m d so o f removed or  reduced mportant  ources f onprice  ationing   credit  arkets. i s o n r in m Greater eliance  n  the rice f redit   allocate arce aving mplies  hat r o p o c to sc s i t higher eal nterest  tes  re eeded. r i ra a n

Aside  from  such  structural  anges,  he  equilibrium al  unds ate  ill ch t re f r w depend  on  cyclical   one-time nfluences  the conomy and  financial or i on e markets.  Certainly,  e equired  evel  f nterest  tes  as lifted    the arlyth r l o i ra w in e

and  mid-1980s  by  an  expansive  iscal licy,  nd  reduced n  the arly  990s f po a i e 1 by  the  so-called edit  runch. cr c

What can  we infer  bout quilibrium tes  n ecent  ears?  Note  that, a e ra i r y although  he  actual  eal  ate  as  risen  o  a  fairly gh evel  f ate,   s ow t r r h t hi l o l it i n only  a  little  ove  the ange  f he ast  ew  years. oreover, f  he taff d ab r o t l f M i t s an Committee members are  right  bout  the light  ickup n  the PI  next ear, a s p i C y some of he ery  recent  ncreases   the alculated al  ate ill e  reversed. t v i in c re r w b Real  funds ates  ear hese levated  evels  ver he ast  hree ears ave  not r n t e l o t l t y h connoted  a  restrictive etary  policy. nstead, er  this  eriod,  obust mon I ov p r growth  has  propelled  he conomy to  a  level  hat  xceeds any estimates t e t e m of its ong-run  otential.   important  eason or his,   Committee  members l p An r f t as have  pointed ut  in ast eetings,  s he  strong  emand for apital ods. o p m i t d c go The  profitability  his  nvestment  eans that  igher-than-normal  al  ates of t i m h re r may be  needed  to  avoid nflationary ssures  resources.  nd this i pre on A profitability    been  reflected    other  inancial rkets,  uch  as  for quity, has in f ma s e where  high rices  ave  reduced he  cost f apital d  boosted et orth, p h t o c an n w further  amping any  restraint  om  short-term al ates. d fr re r

Moreover,  a  somewhat different  cture  f inancial nditions pi o f co is portrayed  y  longer-term  eal  nterest  tes.  uch  of he un-up  in he eal b r i ra M t r t r federal  unds  rate  ver his  pring  nd  summer apparently  as  not een f o t s a h b transmitted t  along  the ield urve. he  rise  n he eal unds ate esulted ou y c T i t r f r r importantly  rom  the  drop  in easured  inflation  pectations ainst    fixed f m ex ag a nominal  funds  rate. ut  nominal  longer-term  ates  ave  been  free o ecrease B r h t d with  inflation  pectations--and  ey ave  done  so, eaving  eal  ields  n  the ex th h l r y o Treasury's dexed  debt  fluctuating  irly rrowly. he top  panel f he  next in fa na T o t chart hows other  easures  of eal ong-term  reasury  ields. espite   small s m r l T y D a upward  trend ince arly 996,  these ates  emain  appreciably low  their s e 1 r r be peaks  of 994-95.  The uptrend s ven  more muted  in rivate  ates, e ower 1 i e p r th l panel,  hich  have  been  held own by  low  and  narrowing isk  remiums. The w d r p behavior f  these remiums is ndicative   he  generally  eady  availability o p i oft r of financing  or rivate  orrowers,  hich  itself  uld  boost equired  eal  ates f p b w wo r r r on  federal  unds r  Treasury  ecurities. f o s

The  effects  f he lattening  eld  urve  and  declining  isk  remiums on o t f yi c r p the  real rivate nd yield  an  be  seen  in hart  3,  which  plots  his  ield p bo c c 1 t y against  he ubsequent ear's  hange  in nflation.  is echnique,  ike  he se t s y c i Th t l t u of istorical  erages,  s imited  y  the mplicit sumption hat  istory h av i l b i as t h provides eliable idance o  future  evelopments--that   equilibrium te r gu t d the ra has  not  shifted gnificantly r he ast 5 years.  And,  as  you can  see, he si ove t p 1 t fit  s ot  tight. netheless, al  ong-term  ates  n  1996  and  1997--plotted i n No re l r i in the  diamonds  marked 97  and  98  for he reenbook  projection  he hange  in t G oft c inflation  r hose ears--are t  elevated  y  this  tandard;  hey  are ertainly fo t y no b s t c not  in he estrictive  ritory  plied  y  recent  eadings  f he eal  unds ate. t r ter im b r o t r f r

While  not  evident  n omestic redit  nd  equity  arkets,  levated  eal i d c a m e r short-term tes  ay still ve  some restraining  fect.  or  example, hey ra m ha ef F t may be  one  factor  ehind  the trength  f he ollar, ough  questions  bout b s o t d th a foreign  conomies  and  policies kely  ave  been  important.  hatever  the e li h W reason,  he ppreciation  he  dollar  hould elp  to  hold  down U.S. t a oft s h production  nd  prices.  oreover,  further creases  n  real hort  ates--through a M in i s r policy  ightening tion  r  declining  nflation  pectations thout t ac o i ex wi compensating  policy  asing--would  ut  upward  pressure  n  real ntermediatee p o i and  long-term  ates. r

In  sum,  short-term al  ates  re igh,  nd  they ave  risen  ecently. re r a h a h r The current  eal  evel f he  funds ate  ay provide ome assurance  hat r l o t r m s t policy  s ot  highly timulative.  t, n  the bsence  of olicy  ction, e  real i n s Bu i a p a th funds  rate  s ikely   begin o  edge  lower  as  some of he pecial  actors i l to t t s f holding own inflation  ar  off  nd  higher nflation  tes  egin o  affect d we a i ra b t expectations. reover,  even  very  high  real  ederal  unds ates  ay not Mo f f r m necessarily  dicate  estraint    even  neutrality    monetary  policy  hen other in r or in w important  lements n  overall  inancial  nditions e  considered, pecially e i f co ar es taking ccount  of  the trong  emand for apital. al  short-  nd  long-term a s d c Re a rates  lose o  current  evels  ave  apparently  llowed utput  o  overshoot c t l h a o t sustainable  vels,  nd  in  the taff recast is  ituation   ot orrected le a s o h s isn c without   change  in  policy. a

Still,  nsiderable certainty rsists  out he evel  nd  growth  of co un pe ab t l a potential  tput nd  the mplications r nflation   perating  or   time ith ou a i fo i ofo f a w the  current  egree f autness  abor arkets,  hich  may be  seen  as d o t inl m w supporting    continuation  he ait-and-see sture f lternative The a oft w po o a B. drop  in nflation  pectations ovides  n  additional unterweight  o he i ex pr a co t t effects  f esource  ressures  n  prices, lowing  he ommittee  to  await o r p o al t C firmer  igns hat  nflation   ikely  ntensify  thout isking    substantial s t i isl toi wi r a acceleration    prices.  nd with  inventory  nvestment  ikely  o  slow, he dds in A i l t t o on a  near-term  trengthening  roduction  hat  ould  increase  esource s ofp t w r utilization es  ave  diminished.  ecently ore volatile nditions rat h R m co in financial rkets  may also ounsel aution.  his  development  may be ma c c T associated  ith  some second  thoughts  bout ust  ow rosy he  outlook or w a j h t f prices,  rofits,  d  interest  tes  ay be.  If  arkets ecome more cautious, p an ra m m b equity rices  nd  credit  preads ould  become a  little  ss timulative. p a s w le s

If he  Committee  were  to hoose  to  keep  the tance f olicy t c s o p unchanged,  it  ould need  again o onsider  hether o etain  he  asymmetry w t c w t r t in  its  irective.  compared to he  situation    early  uly hen the d As t in J w Committee  last  oted o ave  an  asymmetric irective,  e avorable  ehavior v t h d th f b of  prices  nd  price xpectations,  ong ith  a  slightly  ss  xpansive taff a e al w le e s forecast  or rowth  going  forward,  ay be  read  as  reducing he rgency o f g m t u t take ction  hould ny  signs f nflation  essures  merge over he  near erm. a s a o i pr e t t On the  other  and, he asic ituation  s  not hanged  since arly  uly:  he h t b s ha c e J T

This  brings e to  the anguage f he irective.   you  suggested,  r. m l o t d As M Chairman,  I  polled  he embers for heir  iews  on  the ording  of he wo t m t v w t t sentences,  nd  as  I  suspected, ere  ere  almost s  many suggestions a th w a as members.

MR. MEYER. Don,  before ach  FOMC e meeting  we are  provided   memo  on  what a various  ules  re  indicating,   Taylor ule articularly.  recollection hat he quilibrium r a the r p My ist t e real  nterest  te onstructed  hat  ase s or  a  2  percent  eal unds  rate,  sing he hained DP i ra c int c i f r f u t c G deflator.

MR. KOHN. Right.

MR. MEYER. Do you  want  to  talk  riefly out he able  t he ottom  of hart 0 in b ab t t a t b c 1 your  handout  and  its  mplications? ile  I m a  strong  eliever   some of he isdom embedded i Wh a b in t w in  the aylor ule,    have  been  concerned or   long  time hat  e need  to  be  more careful  bout ow T r I f a t w a h we set  its  evel  y  coming  up  with   more  reasonable  stimate  f he quilibrium al unds ate. l b a e o t e re f r The 2 percent  omes from  Taylor's uristic unding. o you  think  his  able  rovides c he ro D t t p a somewhat more thoughtful  stimate? e

MR. KOHN. I  think  hat  f  e took t iterally,    I  would  have  to ook t  that, t i w i l and l a it actually uld be  a  little  gher f  e used  the  GDP  deflator er ime, hich  is hat  Taylor's le wo hi i w ov t w w ru is ased  on.  These  days  the DP  deflator nds o un  a  little  low  the PI,  but ver  time  I  think t b G te t r be C o i runs  a  little  ove.  So,  f  e use  the eflator,  e ap  between  the   percent  nd  what  we might ab i w d th g 2 a think f  as  history  ver he  1965 to  1997 period ould  be  a  little  rger.  o,  we need  to hink  bout o o t w la S t a that  ule n  the ontext  f hat  price  ndex e are  using,  hat  changes ave  been  made to  the rice r i c o w i w w h p index  over he  years hat ight  have  distorted    oing ack  in  history, d  whether  it  ay be  less t t m it g b an m distorted  w. I  think ost  researchers,    we have  been  told  ver  the ast ew  years,  ave  not no m as o p f h found  a  big hange  in he  amount  of ias n  the ndexes,  ut  we need  to e  careful  bout hat. c t b i i b b a t I think  ll hese actors e  important.    know that  artly  t our  behest,  overnor  Meyer,  people n a t f ar I p a y G o the  staff e rying  o ake ccount f  these arious  actors  nd  make a  more sophisticated, ar t t t a o v f a technically  stifiable  imate  f he eal  unds ate ven  for he ery  simple aylor ule. he real ju est o t r f r e t v T r T funds  rate  n hat  ule s ot  allowed o  move around.  The other  ajor  issue, en  if  e know how i t r i n t m ev w to  measure  the eal  unds  rate,  hether  it  oves around  from  time o  time.  So,  we should ake r f isw m t t account f  all hese ther spects. o t o a

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Don,  I ave  a  question  or ou  that  omes from h f y c page 1  of he luebook.  In  the ifth ne  own you state  hat  longer-term  ominal  yields  ere t B f li d t " n w down  15 to  25  basis  oints, t ields  n  indexed  debt ere  about nchanged, uggesting  hat p bu y o w u s t a slight  eduction"  tc. s art f he  reason ou  use  the erm  "suggesting"  hat  ou  believe  hat  hese r e I p o t y t t y t t bonds  are ew enough  and  still  t iquid  nough that  hey ill ot  tell  s  as  much as  they ight n no l e t w n u m "X" years  from  now when they re  not  so  new and  have  become more  liquid? a

MR.  KOHN. That  is ne  of he actors,  esident  cDonough,  in  the ense  that o t f Pr M s relatively  all rades  an  push  these ates  round  because  these  arkets re  not iquid, d  I hink sm t c r a m a l an t

we need  to  be  careful  bout nterpreting ll ps  and  downs in  the ields.  n the  other  and, a i sma u y O h I don't  hink  he ack f  liquidity    the  market itiates  eir  sefulness tirely. ere  are  a  few t t l o in v th u en Th folks  ut  there,  t east  s  one  talks  o  people n  the treet, o are eeping heir e  on  these o a l a t o S wh k t ey things.  hey are  doing  a  little  ading.  nd if  here  ere  a  sense,  or xample, hat  he  economy T tr A t w f e t t was terribly  rong  nd  the ed  really  eeded  to aise  eal  nterest  tes    lot  o  keep  inflation  wn st a F n r r i ra a t do and  was going o  do  so,   think  hese ields  ould go  up. Now, we would have  to  be  careful  bout t I t y w a whether  we should ount  every asis  oint  nd  look  at hat pread or very  basis  oint.    think  t  s c b p a t s f e p I i i useful  o  look t hat  ield  nd  at he pread n  a  general  ind  of ay,  but e have  to e  careful  ot t a t y a t s i k w w b n to  slice  t  oo hinly. i t t

Another  factor  ere s elative pply. he  Treasury as  cut  back  on  its  ote uctions, h i r su T h n a and  in  particular    as  eliminated  ten-year te  auction  r  two  and  is oncentrating  re  of ts it h a no o c mo i issuance  n  the ndexed  area. o  there  ay be, articularly h  a  thin arket,  ome relative pply i i S m p wit m s su effects at rdinarily   would  think ould  wash out  very  quickly  n  a  nominal  bond  market ut th o we w i b that  ay have  some effect  n  the ndexed arket.  Nonetheless,    think  he act hat  he pread as m i i m I t f t t s h come down by  almost 0  basis  oints  ver our onths  suggests  omething. 5 p o f m s

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. I  think  ou  have  it  ust  ight.    elieve  t  ells y j r Ib i t us something,  ut e have  to  be  very areful  ot o  get verly aught p  with  it  uite  et. b w c n t o c u q y

MR.  KOHN. The other  oint    would  make about  the entence  hat  ou  pointed  o  is hat p I s t y t t we characterize    s  inflation  mpensation. here  is nother  art o nflation  mpensation. t s it a co T a p t i co I i not  only  expectations;    s he nflation  sk  remium. One had  a  sense,  articularly r he pring iti t i ri p p ove t s through he  end  of uly,  hat  ot  only ere  people erhaps   little  re optimistic    inflation, t J t n w p a mo on but they  were  a  little  ss  ncertain out heir  ptimism.  So,  one  reason hat  ominal  yields  ight le u ab t o t n m have  dropped  relative    the eal  ield  s ot ntirely  decline  n nflation  pectations t to r y i n e a i i ex bu a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The term  "inflation  mpensation" s eally    word of rt co i r a a because  what  is eing rojected re  is ot rue  nflation  pectations,  cluding  he isk  remium, b p he n t i ex in t r p but  a  forecast  he  CPI  as  published.  nd that  ay or  may not e  exactly  qual o nflation oft A m b e t i expectations. t  shouldn't e ord "expectations"    in  this  entence--"a ight duction  n Bu th w be s sl re i "expected"  ong-term  nflation  mpensation"? l i co

MR.  KOHN. It s   reduction  n he  actual  ompensation hat  nvestors e  demanding i a i t c t i ar for uying  a  nominal  bond.  Its ize ould  depend  on  their  xpectations r nflation  d  on  the b s w e fo i an standard  rror  r  standard  eviation-e o d

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. It s   kind  of conomist's by-12,    think. i a e 9I

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Further  uestions  or  on?  If  ot, et  e start.  will  e  a q f D n l m I b good deal riefer an  I  have  been  of ate.  o be  sure,  s  Governor  Kelley ndicated,  t  all  hat b th l T a i no t much has  changed  in  the eriod ince he  last  eeting,  ut here re  a  few fundamentals  hat    think p s t m b t a t I require    bit  f valuation. a o e

The most  recent  eriod s nteresting  cause t  einforces  e  notion hat  e still  y be p i i be i r th t w ma experiencing  isinflation.  at  is,  t  s ery  clear  n ooking t he rice  ndexes--whether   are d Th i i v i l a t p i we using he  CPI, he  PPI, r he  various IPA  data n prices--that  nflation  te ver hese ast  ix t t o t N o thei ra o t l s months  has  been  coming  in  lower han n  1996 or  at he east  as  been  unchanged.

But  the umbers  do  seriously ggest hat  he nventory i l p n su t t i investment  evel  s xcessive.  o get  a  sense f hether here  s omething llusory    the l i e T o w t i s i in Greenbook  forecast,  ave  converted  he  inventory  nvestment  umbers  to actory  alue,  s  distinct I  h t i n f v a from  chain-weighted flated  ook  value. f  he hysical  uantity  f oods  does  not hange  but e b I t p q o g c merely  moves from  the  factory  evel  o he  retail  vel, e onstant  ollar  alue f  the nventories l t t le th c d v o i rises.  he reason s hat  s  goods  move from  one  sector  f he istribution nnel o  the  next, T i t a o t d cha t value s  added  and  income  is reated.  or ational  ncome  accounting  urposes,  t  s ndeed he i c F n i p i i i t book  value  where  held,  roperly  eflated,  at  s elevant  o he ncome  and  product  ccount p d th i r t t i a calculations.  t  to  measure  whether nventories e xcessive  r ot, e don't  are here  the Bu i ar e o n w c w units  re  held n he istribution eam. hether  automobiles  re  in  inventories   he ealer  evel, a i t d str W a att d l at he  factory  evel,  r  somewhere in he  pipeline  f o significance    the evel  f ssemblies  ut t l o t iso n to l o a b it  s o i t GDP.

In  any  event,  tripping t  the arkups  in he istribution cess,  he actory  alue ata s ou m t d pro t f v d for nventory  nvestment  or he irst lf  f  1997 are  very ignificantly ve  the eak  levels  f i i f t f ha o s abo p o 1994  and  early  995,  whereas  that  s ot  true  or he eflated  IPA total ok  value ata.   don't 1 i n f t d N bo d I know whether  you can  see  this  hart  rom  where  you  are itting,  t he lack ars re hat  the c f s bu t b b a w official  PA data  show,  and  they re  at  about he  same level  s  they ere  in  1994. However,  if NI a t a w you  look  only  at actory  alue,  t  s p  close o  the IPA  data n he irst lf  f  1997,  but t as f v i i u t N i t f ha o i w much lower  in  1994  because   substantial  rt f hose arlier ta eflected rkups  and  not a pa o t e da r ma increased  umbers  of nits. n u

Secondly, athy  Minehan raised  he ssue  s  to  whether,  n  fact,  he nventories re C t i a i t i we produced  by  domestic irms r  were  imported. ith  the aveat hat  he  data hemselves  re  very f o W c t t t a dubious,  he  staff re  has  tried  o ssociate ports ith arious  ypes f nventories    order  o t he t a im w v t o i in t estimate  eparate  omestic nd  foreign-originated  entories. erall,  he  levels  ave  tended o s d a inv Ov t h t run  about ne-fourth  mported,  hree-fourths  mestically oduced. hrough  April nd  May, the o i t do pr T a proportion  f nventory  nvestment  hat  as imported as about ne-fifth--or  s  han  normal.  In o i i t w w o les t that  ense,  e are ot  getting  ny  evidence,  t  least  n hese ata,  uggesting  hat  ll  he nventory s w n a a i t d s t a t i buildup  s  coming  from  imports,  hich,  f  t  ere  the ase, ould  mean that  he mpact f heir i w i i w c w t i o t adjustment  ould  be  on  foreign  roducers  nd  not  on  domestic roduction. e  NIPA  inventory w p a p Th investment  ata ppear o  derive  isproportionately  m  domestic roduction.  ence,  the mpact d a t d fro p H i of  the lowdown in  inventory  rowth  on  the DP  shown in  the reenbook  is redible. s g G G c

If e find nstead  hat  inal  emand is ignificantly her  nd  that  e get urther  trong w i t f d s hig a w f s inventory  ccumulation  rom  either    wealth ffect  r  factors  hat  re  related  nventory a f a e o t a toi investment,  will ot  get  a  slowdown in he  growth  of DP.  In  that  ase,  e will ace ome we n t G c w f s serious  olicy  uestions.  y judgment  is,  s  we have  discussed  efore,  hat  e will  ave  no  choice p q M a b t w h

Let  me add  something  parenthetically  t  as hinted  t ut  not ut n  the able.   very tha w a b p o t A big  part f he  consumer  price  ndex  is elated   property  alues. ou will ecall  hat bout  19 o t i r to v Y r t a percent  f he PI is mputed  owners'  equivalent nt. ents  are ied  o  property  alues. ent  as  a o t C i re R t t v R ratio  o he arket  value f ingle-family  mes has  been  falling r uite    long eriod f ime. t t m o s ho fo q a p o t And the  little  p  that  e saw in he ast  PI  may be  an  indication at  his  atio  s tabilizing po w t l C th t r i s or moving  back  to   somewhat  higher  ath,  hich  suggests  hat  he ervices  PI  may look  a  little a p w t t s C stronger  n  the ear uture  han  we have  seen  of ate.  e  are oing  to ave  to  make a  judgment  as i n f t l W g h to  whether e should ook  at  property-value-related es  omewhat differently  om  prices  hat w l pric s fr t are  related  n ffect   income  flows.   have  raised  his  ssue  efore,  ut e never eally  ave i e to I t i b b w r h confronted  t ecause  the ssue  as  never ome up  with  respect  o   question  f onetary  policy. i b i h c t a o m I would  not e  surprised  f  hat  we encounter  s   CPI  that  ooks   lot tronger t  one  where  the ise b i w i a l a s bu r in  inflation  ll  e  very arrowly oncentrated   these roperty-value-priced  as. ommodity wi b n c in p are C prices  ould e  going  down,  other  rices  ould e  going  down,  and  these rices  ould e  going  up. c b p c b p c b What should e be  looking t?

In  summary,  my general iew  has  not  basically anged.
