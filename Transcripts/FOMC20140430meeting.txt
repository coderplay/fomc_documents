YELLEN.  Good morning, everybody.  Unfortunately, this is the last FOMC think you know that tonight we will farewell reception and dinner for our colleagues, as well as for former governor to take this opportunity to thank them here as well. CHAIR meeting for both President Pianalto and Governor Stein.  I have a joint Sarah Bloom Raskin.  But I would like meetings in 1993 as a first vice president of the Federal started attending as president of the Bank in the relative meetings, which is more than currently serving president.  Sandy has always been a voice of reason, and her Sandy began attending FOMC Reserve Bank of Cleveland and then calm of 2003.

YELLEN.  Okay.  And now let's turn to our first topic, which is monetary policy this discussion will take place as a joint meeting of the FOMC need a motion to close the CHAIR normalization.  Let me say that and the Board.  And with respect to our Board meeting, I will meeting.

MR. TARULLO.  So moved.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection. CHAIR

to start off our session this morning with a few remarks on the objectives and thanks to the staff for all their hard work on these complicated issues and for the memos that they prepared for this meeting. I would like timetable for our work on monetary policy normalization.  Before doing so, though, I want to give special excellent set of tools to adjust the discussion is about materials make clear, however, there is quite into account, involving market functioning, the I don't want to get issues at this point.  I just want to make a few overarching comments our discussion. Let me begin by saying I am completely convinced that we have the stance of policy as needed to meet our macroeconomic objectives.  So this how to deploy our mix of tools to attain these objectives most effectively in a way that balances other considerations appropriately.  As the briefing a mix of subtle and intertwined issues to take scope of our activities in the nonbank sector, communications, financial stability, and possible implications of our current choices for our longer-run operating procedure. into the substance of these that may serve to frame

broadly as we expect, we will likely begin to raise interest rates I believe it is important that we communicate our normalization plans to the well before that time.  I would see the press conference after the September meeting as If the recovery proceeds sometime next year. public potentially providing a good opportunity to lay out for the public some of our thinking on these

There issues here, which we need to work through collectively, before we can be confident confidence to the public. concentrated effort will surely be required to make the necessary progress by matters.  If you agree with this timetable, we will down our approach over are difficult that we are ready to manage the normalization process and convey that So I think a September.

Our deliberations will build on our earlier discussions of normalization and draw on the results testing of our tools.  One lesson from our earlier efforts at spelling out our exit strategy, which is a topic we discussed at sensible ex may end up seeming much less attractive ways.  I think we need to accept conditions and considerations we will face when the time comes to begin raising rates.  And we cannot know with precision how well any particular strategy will work.  So, while I don't want to prejudge in which we can deploy our mix of tools relatively flexibly to deal with contingencies that may arise.

But it is equally important that we agree on a framework that we can explain simply and clearly, so as to convincingly convey our confidence that we can adjust the stance of policy as appropriate the extent possible, about the mechanics of our approach in order to ease market participants, particularly in those markets in which we think our success will depend in part

My hope is that over the course of today's discussion we and reservations, and, more pragmatically, perhaps, we can rule out at stage, your answers to some of the questions may be that is a perfectly fine answer. I want to end by encouraging everyone to be open to the and to keep in mind our overarching goals.  Despite reach firm conclusions can begin to locate, and then refine, our sense of common ground-that we can share frankly our individual perspectives least some alternatives in order to narrow the field of our future decisionmaking.  We have asked you to weigh in on a number of different questions to provide some preliminary feel for where common ground may lie.  But at this you just don't know and are open to different possibilities, and that make comments and ask questions that will clarify for all of us some of difficult issues involved in these choices and help us explore more fully how the available in practice.  As you all know, 'two-handed' interventions are always meetings, but I would say especially so today.  I would like to encourage another as we explore the main to have a go-round to hear at least your preliminary views We have a lot of time for today's discussion, so I hope you will use the Q&amp;A period after the staff presentations to the tools are likely to work welcome at FOMC active back-and-forth discussions with the staff and with one issues.

I will be referring to 'Material for Briefing on the we will review some key points from the memos on normalization that you received over the memo that outlined near-term approaches for conducting policy with a large balance sheet.  As noted in the top-left panel, the Committee has a number of tools to use to

IOER rate over time.  The Committee has at its disposal several tools that combinations to improve control over the level of short-term agreements (which I'll refer to as ON RRPs), raise rates.  Increasing interest on excess reserves will likely, by itself, raise shortterm rates, but these rates could potentially not increase one-for-one and could vary relative to could be used in various rates, including overnight repurchase term RRPs, and term deposits.

memo considers five options for implementing single option; adapt its policy approach over time, observing the making adjustments along the way. As noted to the right, the normalization.  Of course, the Committee is not constrained to choose a it could choose a mix of options or effects of its policies and the memo are summarized in the three options would combine IOER with a full-allotment ON facility and would not use term draining tools.  The ON RRP facility would under overnight rates, as investors with access to the facility rate.  I should at the outset that the Committee might want to impose limits on the allotment of ON RRP facility in order to support financial stability; such limits could be used in The key features of the five options presented in middle panel.  The first RRP likely help to set a floor rate would not have an incentive to lend to any counterparty below this note its any of the options.

the ON RRP rate is set equal to the IOER rate, and these rates would two options are similar to option 1, ON RRP rate set below the IOER rate.  In option 2, the spread would be an administered rate or possibly an alternative rate, such as the ON GC repo rate.  In option 3, the spread between and the IOER rate would be larger, and the ON RRP rate would be move the federal funds rate to the desired target rate or range set by the between the ON RRP rate and the IOER rate is larger in to maintain incentives for the federal funds trading In option 1, be the center of policy communication.

In options 4 and 5, the quantity of reserves needed to be drained would be uncertain and would depend on the level of the federal funds rate the desired spread between the IOER rate and federal funds rate.  It is possible that policymakers would judge the relationship between the funds rate to be sufficiently stable

Alternatively, if a very large amount of reserves Reserve might have to build a panel lists six key policy issues that you may want to consider as you may want to evaluate how the the market rates.  Option 1, with the ON RRP rate set to the IOER rate, most control, because other short-term money market rates or slightly above these two administered rates.  The other which the ON RRP rate is set below the IOER rate, may see market rates 5, could help to improve control as well, though the extent of the The bottom evaluate these alternative approaches.  First, you options differ in terms of their control of short-term interest rates.  By increasing IOER rate, all options can likely move market rates higher, but the degree of control is uncertain.  The ON RRP exercise suggests that such a facility is likely to help set a firmer floor on would likely result in the would probably trade at options, in trade between the two administered rates.  Of course, use of the term tools, as under options 4 or required operations is uncertain.

to have relatively overnight administered and market to take account of the effects of the level of reserve balances and the efficiency of financial Second, you may want to evaluate how efficient the options are in conducting monetary policy.  It is difficult to determine each option's full range of effects on financial markets and financial intermediation.  That said, if you prefer interest rates on similar assets set at similar levels, then you may prefer a narrow spread between the IOER rate and other rates, as in options 1 or 2.  You may also want different options on the intermediation.

an active federal funds that include no a fairly narrow spread between the IOER and ON RRP rates, such as market would likely decline to a level connected to other adjustments that the Committee could make. Third, you will need to decide whether you want to have market, so you can continue to target the federal funds rate.  In options spread or options 1 and 2, trading in the federal funds that may lead the federal funds effective rate to become less tightly money market rates.

As outlined in the upper-left panel of exhibit 2, my portion federal funds market and briefly note how the effective constructed each day and how it is used in financial markets.  Then I will discussion of some of the contractual issues that federal funds rate unexpectedly changed or ceased and highlight some of that mitigating the impact of these risks, including the possible consideration of alternative target rates.

regarding the state of the federal funds market, prior to 2008, trading market was relatively robust, with about $200 billion in across the entire fed funds market, as seen in the upper-right panel. made up of lending by GSEs to banks.  In the has shrunk to about $60 billion, 30 percent of its substantial majority of the remaining activity representing one Home Loan Banks lending to foreign banking organizations. First, activity in the fed funds trades each day Roughly 60 percent of this activity was believed to comprise interbank borrowing and lending, with most of the remainder past few years, average daily volume pre-crisis level, with a type of lending:  Federal market is conducted in two ways:  directly between Trading in the fed funds holders of reserve balances or via a broker.  The effective federal funds rate is constructed by the Desk each morning based on data received from four of the largest

brokers for all fed funds trades conducted through those brokers on the prior day. The effective rate is then published by the Desk.

in monetary policy, the effective federal funds rate appears products as a reference rate.  Although it is much less widely funds rate is referenced in a broad set of contracts and agreements, most notably fed funds futures and overnight funds rate were to unexpectedly cease or if change in its definition.  These complications could lead to system could face a number of potential problems, including In addition to its role in a number of financial used than LIBOR, the effective federal financial indexed swap, or OIS, contracts.  This widespread use could lead to complications if the publication of the effective federal there were a substantial contractual disputes-most notably, claims of contract frustration.  Under those conditions, the financial a reduction or elimination of liquidity and significant market uncertainty related to cash flows and valuations.

in the methodology could create problems for existing if the rate published by the Federal Reserve ceased to be viewed as of the effective fed funds rate.  The relevant contract law specific and uncertain, and so it is the precise conditions under which changes in methodology or could lead to claims of contract frustration.  However, on the basis of the the staff believes that the burden on a party seeking The scope of disruption is uncertain.  For example, a change or definition of the effective federal funds rate contracts consistent with the spirit doctrines are complex and their application is fact difficult to state definition limited set of contracts reviewed, judicial modification or termination of its contract on such grounds would be high.

The second the Federal Home Loan Banks could decide for a number of reasons the federal funds market.  Because nearly 90 market is made up of FHLBs lending to foreign the volume of trading.  Third, policies funds activity that we currently IOER, as is the case in some of the options that Jane highlighted, could funds rate to to other money market rates. Broadly speaking, there that could reduce the already limited volume in the federal funds market, possibly increasing the likelihood of encountering the issues that I have mentioned.  First, regulatory changes could make banks less willing to borrow market in order to earn the IOER rate.  For example, changes in regulations associated with Basel III could lead internationally active banks to find federal funds arbitrage possibility is that to limit or even stop their lending in percent of the brokered fed funds banks, such a decision could greatly reduce adopted during normalization could limit the federal see.  For example, offering overnight reverse repos to a broad set of counterparties at rates near further reduce fed funds trading volumes and lead the effective federal become more volatile and less tightly connected responses to these concerns, outlined in the for the federal funds trading that we these frameworks contemplate the use of an in relation to IOER or no There are several possible policy middle-right panel.  Policymakers could focus on near-term monetary policy frameworks that would not reduce the incentives currently see.  Generally speaking, overnight reverse repo facility at a relatively wide spread

First, the Federal Reserve could publish target a broader measure of overnight bank funding costs that would Eurodollars trade in a larger market, as seen in use of overnight reverse target rate it uses to communicate policy.  There regard, and use as a include both fed funds and Eurodollar transactions.  Such a rate would likely be more robust during normalization because the lower-right panel, with a broader range of participants.

Committee could choose to target a secured overnight rate, such as either the federal funds or the Eurodollar market and has a broader range rate is somewhat more sensitive to flight-tomoney market rates, so if this rate were to become the policy is that other money market rates could face greater upward pressure. Second, the the rate on overnight Treasury general collateral repo.  This market is substantially larger than of participants.  The Treasury repo quality flows than other target and the target were not reduced in the face of a flight-to-quality shock, it possible could be left such a target is that it would encompass a broad might therefore be an attractive alternative, as it flexibility around how tightly any one interest rate should move A third option would involve targeting a broad set of short-term interest rates. The target might be specified as a range or a weighted average, or it undefined.  An attractive feature of range of markets and participants.  It would provide some in response to a change in the target.

could consider adopting an administered rate as its policy rate on a standing to keep a selected market rate to the desired target.  If policymakers were willing to tolerate some deviation administered policy rate and market rates, using an administered rate as a Bank of England and the ECB. Finally, the Committee rate.  This could include, for example, the IOER rate or the overnight reverse repo facility.  A key benefit of an administered rate would be that policymakers could control it with certainty, which could be helpful in cases in which it may be operationally complex or otherwise difficult close between the target could provide more flexibility during normalization, while still providing clarity on the stance of policy.  Administered rates are used by other central banks, such as the to turn to Fabio for a discussion of some of the financiala fixed-rate, full-allotment overnight reverse repo facility.

Moreover, it additional flight-to-quality flows might occur because of the creation mechanisms for such flows include greater portfolio reallocations by MMF counterparties to the ON RRP government MMFs that MMFs or directly to the investors abroad.

Instead, imposing permanent but adjustable caps rarely bind in normal times, could address the financial-stability risk effectively. caps could be set for each investor, as is the case today, or at The cap could also be rigid, so that flexible, with some investment allowed above the cap, but at a lower The appropriate design would presumably depend on an assessment of the possible risks.

by discussing individual versus aggregate caps.  For individual caps, fixed limit on the amount they can invest.  For counterparties can invest up to $10 billion, but no more.  Or each its own individual limit-for example, based on historical program by the counterparty.  One could consider average take-up over a main benefit of investment. the facility cannot exceed rationed in some manner.  The main benefit of an aggregate that it would likely be tighter than the sum of individual caps. Let me start all counterparties could have the same example, today all counterparty could have usage of the recent period multiplied by, say, 1.5.  A counterparty that has invested $6 billion, on average, in the past would, thus, have a cap of $9 billion.  The individual caps is that counterparties know exactly how much they can invest.  In contrast, an aggregate cap would specify the maximum amount of total For example, it could specify that total take-up at $200 billion.  In the rare instances in which the sum of the bids exceeds the cap, the bids would have to be cap is rigid cap could not be breached, a negative rate.  For example, a counterparty could be allowed amount would earn rate of 5 basis points, or negative 10 basis points. Let me turn now to rigid versus flexible caps.  A as is the case today.  A counterparty cannot invest more than $10 billion at the facility.  A flexible cap could allow some investment above the cap but at a lower rate-conceivably, at to invest more than $10 billion, but each dollar above that 15 basis points less than the current

This could depend on what risk you are most to have a tight cap, to limit the potential for take-up, then a rigid aggregate cap may be appealing.  If your in a crisis, appealing.

IOER rate to 50 basis and then you asked about take-up at the overnight RRP facility.  What is the rate that MR. ENGLISH.  Sorry, just a clarifying point.  You said 'raise the points,' you would anticipate on the overnight RRPs?

Option 1, option 2, and option 3 left that very vague.  So perhaps me some sense of your thinking on option 2 and option 3.  I took option 3 as maybe that different from where we are, and option 2 as being maybe 10 basis points, or that.  But if you have a different idea of what option 2 and option 3 implied, it just to give me an idea of the sensitivity or the elasticity of take-up from MR. ROSENGREN. you can give a spread not something like would be really helpful these various options.

One thing to say first is that the estimate is going to depend on what you the frictions are that are keeping market rates lower than the IOER rate.  For example, if reason interest rates are low is predominantly due to balance sheet costs, then spread between the IOER and overnight RRP rates means that you are going to see in take-up that markets really are getting the IOER rate.  If you think that the main frictions are bargaining frictions or limited to see a reduction in the spread between market take-up.  And different people MR. MARTIN. think you think that the lowering the an increase in take-up.  And it is through the increase closer to competition frictions, then you should be able rates and the IOER rate without necessarily seeing any increase in have different views on what is happening.

is most important-and there might be other answers.  If we just rate by the same amount today, I think that it's what we have seen. Depending on which of these frictions frictions that would have a different effect-you would have different increased the IOER rate and the overnight RRP not obvious that we would see a large increase in take-up compared with One thing that could make a difference is that once the system becomes permanent, market

April 29-30, 2014

could decide to change some of their relationships.  And we already saw that increase to overnight RRP rate to be closer to the IOER rate, I think we would expect some that really depends on what we think the frictions are.  Once we have IOER arbitrage trade anymore, it is much more the take-up is going to be.  But it's likely to be large. participants happening in January when the exercise was extended for one year; so this could some extent.  And then once you reduce the spread-say, going from option 3 to option 2-and you get the increase in take-up, but made those two rates equal, so that there is no difficult to estimate what

maximum MR. POTTER.  President Rosengren, if it was Treasuries only, I think the would be $2.5 trillion, which would be very large.  And that-

MR. FISHER.  $2.5- that's what we would have to offer.  I mean, we would just a little bit. MR. POTTER.  Trillion, because have to shave that

We'd have to cap it there. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

there. MR. POTTER.  Yes.  We'd have to cap it

on a regular basis. MR. ROSENGREN.  So you would hit the caps

April 29-30, 2014

securities-only, subject to some other considerations. MR. POTTER.  No, that's the largest feasible amount-if we could operate with Treasury maximum.  But under option 1, what is MR. ROSENGREN.  I can understand that's the your best guess on average?

quarter-end.  My guess is, then, some of the banks are modeling this.  You would be from $750 billion to $1 trillion as the minimum amount of usage at the sheet cost the foreign banking organizations just need a spread of take-up.  If they need a spread of 10 MR. POTTER.  Well, we did $180 billion yesterday.  That was a rather large take-up outside of looking at somewhere equal rate-this is at the start-depending on which is the most important, the balance or the competitive aspect.  If it's true that 5 basis points, then you'd be at the lower end, I think, of that to 15 basis points, then the balance sheet cost would hit, as Antoine was saying, and you'd see larger take-up.

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So the answer is we don't really know.

We know one thing-that the longer it's been there, even though it's in a more usage there is as people get more used to using it.  And it's clear that the past week relative to the usual dynamics, we'd argue, which that it was $180 billion yesterday.  There are was that high.  The thing that we don't know is, if we move the rate up, how a large take-up.  Right now it's not really taking flows out of the banks, trying to understand is what those flows would look like, as Antoine was MR. POTTER. testing phase, the usage has been quite high over would be quarter-end.  I was personally surprised reasons why it quickly we would see and what the banks are saying.

You asked about options 1, 2, and 3.  So in option 1, IOER rate and the overnight RRP rate are equal.  In options 2 and 3-especially 3, in which MS. IHRIG.  Can I add something? the

April 29-30, 2014

the overnight RRP rate, but also the federal funds rate because, as Simon said, foreign may be get somewhat complicated when we try to much the take-up is going to be-because there are a lot of different rates, a lot of just those two administrative rates you asked about, there would also be other market rates that are going to help determine the take-up. you could have the federal funds market-then you have to think hard about not only the IOER rate and banks are the ones that are arbitraging the fed funds market with the money funds who using the overnight RRP rate.  So it actually does think of how moving parts in there.  In option 3, it's not but

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Bullard has a two-hander.

up on this a little bit, give the repo rate IOER rate.  Take-up is unpredictable, as you just discussed, but you put a cap on at is comfortable with.  Is there anything wrong with that are there good and bad aspects of that case? MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Just to follow me the pros and cons of the case in which you would pick option 1.  You'd set equal to the some fairly large size that the Committee case, or that we think that banks are really facing balance sheet cap in so that these balance sheet costs don't get eliminated, then you that different financial institutions are facing, and you would imagine that actions in order to reduce those costs or in order to more competitive.  And so you're likely not to have a level playing field, and I think we that you think that different kinds of institutions would like to not disadvantage banks in a way that would very large inequities. MR. MARTIN.  To the extent costs and that you put a have different costs banks are going to take some kind of evasive be would be concerned about that.  So to the extent are facing different costs, I think we create potentially

fully mitigating it.  It would be fully mitigated if you let the take-up be full. MR. BULLARD.  You'd be mitigating their situation, but by putting a cap on, you wouldn't be

April 29-30, 2014

costs-for example, the necessarily have to. MR. MARTIN.  That's right, yes.  In addition there are some FDIC assessment fee-that would remain present and the banks would have to pay, but that the extended set of counterparties would not

But still the Committee could make a judgment that there's a limit on much of this we want to do, and some inefficiencies are going to be left in the market, and MR. BULLARD. how that's the way it's going to be.

right. MR. MARTIN.  That's exactly

If I could follow up for a moment, I think there are two issues that the that if the rate on the overnight RRPs the reason of the FDIC premium costs and other costs the rate would be at a level that would lead to extra demand for the overnight RRPs. MR. ENGLISH. Committee would have to trade off in that case.  One is were the same as the IOER rate, for banks face, you might end up with a whole lot of overnight RRPs and not a lot of reserves.  If you put a cap on, then you'd have to ration who gets the overnight RRPs and who doesn't because the that you'd have to think about is that if you set a high cap-if you had a overnight RRPs-you'd be doing a whole lot of transacting and a whole lot of your traditional arena, which is the banking sector. The other factor whole lot of policy implementation through the nonbank part of the financial sector.  I think some parts of the Committee might be unhappy with that-operating so much with money funds and with GSEs, and not operating in the

CHAIR YELLEN.  Two-hander?

On this issue of or aversion to doing too much quantity with the nonbank sector, with the money an optical issue.  There are financialhad a very, very interesting suggestion in one of our staff MR. STEIN.  Actually, it's a direct follow-up to this, if I might. discomfort with fund sector-I understand it, and I think it's more than just stability considerations as well.  We

April 29-30, 2014

recall.  In principle, you could imagine restricting our counterparties not to potentially go away.  I am interested in whether folks who discussions, if you'll money funds broadly, but to money funds that invest only with us or money funds that invest only in Treasury securities, in which case some of these inequity issues go away, and I think some of the financial-stability issues know about this think that's a feasible option and what its operational challenges would be.

any operational challenges. MR. POTTER.  It doesn't have a that we've signed up now are not government-only is that simply because we are not money funds doesn't mean that they're not going to be MR. ENGLISH.  I have two reactions, and I think Simon may have others.  One is that lot of our money market fund counterparties money funds.  You would have to exclude them.  The other transacting directly with the prime affected by what we do.

MR. STEIN.  Sure.

will move from the prime money funds to the government-only financial-stability issue of what money funds to the government-only just isn't obviously an improvement in terms of the financial-stability MR. ENGLISH.  Funds funds with which we're transacting.  So, for example, to take the would happen when there are runs, it's not clear to me that you'd actually be better off in that case.  You'd still have people running from the prime money funds, and it implications.

the portfolio reallocation, because you would restrict the that we'd be facing, but it's not obvious we'd be money funds to this facility, likely to occur at a higher speed than the portfolio reallocation. MR. NATALUCCI.  Essentially, you have the channel I was discussing before.  It might take care of one thing, which is portfolio holdings of these money funds addressing the second piece, which is the outflows from the prime which appear

April 29-30, 2014

Oh, absolutely.   It's not a substitute for the capping mechanism.  It's an comfort issue. MR. STEIN. ex ante answer is that, operationally, it's very easy to do.  Just MR. POTTER.  But the clearest take them off the list.

I have one quick follow-up on President Bullard's suggestion.  One of that discussed caps is the idea of having a single-price as a way of implementing the cap.  So you can imagine the situation in which you'd set RRP rates equal.  You'd set a cap, and you'd design the overnight RRP auction, and then you would get a wedge between the IOER rate and the market-determined spread.  So that would be MR. MARTIN. the things that we discussed in the memo auction the IOER and overnight as a single-price effective overnight RRP rate, but that would be a one way of running option 1.

YELLEN.  President Fisher, did you have a two-hander? CHAIR

I just want a clarification here.  As I recall, we're dealing with 94 or so many of those are government-only? MR. FISHER. money market funds.  How

But the fungibility issues are germane.  We should bear in mind what MR. FISHER. happens in a panic.  You'd have flows that

YELLEN.  Yes.  We're still with President Rosengren.  [Laughter]  He's still got we're encouraging follow-up. CHAIR the floor, but

April 29-30, 2014

option 1 is there's rate that's been chosen, and Antoine gave you a way that the market would determine rate.  That has some clarity attached to it, as compared with having more than one rate. MR. POTTER.  To President Bullard's point, one of the advantages of just one this other

I have just one last follow-up, and then I'll cede the floor-a the extent that a lot of the prime money market funds are rates at the money market funds would no longer be feasible, and we would move to a money market sense, from a a likely we followed up on Jeremy's suggestion, assuming that Europe is not going to be in a raising rates at a time that we're raising rates? MR. ROSENGREN. follow-up to Jeremy's question.  To invested in European bank debt instruments and Europe is presumably not raising time that we are-if we followed up on Jeremy's suggestion, one possible outcome would be that prime fund industry that's primarily focused on government-only funds.  In some financial-stability standpoint, that might be an optimal solution.  Do you think that is outcome if position of

Remember, it's dollar rates that we're talking about.  So the fact that they're European, they're still borrowing to fund their dollar assets.  So it's dollar rate that really applies. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. despite the rates get expensive relative to theirs, they may not to have as big a dollar exposure as they had before, right? MR. ROSENGREN.  But as our decide

DUDLEY. Well, they have to finance their dollar book of assets. their borrowing here in dollars.  It doesn't really matter what the VICE CHAIRMAN That's really what's motivating European rates are.

their dollar asset holdings and therefore their need for dollar funding. MR. ENGLISH.  President Rosengren may have in mind that the European banks would reduce

April 29-30, 2014

my question is, is that a likely outcome or not-do you think the money market funds would continue to exist the way they are? MR. ROSENGREN.  So prime

MR. ENGLISH.  Nobody knows; it's just not clear.

reach for more in that world, in which they don't have access to the overnight RRP facility.  So some way of controlling that. MR. POTTER.  I think it certainly cuts both ways, in the sense that they might yield even you'd want in the States, as our is an offsetting factor, too.  So their demand for dollar funding MR. KAMIN.  European banks might also be doing more business economy picks up, and so that might not fall.

YELLEN.  Okay.  Thank you.  President Fisher. CHAIR

Chair.  I will confess that I'm one of the dimmer at this table, so I have a very basic question.  Right now we have excess reserves, and to what that means is, if you look at what the demands for reserves are to meet reserve required for liquidity requirements-which is changing-or clearing needs, we agree that right now we have excess.  Is that correct? MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Madam bulbs me, requirements, if you look at what is for

$2.3, $2.4 trillion. MR. POTTER.

'normalization,' I want to make sure we're all talking and controlling short-term rates.  To me, normalization is that banks find their end-ofrequirements, liquidity requirements, or talking about?  I just want to make sure we have a common don't know what those numbers are, but my question was What is that?  It's not $2½ trillion, or $2-point-something trillion. MR. FISHER.  So when we say about what normalization is.  Normalization, to me, is not just stopping large-scale asset purchases day positions closer to their demands for reserve clearing needs.  Is that what we are understanding.  Ultimately, and we going to be:

April 29-30, 2014

We're going to raise interest rates are still large. MR. ENGLISH.  I think we would make a distinction between two things.  One is normalizing rates-that is, beginning to raise interest rates. when reserve balances the ultimate goal should be what I just mentioned, MR. FISHER.  I understand that.  But I would think.

will mean normalization, if you like, of our balance That takes longer; in the Tealbook projections, it takes five years or something like that. I think, is subject to discussion by this level of reserves and a has been suggested that we might want to go to a long-run regime in assets, and so we'd be running with a bigger raises a number that the Committee would need to consider. MR. ENGLISH.  In the long run, it sheet. And, exactly what that normalized balance sheet is, Committee.  Do you want to go back to a long-run regime with a very low level of excess reserves, implementing policy the way it used to be done?  You could also go to a long-run policy implementation regime that's a floor regime with a much higher bigger balance sheet.  It which we'd be supplying a lot of short-run safe balance sheet if we did that.  So I think the long-run balance sheet normalization of additional questions my point.  By the way, with my personal priors, it's going to take MR. FISHER.  This is more than five years.  Let's set that aside.

Simon, I think that's yours, too. MR. ENGLISH.

long term.

MR. FISHER.  It's a

MR. ENGLISH.  Yes.

make make sure you understand, I realize it is going to take a MR. FISHER.  But I think that's where you start and you back your way down.  I'll this point in the go-round, but just to

April 29-30, 2014

This is an issue we created; and now we're trying to solve it and do so in a manner.  Unless you know what the endpoint is, I don't think you can decide what the Otherwise we're going to get into trouble along the way.  So to me well.  That's issue.  And I might add-and forgive me for saying this-but due to the that we have, which the economic literature did not prepare us for, we have yet. very long time. thoughtful intermediate points are. that's an important definition, Madam Chair, and Bill just framed the questions very what we need to determine first, in my opinion, and, as you mentioned earlier, we have a long time between now and September, but it's actually a very short period of time given the complexity of this complexity of the tools have to achieve a level of understanding that I don't think we the presentation.  Exhibit 2 was particularly helpful just in terms of But we'd better figure out the one of those several options, then that gives us a sense of direction. I appreciate dimension-or 'dementia,' whichever you wish to use.  [Laughter] what our long-term definition of normalization is, and then we back in from there.  That's point I wish to make.  If it's

matter where long run, no matter what the policy implementation looks like that's going to be around $3 trillion, and we have to think about how we can and effectively do that.  And I think you could do that in a variety of wouldn't necessarily have implications for where you want to be in 2030.  There are memo that talks some about that, but I think there's a fair flexibility between what you choose to do in 2015 and where you want to be in 2030. MR. ENGLISH.  I want to push back a little against that, because I think no the Committee wants to be in the in 2030, you're going to be raising rates-I hope, if everything goes as we think-next year with a level of reserves successfully, efficiently, ways, and it some links there, and we provided a amount of don't dispute back of our mind.  We are not at MR. FISHER.  Bill, we have a lot of liquidity that we have to deal with.  I that.  But I'm just saying we need to at least keep that in the

But the toolkit that we use for that has to be longer-term principles.  That's my point.  So it's not a difference of opinionjust really trying to get a definition on the table. odds here.  We're just trying to figure out and, again, bear in mind the endpoint, define it.  And we're still going to have to deal with the fact that, one hopes, things go well, the economy strengthens, and we are going to have to raise rates. kept in line with it's

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Rosengren?

I have a two-hander on that.  I just think we should be agnostic is, because if we decide to go with a reverse repo facility, until we have magnitudes and volume and how much it is going to vary, I have no idea whether reverse repo facility would be a feasible solution in the long run or not.  But if it is, then that a federal funds will be.  I actually think the opposite.  I don't think we know the endpoint until we know MR. ROSENGREN. about what the endpoint some idea of the is going to imply a much larger balance sheet than we would have if we go with rate, and I don't think we have to decide that until we know how successful the reverse repo facility how some of these other tools work.

in one or two years we learn are really feasible, and then we have the discussion about what we think right solution in 2030.  But I don't think we should prejudge it in September-I think that until we have a better understanding of how the tools work. So I would be more interested in taking the approach that which of these options is the prejudging it would be dangerous tools MR. FISHER.  Well, clearly, we need to get a better understanding of how all the work.  And we are testing.  Again, there is no dispute here.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman Dudley.

DUDLEY.  I would like to land slightly between the two of you that I think it is relevant to have a path back to the long-term framework. VICE CHAIRMAN [laughter], in the sense

April 29-30, 2014

that then rules out a path back to a given framework, that's relevant.  So rule out a path in the long term.  And as long as you're comfortable that you're not ruling longer term, then I think you can really try to optimize over the short term. If we pick a certain path you have to be comfortable that whatever path we pick in the near term doesn't that you might prefer out a path for the That's how I would look at it.

it's pretty difficult right now to rule out any with the options that are there, because the way the tools will work will change as the is nothing in any of the that prevents you from either going back to the old system or going to a new system. MR. POTTER.  I think our view was that path balance sheet starts to fall anyway, and we will learn quite a lot.  There five options

I think there is a path back to any longer-term that you should optimize over the short to medium term, VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. framework.  So that would suggest recognizing that you do have a path back.

Yes.  There are costs, obviously, of switching frameworks frequently, those in mind. MR. POTTER. and we should bear

MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Bill.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Evans, two-hander.

One thing that I think I heard somewhere in the presentation or in the questions and was that the take-up by money funds is going to depend in part on the perceived testing of this, at some juncture we are going to have to make a representation that we haven't figured that out or we are going to have to commit MR. EVANS.  Thank you.  I'm sympathetic to the flexibility that has been described right here. answers permanence of this facility.  So in the either to permanence-aren't we?

We have it through January 2015 based on the resolution that you passed MR. POTTER. last time.

market fund's with both feet, go in and recruit customers for this, thinking 'I want to this.' MR. EVANS.  I'm sorry-I interpreted the permanence as a money willingness to actively, make sure I've got 10 years of looking at the choices that are made over the next few how permanent the overnight RRP is.  If some of those choices are facility, we those flows would look like in the current situation.  If they is going to be part of the permanent framework, that will allow them to think about the right now and some of the other relationships they might MR. POTTER.  People will be months to think about announced at the September meeting, and if the choice is to keep the overnight RRP will learn more about what some of feel it counterparty relationships they have want to get to use that facility.

want to return to the financial-stability We had a panel in exhibit 3, on the lower left, on possible amplification effects.  And then to lower the overnight repo rate.  And it reliable stand-alone tool.'  So I'm going to ask Mr. Martin, why is that not that maybe the policy MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I issue. for potential mitigants, on the lower right, the first one is says, 'probably not a a reliable tool?  It sounded to me like the description that you gave was decision wouldn't be the right one in that circumstance.  To me, that's maybe not a good description, because you are talking to the policy committee.  [Laughter]

What I meant to say was that even the most enlightened policymakers getting the timing exactly right.  One thing you could consider doing is to MR. MARTIN. might have a hard time say, 'Well, we're going to monitor the situation.  And when we think that there is going to be a

April 29-30, 2014

lower the rate.'  I think that's difficult to do, and there is this worry that if you do run, we'll indeed lower the rate, people might say, 'Oh, my God.  These guys know something that we should know, too.'  And you create a run.

a problem in any kind of crisis situation. MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  But that's a cap, if I might say so, is that you have initial onboarding, the initial surge.  And then you can manage that cap and can lower the rate after the cap has been reached, or you can decide is what I meant by saying have the rate at a facility exactly right, you might just be off by a day or two, and that could be MR. MARTIN.  But one of the nice things about the ability to stop the manage that rate.  So you that you keep the rate fixed but you maintain the cap at its existing value, or you increase it.  You have a lot more flexibility.  But what you're worried about-and this that it might not be a sufficiently robust standalone tool-is that if you need to always interest damaging.

might be very difficult to find a rate that prevents people wanting money with the Fed.  It's safe; the Fed can return the money to them.  In some severe world, their private counterparty might not be able to return the money to them. MR. POTTER.  Also, it to put their states of the insensitive. MR. MARTIN.  And people become very rate

-which we saw in September 2008. MR. POTTER.

One point that was in the memo and that, in my view, is important is that move because of auction or whatever-to always be in place.  You don't want there to be a switch that market participants.  So to be part of the furniture.  Maybe these things hit at the end of every quarter, when MR. ENGLISH. that you want these mitigants-whatever they are, caps, rates approaches somebody has to turn because that is then very bad news, potentially, for you want it

April 29-30, 2014

becomes something that we are we know that usage of this thing is going to go up.  So it just used to and isn't that big a deal.

a policy rule that reacted would all be possible.  And then, in that case, lowering the rate would be mitigant, and you would offset any probability of crisis.  You are just saying there is MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  But, still, what I would think of is partly to a financial crisis-type variable, and, in principle, that policy rule would be exactly the right one, and then that a sufficient some noise around that, and in a crisis situation that might be a problem.

right.  In normal times, we should expect that adjusting the interest-rate insensitive, it might not be enough just to change the rate, to have something else, like a belt and suspenders.  But, in general, if you rate enough-if you can turn it negative-it is going to reduce flows. MR. MARTIN.  Yes.  That's rate of the overnight RRP facility would be a very effective tool.  Specifically, in times of crises and when people become and you might want lower the

an auction in which the demand to be, and you have a reserve price.  So on a normal day, you are just hitting turns out to be the market setting the quantity, and us capping the quantity with the market MR. STEIN.  I think, Bill, what you were just describing sounds like you are basically, on every single day, auctioning off something like 120 percent of what you expect the reserve price.  That is the rate that we set.  And if the demand at the auction bigger, then the market sets the price.  So you just seamlessly move back and forth between us setting the price with setting the price.  And, as you said, if you did this on a regular basis, you wouldn't have to change tools.

It seems quite seamless.

MR. STEIN.

of some moving average or something.  You may also want to say 'and no more seems MR. ENGLISH.  You may want also to have some sort of overall cap.  You said, I think, 120 percent than' something.  I think the mechanism design is a question, but something like that right.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota.

When I thought about these mitigants for financial crises I myself in the position of being in this room or on a videoconference call in the wonder to what extent things like caps and a commitment to rate in the time of crisis would be credible when you're reading stories in the mutual funds with people's savings, et cetera, looking for safety, a place to put their money, while the Federal Reserve has the ability to offer that and choosing not to-and in fact it is penalizing people for seeking safety.  I think it would put MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. tried to put middle of one of these crises.  And I lower the newspaper about money market looking for it is us in a very challenging situation at that point in time.

monetary instrument for people to use when the supply of that instrument was time that there were structural, legal impediments to the elastic MR. LACKER.  I'd like to follow up on President Kocherlakota's comments.  There is a rich irony to this discussion.  As some of you have heard me point out before, we were founded to provide a inelastic-when they wanted to get their deposits out and have hand-to-hand currency to carry around.  It was well known at the supply of currency under the National Bank Act.  We were founded to provide that elastic supply

with that it's just odd and a bit dissonant to be thinking about limiting that of currency to people panicking who were taking their money out of banks.  So I agree President Kocherlakota flow.

founding caused to spring to my mind a question that we or limiting the size of one of the array of fleers have to flee to.  They have other options to flee to.  And I'm wondering what to us, that leads you to want a certain point.  I'm just confused about the analytical framework for these Thinking about the parallel with our about why you would restrict a flight to safety.  The broad philosophy here seems to be can help financial stability by taking off the table options that information you have about those other options, and their inferiority them to come in at limits being a good response.

way he described what you trying to limit the supply of the safe asset over the longer run. effect from people rushing That's the financial-stability cost that we see if the overnight RRP facility really is MR. POTTER.  I think Antoine set it up quite nicely in the were trying to do.  You weren't You were trying to limit, over one to five days, say, a very disruptive to safe assets. a perfectly elastic supply of that safe asset.  And that's the way you tried to pose the issue, I think.

assets they could disruptively flee to at MR. LACKER.  Are there going to be no other the time?

ask the Treasury not to supply more Treasury them to declare a new Treasury auction.  This is MR. POTTER.  They could flee to Treasury bills, which are in fixed supply.  One of the thought experiments we did was to ask, would we bills at this time?  And it's sort of surprising for a standing facility, in theory that they have used, which is available, and one day a big shock

April 29-30, 2014

that we should be providing a safe asset over the longer run. might come, and you get a very disruptive funding change from the facility being there, which is based on the genuine desire

I'm thinking about this?  I kind of feel your pain.  In against risky assets that banks have-provide they would then satisfy depositors with.  We could do something money markets across our balance sheet.  People want safe assets; we give them CPFF, whatever-to provide the funding.  Again, we would and providing a safe asset.  I think that's the equivalent the Congress has said through the Dodd-Frank Act that it is not that happy the Committee may not want to do.  So up a structure for implementing monetary policy that would require you of money markets across our balance sheet in a way that requires these MR. ENGLISH.  Can I tell you how the traditional world, we would, in effect, lend them with currency, say, that similar in today's financial sector-it's a much more complicated financial sector-by basically intermediating safe assets with the overnight RRPs.  But this disintermediates a bunch of borrowers, and we could use tools-the TSLF, PDCF, be taking, in some sense, risky collateral of the traditional procedure of providing currency to banks during a crisis.  The problem is actually getting the funds out to the appropriate parties quickly and efficiently.  And actually doing that, because with us doing that anyway, seems like something that you may not want to set to intermediate a bunch tools you may not be comfortable with.

So if there had been a the riskiest things.  They were the safest things.  They were risky, had. MR. LACKER.  You're combining two things.  You're combining credit and money policy.  We could do this across Treasuries, right-holding Treasuries? huge supply of Treasuries outstanding in 1914, we could have increased the supply of money elastically without holding private assets.  And the assets we took from banks were the safest things they had.  They weren't but they were the safest things banks

April 29-30, 2014

the central bank provides liquidity against illiquid MR. ENGLISH.  But traditionally assets.  That's the point.

many different ways.  But at the core we We're issuing a Treasury to the market and using the instrument.  But I separate those two, and I don't think we have to MR. LACKER.  Well, one can read 'tradition' supply liabilities, and when we choose to pick up a private asset when we could have bought a Treasury, we're doing fiscal policy. proceeds for a private credit do them both.

it would be possible in a crisis for us to provide through the overnight RRP facility and then do RPs to get the reserve balances back day, Simon goes in and he does a lot of RPs to get the reserves back out might work, but I think you'd end up with a lot of would-be borrowers who were came to our overnight RRP facility who didn't have OMOa choice.  You can lend against the non-OMO-eligible MR. ENGLISH.  So you might think that safe assets out.  So at the end of the again.  That unable to get funding because folks eligible collateral.  Then you've got collateral or not.

You're well aware this is a broad philosophical discussion.  Lending even more difficult in times of stress. MR. LACKER. decisions are difficult in normal times.  They're why we're trying to avoid that, right?  That's monetary policy implementation. MR. ENGLISH.  Absolutely.  That's exactly why we're saying caps or something like that may be necessary, to avoid having to make lending decisions as part of your

you Treasury securities and a flight to this overnight MR. LACKER.  But we didn't have private-sector instruments in the discussion until brought them in here.  We were talking about instrument collateralized by Treasuries.

April 29-30, 2014

it's flight from something. time money market funds were funding banks, were funding broker-dealers, were Tractor, and now they're not.  Now they're coming to our overnight out there who need funding. MR. ENGLISH.  But as the memo said and as Fabio said, There was a funding, say, Caterpillar RRP facility.  And so there are those thing.  I mean, you're interposing your judgment about who MR. LACKER.  It's a classic deserves funding on day 1, day 2, day 3.

There are three channels in some sense, right?  One is just portfolio size and shape of the industry, how they would reallocate the existing of flows out of, say, prime money funds, so the money comes into that face the ON RRP facility.  There's the issue of where they when they are funding, they are doing other MR. NATALUCCI. reallocation-given the portfolio.  This is an issue these government-only funds have taken money away from, and this could be assets.  Some of them could be nontraditional collateral, for example, so it would need to require other funding.

market participants, which is that, should a set up funds that focus RRPs.  That could be a new tool that would be in their suite liquidity management for clients.  That's a new channel in which money would move.  And I it's unclear, but the dynamic is different.  In some sense, in the dynamic you were action that make the flows into safe assets more costly without mitigants, either caps or moving the overnight RRP rate.  In this case, there is this with a fixed rate that becomes higher than market rates.  So that will even more flows just by differential spreads. Another issue has come up with a bunch of facility become permanent, some asset managers could essentially entirely, 100 percent, on overnight of agree that describing, in which people go to Treasury securities, the Treasury yield responds, as Antoine was saying.  So you get the price any sort of infinitely elastic supply attract

April 29-30, 2014

that we can let the private sector welfareto provide a safe asset.  The private sector knows it's there.  It's their problem to that fair? MR. POTTER.  But I think President Lacker's point is solve that problem, and-is this correct, President Lacker?-our role, if we think it's enhancing, is solve.  Is

Yes, I'm questioning the premise that that wouldn't work effectively. MR. LACKER.

MR. POTTER.  Yes.

LACKER.  And I also have questions about the premise that, to the extent that we relevant, because there are so many from a given fund or a given credit instrument. MR. see that as problematic, depriving people of an option is other ways they can flee

MR. POTTER.  Correct.

their ability to flee. MR. LACKER.  I just don't see us as being critical to

The private-sector participants, when we spoke to them, did think that a elastic supply in this form did raise this risk more.  It's one of the reasons we focused MR. POTTER. perfectly on it.

Dudley. CHAIR YELLEN.  Two-handers.  Vice Chairman me give you my take on this, which I hope will at least for me.  I agree with President Lacker that, if people want safe with those safe assets, that's probably utility enhancing as opposed safe assets at a fixed price, what's going to happen in are going to go down, interest rates in the that in the old and those on risky assets go up, but they both move.  In this VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Let clarify things a little bit, assets and we provide them to utility reducing.  But if we supply them this new regime is that the prices of risky assets economy are going to go up, and financial conditions are going to tighten as a consequence of this flow.  The difference between the old regime and this new regime would be regime yields on risk-free assets fall

April 29-30, 2014

risk-free assets doesn't go down, and so the yield on risky assets goes conditions. new regime, the yield on up by more.  So you get a tightening of financial by lowering your interest rate structure.  But I That's the financial-stability negative that we have to think about.  Now, you could respond to it by living with it.  You could respond to it by adding reserves through doing repurchase agreements.  You could respond to it think that the initial reaction, relative to the current regime, would be a tightening of financial conditions, and that's really the consequence on the other side.

that happens. MR. LACKER.  But, Bill, we always cut rates when something like

Well, that would be an option. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

strong anyway.  Open MR. LACKER.  And besides, Treasury rates are going to be market rates on Treasury securities are going to be strong.

the financial-stability issues are conditions that you would be concerned about.  And the question is, what's the best VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I actually agree.  I think really quite complicated because there's a good, in the sense that you're offering an asset that they want to hold, which is utility enhancing, but there's a bad-there's a temporary tightening of financial way to address that?

two days, you don't want to magnify some MR. POTTER.  And particularly over one or of these flows that people don't understand.  I think that's what we're trying to avoid with the capping.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  For two-handers, President Kocherlakota, then President Fisher, then Governor Tarullo.

I was making earlier in the hope understand the financial-stability concern that Vice Chairman Dudley MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I'm going to restate the point of being clearer.  I

But I do before September.  So it's that we, wherever we can, try to figure out a bit more rigorously what we need in September or sometime later and explain what MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I think I'm I'm interesting discussion is doing between now and September.  I think there is going to be a theme that is going to continue in this have an eye think it unlikely that this group is going to come to a consensus on that pretty important to decide in order to enable the Chair to go out it is that we're doing.

I'd make, and this is consistent with what Richard just said, is Dudley explained a I think that people are taking into accountfrom us took into account-is that we are mindful of financial-stability concerns, and this potential reorientation of the The only other comment that one way or another the financial-stability dynamic that Vice Chairman minute ago is going to be with us.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Let's see.  Now I'm going back to the original list of Vice Chairman Dudley. CHAIR questions, and I have

DUDLEY.  I had a question for Antoine.  Maybe it's more of an have one important difference from aggregate your demand curve was and what your prices were, while if you had a system of individual a quantity-based system.  So my question is, it doesn't seem like the lot simpler.  That's a VICE CHAIRMAN observation.  It seems to me that individual caps caps.  With aggregate caps you presumably would have to have a submission of a schedule of what caps it would just be individual-cap-based system has the benefit of being operationally a leading question, obviously.  [Laughter]

the individual cap is simpler for the participant, but more for us to put into place. MR. MARTIN.  I think complicated for us to implement, and Josh might have something to say about that.  The aggregate cap is going to require a little bit more thinking on the part of the participants.  I think it's easier we needed to, but to do it in a robust, automated fashion would take us a fair amount MR. FROST.  That's right.  In today's world, we could implement individual caps tomorrow if of time.

me just add something in terms of why the sum of the individual tight than an aggregate cap.  There are a couple of things.  First, we have a of participants that just don't use the facility very much.  They would likely have a minimis MR. MARTIN.  And let caps might be less number de amount.

April 29-30, 2014

DUDLEY.  I understand that.  It just seems to me, though, that what they want at different prices, which seems much.' VICE CHAIRMAN people are going to have to submit a schedule of like a much more complicated process to do every day than just saying, 'I want this have the advantage that then the overnight RRP is allocated whereas if you have an aggregate cap and some way of a more system. MR. ENGLISH.  It does across participants more efficiently, allocating through an auction or something, as Jeremy was talking about earlier, it's efficient

But it also seems to me a question of how often you these prices for the once-in-five-years maybeVICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. think that this cap is actually going to be binding.  If you thought it was once every five years, you probably don't want to have them submitting all event.  If you think it's going to be binding every quarter, then never binds or almost never binds, and if whenever the cap is not binding everybody gets the maximum bid rate, going to bid the amount we want because in all likelihood it's not binding.'  So the when they think it is going to hit, but that's precisely when much they need that liquidity. MR. MARTIN.  It also means if they believe it we have a rule that says then they really don't need to make any of these complicated decisions.  They would just say, 'We're just complicated part really comes about we want them to think about how

whether the are likely to be important from option 1 all the way to option 4?  I'm thinking of Governor question about whether we need to have this discussion about caps in order to get to a facility is in options 1 through 4.  So I think we MR. EVANS.  Just because I heard the term 'caps,' and I'm curious about caps Tarullo's September agreement, but the overnight RRP need a point of view on this.

April 29-30, 2014

on how important the financial-stability issue VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It depends is.

Because there, presumably, the funds rate MR. EVANS.  So in option 4, is it important? is more important, and it's a smaller ON RRP.

MR. POTTER.  No, it would still have the same issue.

MR. EVANS.  So caps are always important.

problem. MR. POTTER.  Also, in option 5, if you have the term RRP, and you just happen to be auctioning on that day, depending on how you do it, it would still be a caps as being able to adjust over time. spread between the IOER and rates, it would still not likely bind.  In all normal situations, you would have these in place; and, in all likelihood, they wouldn't bind.  In that sense, all these options have MR. MARTIN.  I think you want to think of the So that, again, in normal times, even if we tied them to the overnight RRP caps them in place, but they are not affecting the way you implement monetary policy, except in times of acute stress.

Let me restate, perhaps, Governor Tarullo's question on a different topic. so many of the subjects here have a greater level of complexity by an or things we going to have to sort through that level of complexity by a September That's the question. MR. EVANS. It strikes me that caps and order of magnitude compared with so many of the other monetary policy institutions that we talk about.  Are timeframe?

think that's quite right.  We have caps in place right now.  The run floor systems basically have caps.  And if you go above that cap, you get a MR. POTTER.  I don't two countries that lower rate.

April 29-30, 2014

that would be pretty easy for us to be difficult to make it completely quickly.  The deeper nonbank sector-it matters in three months. The choices we have here are engineering-type choices work on over the next three months.  Operationally, it might robust in three months, but we have a lot of capacity to get it rolling quite issues regarding financial stability and how you should interact with the would be surprising if you solved those

YELLEN.  Let's see, we are back to further questions, and I think I see President CHAIR Lacker on the list.

that rates 'probably' won't go up one-for-one when we rate, but you said 'potentially.'  And then, Josh, when you were talking about Basel III-I thought you said that meant unprofitable at certain rates, and there they were profitable.  So for the federal funds rate-IOER arbitrage, do find to be a breakeven spread? MR. LACKER.  Yes.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have questions for Josh and Jane.  In your presentation, Jane, exhibit 1 says raise the IOER these regulatory balance sheet costs-the FDIC charge and they'd make them unprofitable, but I assume you would be rates at which you have a sense of what the magnitude of those costs amounts to for a bank?  What would a typical large commercial bank that are not 5 basis points.  So if you factor in an average FDIC 10 basis points for most MR. FROST.  I think what we've heard from some of the foreign banks subject to the FDIC fee has been about assessment charge, which, I think, for the past few quarters has been 7 to of the larger banks-

MR. LACKER.  So you get 12 to 15.

that. MR. FROST.  Yes, 12, 15, something like to add in how the leverage ratio might affect some of memo in which we MR. POTTER.  And then you have the large banks within the United States.  That was discussed in the cover

April 29-30, 2014

talking to us in the way they tend to when there are new regulations. reissued the framework discussion from last year.  And that, you know, could be quite large when you talk to some of the banks.  They view that as a pretty big constraint.  It could just be the banks

MR. LACKER.  Right, right.

a large bank, it will be quite ratios that we're talking about. MR. POTTER.  But it is also possible that, if it's binding for expensive, at the rate.  It doesn't seem to me like they are going to vary when we raise IOER rate.  Does it?  Do you think they would?  Would they go up, or would that be just a MR. LACKER.  So here is the question.  Those costs would drive a wedge between the funds rate and the IOER the constant, you know, X number of basis points wedge?

That could be the case, that it's just a constant spread.  And so if you're the IOER rate.  You might not actually have to MS. IHRIG. happy with that spread, then you could increase drain very much, even in option 5.  But the point is, we just don't know.

You don't know of any reason why those wedges would widen, right?  I widen when the rate goes up, right? MR. LACKER. mean, the FDIC thing, that doesn't past year, the IOER-federal funds rate does vary from day to day.  So I don't want to say the spread is going to be a constant as today.  Over the past year, I think the average spread has been 15 basis points, but it MS. IHRIG.  Well, if you look over, say, even the spread of what it is has moved up and down.

was much lower.  So it has varied quite a MR. POTTER.  And the year before the spread lot.

MR. LACKER.  Okay.

April 29-30, 2014

say, we don't know for sure.  There are a lot of we don't know for sure here, and it could be that raising the IOER rate would be raise the funds rate more or less along with the IOER rate.  It would be a brave IOER rate to 50 basis points,' and you the IOER rate to 50 basis points, and the funds rate went up much less than 25 basis would be a problem. MR. ENGLISH.  But to be fair, as you things that sufficient to decision by the Committee to do that, I think, because if you announced, 'Okay-we're tightening, everybody; here it goes; we're raising the raised points, that we the spread might remain constant. MR. LACKER.  I understand that the future is uncertain, but the arbitrage is a reason have to believe that

MR. ENGLISH.  Yes.

was just probing to see if there was any reason to believe it might the general uncertainty that clouds all of us when we think about the future. MR. LACKER.  And I not, besides

Well, because it has varied quite a lot. MR. POTTER.

a lot, too, from day to day. MR. PLOSSER.  The funds rate varied quite that this would be a pretty predictable relationship, rates by raising the interest rate on excess just won't be as controlled as using some of these other tools. MR. POTTER.  No, I'm talking about just the average level over a certain period of time. That seems to vary in a way.  It is possible and I think all the staff think that you could raise reserves.  It

To add to that, you know, you don't have to specify a federal funds rate. MS. IHRIG. You could specify a federal funds range.

MR. LACKER.  Right, you could maintain a range.

MS. IHRIG.  And so the range can help you with that worry.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Evans.

April 29-30, 2014

question in.  The list is short. MR. EVANS.  Wow.  I just put that money funds develop these special short-term safe funding for certain types of activities. of activities are going to be diminished by this?  Is there a sense in which credit banking system going to somehow look smaller if we have will it be unchanged?  More broadly, who are the losers in a How loudly will they be talking to other people-vested interests, that?  Can you paint a little bit more of a picture of what that looks like? Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have a sort of longer-term-perspective question.  If we have a vibrant overnight reverse repo program, if investment funds, and if they draw in funding on a large scale there, I'm assuming that, alternatively, those funds were going to go somewhere else.  Somebody else isn't going to have a fund available for that, and that fund is providing some What types intermediation to nonfinancial enterprises might be affected adversely?  I would hope not.  That would be a big issue.  Is the shadow something like that?  Or development like that? political lobbies-about

This would be with a reasonably large take-up of the overnight RRP MR. POTTER. facility?

MR. EVANS.  Yes.  Let's go that far.

The first-order effect will be that fewer reserves will be held overnight with the Fed.  So it will change the composition of the liabilities of the don't think it should have a direct effect on will have to do with which rates you are setting around There are versions of option 1 in which it's a little bit mysterious to us move into the overnight RRP facility, you could have trillions of into the overnight RRP facility.  That might have some effect on banks, in the MR. POTTER. by the banking system Fed, and the Fed might have a view about that.  I credit formation.  The first-order effect here on credit formation. exactly what would happen in the financial system, because instead of having $300 billion to $400 billion of reserves reserves move

April 29-30, 2014

that leave them.  And that could be a structure them to provide credit in the short run. short run, definitely, as they deal with deposits that makes it harder for clarify something, President Evans.  The first-order aside all sorts of other stuff, would be as follows:  What you have now is no necessary implication for flows of funding to other folks in that isn't disruptiveis a reason to think that there are big losers.  I mean, there are losers because MR. ENGLISH.  I just wanted to effect, leaving depositors holding deposits at a bank and the bank holding reserves with us.  And what you'll have instead is depositors putting funds with a money market fund, which is holding overnight RRPs with us.  There is structure.  As long as it happens smoothly-as long as it happens in a way that I don't think there rates are higher, and people who used to issue CP at 20 basis points are now issuing CP at 50 basis points or something.

MR. POTTER.  The FBOs could lose out, depending on if they're making arbitrage trades.

MR. ENGLISH.  Fair enough.

was getting IOER is not going to be VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  The person that getting IOER anymore.

MR. ENGLISH.  Fair enough.  That's right.

Thank you.  I appreciate that, because I can't say I have a great picture of this is.  And so if it's actually a rather trivial type of thing and really a scenario in which there could be some kind of dislocation of funding or maybe it's easy.  But you might think that for a new innovation magnitude you normally would have some type of reports or hearings-I MR. EVANS. exactly how simple or complicated there isn't something like that, then proposal of this sort of

April 29-30, 2014

hear from people who are affected, and you'd get some comments don't know the right term-to or something to help understand it better.

54 percent of the reserves are held by foreign banking reserves.  And they are holding them in a particular way.  I don't view that as a powerful interest group that would object to some of this, but it's possible that they MR. POTTER.  About organizations.  And large banking organizations outside of those hold the vast majority of the rest of the particularly could.

YELLEN.  Yes.  President Plosser. CHAIR

MR. EVANS.  Okay.  Thank you.

MR. PLOSSER.  I have a two-hander.

I think I have a similar question to what traders in some MR. PLOSSER.  I'd like to follow up, because President Evans was asking.  I had asked Simon, I think at the previous meeting, if where we saw a lot of the volume in these overnight markets, we were just replacing other of the volume.

MR. POTTER.  Just a little bit.

I'm worried about is, as President Evans suggested, as this very big program-if this is the way it goes-what are the potential unintended market structure, how the money markets are working, who the players are, coming from?  Are some people going to be exiting from funds of various kinds?  And will we just be replacing a MR. PLOSSER.  But what gets to be a consequences for and where the trades are going to be this business of supplying overnight market with what we do?

because I discussion of IOER and the funds rate we thought the IOER rate would I don't quite understand how this is going to work.  I'm a little bit nervous think going into the

April 29-30, 2014

turned out it didn't, and we now understand of unintended consequences on the market structure, are something I like I understand, and it makes me a little nervous. provide a pretty solid floor for the funds rate.  It better why.  And now we're talking about something that is much more complicated, and the ripple effects, in terms don't feel

MR. POTTER.  I'm not sure it's much more complicated.

Well, it seems to me it's much more complicated.  But that's just me. testing-and I'll talk about this later-has given us think we could have come out with a slightly MR. PLOSSER. MR. POTTER.  I would say that the more confidence that it is forming a floor.  It would have been nice to have done some testing with interest on excess reserves in advance.  I different version of that.  It is helping functioning in repo markets right now, and I will also talk about that later.

that we in the federal funds market, in which 90 percent of these trades are from the think option 1 and option would survive.  But I think if you chose option 1 or option that to happen.  It's harder to see in option 3-what there is we would basically use the margin of adjusting the overnight RRP rate to funds rate survived in the current form, in which this arbitrage activity part of the market.  And we feel that that would give us control over the federal funds it's a good way to get control over little bit strange to be using the foreign banking In terms of the unintended consequences, I think one of the consequences understand is FHLBs to the foreign banking organizations.  Under certain options-I 2-we're not sure whether that trade 2, you would be intending something like we've said make sure that the federal was a large rate.  That could have some strange consequences, because the federal funds rate, but it looks a organizations-effectively, their relationship with the FHLBs-to do that.

April 29-30, 2014

elastic supply of the safe asset is one we spent, really carefully, and we're still working There could be other unintended consequences.  I think we did a pretty good job of trying to think through some-the issue of the perfectly I think, the past six or seven weeks trying to understand on that.  And there might be other things we find, but the memo tried to cover that for you.

that we should be in my mind the risk of the unintended is.  So in option 3 or in and in which we're in some sense intentionally a smaller footprint in the nonbank financial sector, one would hope likely or would be smaller.  In option 1, in which potentially got a very, very large overnight RRP program, we can't think of something in unintended consequences is presumably larger. MR. ENGLISH.  If I could add just one thing-I think it's correct worried about unintended consequences, and at least consequences is larger, the larger the use of the overnight RRP program option 4, in which we're keeping a bigger spread, setting things up to have those unintended consequences would be less you've particular that would go wrong, but the risk of

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota.

Chair.  I have a question that I think was asking about in terms of the arbitrage, but I'm going to scenario in which the arbitrage doesn't work very effectively, and then I means for the effectiveness of monetary policy.  Suppose the interest rate macroeconomic objectives, the unemployment rate and inflation?  Should I be I've got the IOER rate at 200 basis points, but actually the unemployment rate is somewhat lower and inflation is going to be somewhat higher than what I would get of the FRB/US model if I just plugged in that 200 basis points?  I guess the point of my MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam follows on what President Lacker pose a hypothetical want to know what that on excess reserves is 200 basis points at the end of 2016, but the overall level of short-term rates is considerably lower-say, only 100 basis points.  How do we think that gap is going to be influencing our thinking that going to be out

April 29-30, 2014

that has lots of me about this all the time when I'm speaking-and we don't that.  Our objective is to fulfill our goals in terms of unemployment and inflation. our goals, then it's harder for me to them. question is, there are lots of spreads in the world.  Monetary policy is a blunt tool differential effects-savers remind worry about And if these spreads aren't material for our ability to achieve get worked up about

McAndrews has made, which was very useful for that it used to be the case that the fed funds rate was both the case.  Right banks is the IOER rate.  The cost of funding is the market rate.  And so the IOER rate different situation from the one we used to be in, and you have to think MR. MARTIN.  One point that Jamie me in thinking through this, is hurdle rate for banks to make loans and their cost of funding.  That's no longer the now, the hurdle rate for you might be worried about that spread because banks are going to be looking at when they're thinking about making loans, and their funding cost is going to be closer to market rates.  That is just a very through what the effect of that is.

will be the effect of that situation on unemployment MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  So what and inflation?

most efficient set of overnight rates there. in that world, because people will be trying So the effect you'll have in trying to explain what future policy will be like at 100 basis points is a significant gap in instruments that to each other, and that would suggest that we had messed up in 100 basis points for an overnight rate on something that, in MR. POTTER.  You are not going to have the It's going to be confusing to price term rates as well to understand, is that wedge going to stay at 100 basis points?  Is it going to move to 50?  Is it going to go to 25? will also be weak.  Overnight rates should be trading pretty close some pretty big way, I'd say.  That's

April 29-30, 2014

pretty close to a perfect substitute-that's a big wedge we put in the normal times, should be financial system.

Clearly, we haven't modeled this at all, but I would have thought one market rates-the commercial paper market, bond markets, coming off short-term market rates, which in would be as if monetary policy were just targeting a rate of 100 basis points. that Antoine made-banks may be feeling a little were facing a short-term funding cost of 100 basis points, because they IOER at 200 basis points.  So you have to worry a little bit more about what banks are bank lending behavior is relative to what's going on in markets, and try to somehow it means in terms of modeling for output, for inflation, and the things we care MR. ENGLISH. way to think about this is that Treasury markets, and so on-would basically be your example were around 100 basis points.  So those sorts of effects would operate more or less as usual.  It However, I think then-to bring in the point differently than if they can get doing, what map that into what about.

I'm confused.  I'm not following this.  How is it that not taking advantage of it? MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I guess the banks have access to this 100 basis point funding, and they have a 200 basis point investment opportunity and they're if you're a bank and now you're trying to comparing it with is the fact that you reserves and earn the 200 basis points.  And so your threshold for making a MR. MARTIN.  The way I think of it is that think, are you going to make this loan?  And what you're could just hold the loan is much higher.

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Sure.

we would be worried about banks not making as are so low. MR. MARTIN.  And that means that many loans as they would, given that funding rates

April 29-30, 2014

the IOER rate is a relevant rate.  So what MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  That sounds like makes the short-term rate the relevant rate?

Well, that's what you can fund at.  So you can attract deposits or MR. POTTER. wholesale funding.

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Who is 'you' in this?

balance sheet, attract at 100 basis points. MR. POTTER.  That's the bank.  It's trying to attract funds to expand its and it can would want to attract even more funds at MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  It would seem like it 100 basis points.

-to put it into the 200 basis points. MR. POTTER.

MR. ENGLISH.  But presumably there's some limit to that arbitrage because of the leverage ratio or whatever regulatory issues they face.

cost of funds isn't 100 basis points. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Then its

The argument you're making is-you were just trying to close the wedge If it doesn't close, there's either a cost or some the financial system.  And 100 basis points is still a really big overnight MR. POTTER. by saying the arbitrage had to close that wedge. other imperfection in wedge.

what I'm to say more clearly MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I'll let Governor Stein explain than I was planning to.

POTTER.  Yes. MR. STEIN.  I think in your example you've just strongly segmented the MR.

There are going to be some players, nonbanks, who are funding at are going to be banks for whom, given that they've used up their MR. STEIN. 100 basis points.  There

April 29-30, 2014

means that you can't minimum of microeconomic distortion.  There are many, ways we can get rates up and slow the economy if we need to.  There's no shortage of just that some of them will have less good microeconomic properties-I think we're microeconomic dimension, not the meeting-our-mandate dimension. leverage ratio constraint, they're funding at 200 basis points.  None of this achieve your macroeconomic objectives.  It's just about which way you achieve your macroeconomic objectives with the many those.  It's trying to optimize on the We have ample degrees of freedom to do that.

the losses that I'm suffering as a are many microeconomic distortions in the world, and I my unemployment and inflation.  I'm having a hard time seeing how that would be consequences for financial stability-those could be material. with Governor Stein's description of what I would see as the market, and the banks are in one segment and the nonbanks are MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I have to think about monetary policymaker.  I mean there want to be able to somehow quantify the losses associated with these gaps in terms of objectives for material.  We've talked about the I think I agree with you, but I agree market.  It's really a segmented in another.

What will tend to happen as the balance sheet gets smaller is that that effect, and people will have to think through, if the wedge is that to think through what we're going to do as that wedge changes.  That is quite to two years.  You're going to have become less segmented me a difficult situation for the transmission of policy in terms of MR. POTTER. friction will start to change the big, how is that going to affect where rates will be?  They'll have to understand two things.  We will have complicated, to transmit your policy intent over the next one to be thinking about who's hitting the leverage ratio as the market will over time.  It would seem to your intent.

April 29-30, 2014

In this discussion we're talking about macro and micro, and just to remind raising rates is that we think the economy is doing want to be adjusting that.  So if this wedge is a bank thinks about making good loans in an environment in to raise rates as much because MR. EVANS. at least myself, the context of why we'll be better.  Inflation might be a risk taking off.  We larger, and it's disrupting how which the economy is doing well, that's already something of a headwind.  Does that suggest that, depending on the size of the wedge, we might not need there's already something clogging things up?

Yes.  That was Governor Stein's point. MR. POTTER.

MR. EVANS.  Oh, is that what you said?  Oh, my gosh, I thought he said 'micro stuff.' [Laughter]

DUDLEY.  Or we could make regulatory changes to make the we have to just accept the wedge for what it is.  We could make the arbitrage more efficient. VICE CHAIRMAN wedge smaller, too.  It's not like change the regime to

finger.  [Laughter] MR. TARULLO.  One stability for a minute, because it was a very good discussion.  But as I think about the reverse repo facility, we have an and we have administered caps, whereas in the segregated balance accounts financial-stability side, the segregated balance accounts do have more flexibility presumably would be lowering rates as we get into this situation. MR. ROSENGREN.  I just wanted to go back to financial I thought administered rate, you have more market-determined rates and more market-determined caps.  If our concern gravitates on the because the banks

April 29-30, 2014

it seems like there's accounts.  But could you just perhaps describe the reverse repo facility and the segregated balance accounts, both from a other things we should be thinking about in attention so far in these memos. So if we were to go down the road of being really worried about this, a stronger argument for the segregated balance thinking about financial-stability standpoint and with regard to terms of the tradeoff between those two options?  We discussed the segregated balance accounts at some length at a previous meeting, but they got a little less reserve collateral accounts at that time, but we changed them.  You might just want to describe quickly what they are, Antoine. MR. POTTER.  They were called the name of

A segregated balance account is a specific kind of account that a bank and essentially any counterparty, pending a legal opinion by the the reserves that use them, and it protects the loan so there's no counterparty risk  And automatically the next day the loan is sent gets his funds back.  The intent of that construct is to eliminate does, as you suggested, create a competitive rate because banks are each other in order to offer these accounts, and we would expect that to lower the IOER rate. MR. MARTIN.  Right. can be created between Board's General Counsel.  This allows the investor to lend to that bank, and correspond to that loan are segregated in a way that the bank cannot investor's back so that the investor counterparty risk so as to create more competition.  That way current investors who are only looking to lend to FBOs and large domestic banks would be more willing to lend to a wide variety of banks.  And it competing with the wedge between market rates and completely thought through all of the financial-stability implications.  In would not be set administratively.  So I think to suggest that banks would want to lower the rates in times of crisis.  We might also We haven't many ways, at a high enough level, they look a lot like an overnight RRP construct, but we would not be direct counterparties, and the rate you're right

April 29-30, 2014

are possibilities, or it's desirable, to have other mitigants, like much you in a segregated balance account from one day to the next, or some want to think about whether there caps, to avoid surges.  But these would be private-sector arrangements, so banks and their investors would decide, maybe constrained by some limits we impose on them, how can increase your investment of these considerations.

President we were ability of people to move into an account.  Really, the cap becomes the amount of that institution's ability to find a counterparty. MR. ROSENGREN.  So we would avoid some of the problems that Kocherlakota was worried about in that earlier discussion, in that it would not look like limiting the excess reserves at any one institution and

We need to think more about this because we didn't get a chance memos to really investigate the segregated balance accounts.  It would be worth the concern that policymakers have to make these decisions.  If you institutions would do and whether there would be appropriate brakes on a run to SBAs in a are on a run to an overnight RRP facility, but presumably there are similar ways to and certainly it would eliminate a lot of the political-economy concerns policymakers having to make these decisions. MR. MARTIN.  Right. in this set of doing.  It would eliminate are worried about very rapid increases in take-up, you would want to think through what privatesector way that there address these issues, about

You had a footnote in the short-term policy memo that Were you asking for permission from the FOMC to develop this concept?  As I recall, you were saying it would take taking this tool

As I recall, the footnote said, 'if the FOMC instructs us to proceed.' MR. FISHER. MR. POTTER.  Yes.

MR. FISHER.  So are you asking for that, or not yet?

think anyone asked for it just yet.  That would depend on the table here.  If that's something they wanted to invest in, it would definitely be than late, because there's a lead time for that. MR. POTTER.  I don't everyone at good to know early rather

CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Last question-oh, President Kocherlakota.

the point you're making.  I think that the SBAs would offer some safety against some earlier.  At the same time, we might worry that the private in these instances might not fully internalize all the costs associated with having a run at might have contingent effects across the whole system in a way that may offers mitigants against some of the risks I was pointing to.

the staff memo on the target for the federal funds rate, I invite the staff, if they want, to at the same time offer more comments on the need standard deviation is about 40 percent higher than for the current effective federal funds rate. MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have a narrow question about some of the other interest rates that were suggested in but actually more generally to fix the federal funds rate.  You note the volatility of Eurodollar transactionsthe

April 29-30, 2014

in what I labeled as memo 5, 'The Target for the Federal Funds Rate directions.  Are those spikes that in Eurodollar markets equivalent to a shortage of certain runs of Treasuries in the Treasury GC market, or is it Eurodollar markets who don't in the federal funds market, or something else? And I am looking at chart 2 and Alternatives.'  I note the rather substantial spikes in both vary from the federal funds rate more a function of something technical that's something about the character of some of the participants in participate looking at you, Josh.  So have a go. MR. POTTER.  We're all

I think there is definitely a quarterly pattern, but volatility is sometimes more pronounced in Eurodollars than in fed There's definitely a calendar effect. MR. FROST.  Yes.  Thanks.  [Laughter] is your question why the funds and other times vice versa?

although this is a pretty big scale.  So I really exactly where these spikes were concentrated. MR. TARULLO.  Yes, there seems to be, couldn't tell last year-end the effect was really big.  I can't rememberwent negative, didn't they, or something weird?  Something like that, because the looked like.  So there's some effect from of the Eurodollars that might be part of this, but, overall, I think that in terms of the close over the period that we show.  They did definitely diverge MR. POTTER.  I think at the Eurodollars banks were trying to change what their balance sheets the holders effective rate, these are pretty more in 2007-2009 because of the funding issues of some of the foreign banks.

of MR. TARULLO.  That's what I wanted to ask, Simon-is that period of divergence particular relevance in thinking about incorporating this into our targeted rate?

The thing we don't know is whether the Desk would have operated in a MR. POTTER. different way if it had been targeting, say, a blended Eurodollar-fed funds rate, and that could

It seems unlikely because of the that Bill faced when he was the manager. have had some effect on some of these wedges that we saw. timing issue

trades that were difficult for ones that were early in the morning-which were causing the problem. issue of the operating regime we're in, at which times we would operate, and how we happening at the end of the day. MR. POTTER.  But it would have had more weight on the us to push against-the That's an could measure what was theme of specifying what it is that we six of you essentially of the view that even in think is an important part of what we do over the months? MR. TARULLO.  And to try to continue on the would need to address in the shorter term, are the the short-to-medium term-unless we were to, for example, go with option 1, which I don't we would-some addressing of the federal funds rate next few

MR. POTTER.  That's a pretty general question.

Well, no, it's not.  It's meant to be quite specific-which is to say, as of these options, we eventually hit in your view an important part of that plan that we do something about the current MR. TARULLO. we go forward with whatever plan, under some avatar of one on, is it federal funds rate, which seems to elicit a fair amount of concern because of the degree to which it has been narrowed?

are some tradeoffs.  Under some of the options you'd be market as it is today would stay in place.  However, you'd have anything goes wrong MR. POTTER.  I think there more confident that the fed funds more focus on the fed funds market.  That means that you'd have a risk if

April 29-30, 2014

for making it more robust against those rate is less of a focus, I think you'd still want $11 trillion in contracts, give the impression that we were indifferent to funds market was reacting, given that people have already entered those why you would want to 'robustify' it, and Bill, that we think is a reasonable thing to come out in using that as your policy rate.  So that would argue risks.  Under the options in which the federal funds to have some solutions in there, because it's a relevant rate-is it about OIS plus the futures?  And we wouldn't want to how the federal contracts.  So there would be two sets of reasons I think, is going to say this, but one of the things of this meeting is to think about robustifying among all of these options.

Yes, I was going to say that.  I think that, particularly for the options in we'd continue to target the funds rate, it would be sufficiently awkward later on to say, target that.  We have to target something else,' that I'd be inclined to make a than later to make the rate more robust. MR. ENGLISH. which 'Oops, we can't change sooner rather we're going to continue to target overnight bank funding rates, we're bank funding rate, which would be a mix of the fed funds that the Eurodollar transactions are three That gives you a fair amount of trades to use for calculating you would target.  As you can see in the chart that you pointed us to, aside from Look at the scale on the right-hand sidesomething, other than at quarter-end.  So really it's not changing things in we targeted before, but it Everything raises communications issues and is complicated, but I think it would not be that complicated to say that just going to use a broader overnight and Eurodollar rates.  We think from the broker data times what the fed funds trades are. the rate that quarter-end, these things track very closely together. this is 1 basis point or a big way.  We'd be targeting, in effect, something very similar to what would just be more robust as we normalize, and I find that pretty appealing.

MR. TARULLO.  Thank you.

We're not lawyers.

with. MR. FROST.  Yes, that's a good caveat to start

MR. FROST.  Right.  Just to clarify-

MR. POTTER.

MR. FISHER.  Not being a lawyer, let me ask you the question.

MR. FROST.  So I think we don't have any contractual obligation.  We, the Fed, have no contractual obligation.

MR. FISHER.  No, no, but they exist in the marketplace.

In terms of the market contracts, I think it really depends on the scope of is.  I think the conclusion similar in natureto the FR 2420, this new data collection we've started, are generally seen as MR. FROST. the change.  Generally speaking, the smaller the change, the safer it that the staff came to was that including transactions that were quite something like Eurodollars and the fed funds rate-or changing the source of the fed funds rate from brokered data being on the safer side of change.

partly because the contracts aren't well constructed.  The main the federal funds effective rate is the rates posted on the New York Fed website, and clear about where that comes from.  It's just put the ones printed, I think.  Governor Stein has been dealing with this issue on work that needs to be done to make reference rates more have a little bit of a margin in this world, because it wasn't that clear what the rate is. MR. POTTER.  This is source for then it appears in the H.15, and we are not very up there, and it says the reference rates.  There's a lot of robust.  We effective federal funds

-with our legal colleagues. MR. ENGLISH.

that we could continue to publish the old fed funds rate as Josh suggested.  I think we'd want to think hard about that choice: are, what are the policy issues are, and what we want to do.  But I think we Committee wanted to, target a broader overnight bank funding rate, and we could way or another how we would handle the existing outstanding contracts. One possibility, for example, is on the old basis.  It might become noisy for a while, but there would still be a rate that contracts could point to, and people could settle on that basis.  Alternatively, maybe we could get away with making this change what the legal issues could, if the sort out one

MR. FISHER.  Thank you.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Let's see.  I've got two-handers.  President Rosengren.

a quick follow-up to Governor Tarullo's question.  As long as Home Loan Banks, it seems like an odd market market as an would be contingent on coming up with a strategy in which there was a option 1 between option 2 and option 3, it's not clear to me how broad the There will be some trades, but if this light blue is still predominantly of anything other than seems like a very odd thing to target in monetary MR. ROSENGREN.  Just the fed funds is 90 percent driven by the Federal to be very focused on.  So it seems like if we're going to include the federal funds important component, it very different composition of who was trading in the federal funds market.  Clearly for and option 2-but when I get fed funds market becomes. coming from the Federal Home Loan Banks, the rate is not indicative Home Loan Bank borrowing demand.  And that policy.

FBOs' part.  It's the arbitrage by the FBOs. MR. POTTER.  It's the

Because FBOs can pick up funds anywhere to arbitrage into IOER, it funding rates.  It's not as if it has become idiosyncratic. These trades are curious and as Josh described, there are situations in which these trades might become much less included Eurodollar transactions and these fed funds transactions would look particularly peculiar. MR. ENGLISH. moves very closely with other short-term It has not.  It's still moving closely with other short-term funding rates. trades, frequent and the rate could become much more idiosyncratic.  But, for example, if you moved to a broader overnight bank funding rate that transactions, I don't think that mix of it, I agree, but if you were to just use the fed rate as what you were focused on, I'm worried it could be very idiosyncratic in a number I question whether we want to be highlighting an idiosyncratic rate until we're how it's going to move relative to other rates in the various regimes. MR. ROSENGREN.  So if you generalize funds of instances, and more confident about

reason to move to the more robust rate. MR. ENGLISH.  So that's the

MR. ROSENGREN.  Yes.

The interest on excess reserves rate is really what's driving this, and tight relationship to the other rates.  It's not because of the target we have the federal funds rate, obviously, because the Desk hasn't done any operations for 5½ years. MR. POTTER. that's why it's got a for

of the $11 trillion in contracts possible to say, or to hazard a guess-if we decide to maybe you shouldn't be tying your to the federal funds rate, even though we're going to continue to print it for a whileto run off and start being tied to something else?

But now we'd be saying that we're going to sector is going to react, and they're going to tie it would be a fine way to go, and it wouldn't happen immediately, but it MR. BULLARD.  I think it's focused on this rate, contracts phase this out.  And then, naturally, the private to a different rate.  That would happen over time.  Is that a reasonable way to think about it?  Otherwise, you've got to keep this market alive.

is well taken.  There would be renegotiations taking place, but I where the devil is in the details-how those renegotiations happen. MR. FROST.  Certainly new contracts would likely migrate to something else, but on the legacy contract issue, your point think that's a case in which the long-term framework is reasonably contracts to a rate that we then switch from would probably twice. MR. POTTER.  And this is important.  Making people migrate not look too good, if it made them switch

Okay.  Just one more follow-up on this:  We have examples of other rate.  So they must have also had this situation in there were existing contracts based on their previous target rate, and then they switched to MR. BULLARD. central banks that have switched their target which repo or something else.  That must have caused a lot of renegotiation in all these contracts.

The euro area is an example, in the LIBOR cases we look at.  There countries to one rate, and they would post the old rates if they were market rates.  You could definitely do that.  I do important than the Federal Reserve in their effect on MR.

learned some of the details about the construction of the effective federal funds rate.  No matter what we work to bring that up to speed with regard to transparency and the which I understand is purely voluntary.  We don't have MR. LACKER.  Just a small comment.  In the briefing documents, I institutional do, we need to do some relationship we have with the brokers, any agreement with them.

past year and a half, we've been trying to improve that so it will to an IOSCO-compliant rate.  We're not there yet.  We've made significant progress. from the FHLBs, as you saw in the fed funds memo.  But you're that we would definitely have to robustify.  The FR 2420, the start of the month, over the next year or so will provide us a rate. MR. POTTER.  Over the be closer We do have backup data correct.  That is one of the things which we started collecting at pretty good way of producing a more robust overnight

MR. LACKER.  Would you switch entirely to that?

still to be decided.  I think there's a lot of attractions in doing that MR. POTTER.  That's because of how the data is collected.

MR. LACKER.  So the other path you described that's taken a year, are there impediments you've had?

April 29-30, 2014

transactions, which is good.  But for some of the other governance aspects of how you get and check that what the brokers are sending us is the correct data, it's harder for us to put that framework in place. MR. POTTER.  Yes.  It's a voluntary submission by the brokers.  We don't regulate the brokers.  If you look through how you make a rate IOSCO compliant, it's definitely anchored in actual oversight in the process going to be

LACKER. to submit to an oversight they've the concerns we had at the time, particularly when this came up year in regard to LIBOR, is that they might want not to produce the data because of the legal MR.

it was very that you got it out in a timely way, so we actually had some to do is to summarize my own thinking after digesting all of this to be tentative, and I emphasize the word 'tentative' for two to go down this path, and, two, I don't think I have all of this figured out.  As the today made clear, there are a lot of complicated tradeoffs here, and deciding what all of things that I haven't thought of that you're going to point out my own thinking about where that balance should be struck. The staff has done a great deal of really high-quality work.  I thought balanced, and I really do appreciate time to digest this.  What I want material.  These remarks are going reasons.  One, I think we're going to learn a lot more as we continue with the testing program and as we start discussion earlier exactly where you strike the balance, I think, is very difficult.  So I also want to hear you say because I'm sure there are to me, and that are going to change important to start with what our key objectives are and then look at the potential Once you have the objectives well specified, then it's easier better or worse relative to achieving the objectives or how of those potential tradeoffs.  As I see it, I sense that I think there's one main are four subsidiary goals.  The staff, I think, had six goals overall.  I only combined two of theirs into one of mine. In thinking about the appropriate monetary policy framework over the next few years, I think it's tradeoffs between those objectives. to see how one formulation might be you could make adjustments to minimize the cost would frame the issue slightly differently than the staff in the goal and then there have five.  I

is the thing that I think we really want to stress as we go through expectations because the will work well might be important in the early stages to keep we do have control in The main goal-and this this discussion-has to be good control over money market rates, both in fact and in terms of market participants' expectations.  Now, I add that second piece about expectations that our proposal inflation expectations well anchored before we actually demonstrate that

April 29-30, 2014

rolling this out. fact.  So I think it's important that it's not only good control in fact, but also expectations of good control as we're the most important objective because it's how monetary policy can be used most efficiently to achieve our dualeconomy.  Greater control implies less volatility and risk, and that should be consistent with instruments of monetary policy and the monetary policy a desired set of financial conditions to achieve Now, control over money market rates has to be most directly relevant to mandate objectives.  So the focus should be on how we achieve the tightest linkage between our policy instruments onward to financial conditions and the ultimate outcomes that we seek in the real a more efficient system of financial intermediation.  Also, I think we have to be very careful not to lose sight of the fact that the framework itself are means to an end, generating our dual-mandate objectives, rather than the ends in themselves.

main goal of control, I think there are a number of other subsidiary that strike me as the most regime that's most consistent with financial stability.  I reliance on the overnight RRP facility is tricky.  Does it add to an elastic would provide safe assets in the time of crisis.  This would seem to be utilityto those who are seeking to increase their holdings of safe assets.  So that's the during times of crisis tend to tighten financial facility from less-safe short-term assets.  As we this could be ameliorated by cutting the target interest rate or adding liquidity by other Beyond this considerations, and I may not have thought of all of them, but the ones important are:  First of all, we want a think that, in this respect, financial stability, or does it diminish financial stability?  We already had a discussion on this, President Lacker and I and others.  On the one hand, it would seem useful to have facility that enhancing positive of the overnight reverse repo agreements in terms of financial stability.  On the other hand, though, availability of such an asset might conditions as money flowed into the RRP discussed,

Also, we could address how elastic the RRP on usage, which we also discussed think, is minimizing changes to market structure and there are transition costs to any new framework, and these costs are likely to be higher if the transition is deemed likely two transitions rather than one. terms of the issue of changes to market structure and practices is the reliance on and reliability of the federal that needs to be considered and evaluated. The second subsidiary concern, I practices.  The reason to put weight on this goal is that institutional to be temporary rather than permanent, because then there will be One important aspect in question of the federal funds rate as the FOMC's target.  If the FOMC placed a heavy the overnight RRP facility, this might further undermine the stability funds rate, and that's a potential cost

is minimizing the interest costs to the Fed to achieve a given set of conditions.  We didn't really discuss that up to this point.  For example, if the term term deposits.  That doesn't points per trillion.  A billion dollars a year is real money.  So I think we should put wouldn't want to go to the Congress and explain why we $1 billion in our decision. A third consideration financial deposit facilities and the term RRP facility drive up the Fed's interest expense compared with the expense under an overnight RRP facility, this argues for relying more on the overnight RRP facility.  Let's say the RRP facility is 10 basis points cheaper than sound like very much, but we have $3 trillion of reserves outstanding.  So it's $1 billion dollars per 10 basis at least some weight on that goal.  I didn't care about that occurs the core banking system.  I think there's a residual discomfort with encouraging a lot of much weight I want to put on this I do accept that, everything else equal, I probably prefer the money coming from the The fourth issue is minimizing the amount of disintermediation activity outside disintermediation flows.  I have to say I'm not really sure how goal, but

It's just hard to know why I feel that think the case for eliminating these flows money market funds is also enhanced if you expect to move back to a system with a these flows from money market funds would turn out to be than permanent.  Say we make the overnight RRP facility with a very narrow to me we would be generating a set of institutional changes were then going to ultimately undo in the longer term.  And so that might to how we think about this. banks to us rather way, exactly, and how high a cost I put on that.  I through the smaller balance sheet, so that temporary rather spread, so we got a lot of take-up, but then we knew we were going to go back to a much smaller balance sheet in the future-it seems for a few years that we be relevant all of these objectives, which often conflict?  On balance, my is to rely on the overnight RRP facility, subject to there being no big surprises from under money market rates, and then to take steps to lessen the negative overnight RRP facility.  I favor relying on the overnight RRP the best tool to maximize our control over money market rates at this facility puts a firm but not ironclad floor So how do I balance out initial bias our testing, to set a floor subsidiary cost from relying on the facility because I think that's the lowest cost.  So far the tests have shown that under money market rates, and that it saves money relative to the IOER because it's set at a lower level.

it's not obvious to what the benefit of us paying more is.  We're locking up reserves for longer periods of time any value to us.  To me, the only benefit from a term deposit that we get to show that there are fewer excess reserves in the banking system.  But mostly an accounting convention rather than substantive, because term deposits must be very close substitutes.  If they're not close substitutes, then we In contrast, for term deposits and term RP, we would pay up more, but me at higher rates-that doesn't have facility is this seems to me and overnight reserves

The other advantage, of facility is that the governance would lie clearly within the province may be a consideration for some. have to really pay up to generate them course, of the overnight RRP of the FOMC, and that associated with relying on the overnight RRP facility?  I think of ways.  First, if one's worried about the potential degree of can be offered at a at the level that best trades off control against RRP and mainly between the overnight RRP and the IOER rate, and I think this has the advantage of being consistent with how we've market rates trading generally between 0 and would reduce the communications difficulties associated with liftoff.  If were set equal to the IOER rate, then the federal funds rate would likely above the IOER rate.  I think it would be hard to communicate that shift. So what about the costs these can be addressed in a number disintermediation out of the banking system, then the overnight RRP rate spread below the IOER rate, with the spread set the amount of desired disintermediation.  Also, with a spread between the overnight IOER rates, existing money market rates would tend to trade rate been conducting policy to date-with the money 25 basis points-so this the overnight RRP rate trade

what the right don't think we know what the right spread is today.  This is something that we could gaining more experience with this tool.  Presumably it would be somewhat narrower current spread of 20 basis points, because the current spread results in a very low takethe high point for 8 percent of the total reserves somewhat narrower spread than that.  But the large So what would the spread be?  There was a lot of discussion earlier about spread is.  I decide after than the up of the overnight RRP-at only about the $180 billion mark that you cited as non-quarter-end and non-year-end periods.  That's about 7 or outstanding.  So you would probably want it at a current spread could work just fine if we want to place more weight on not having a

April 29-30, 2014

It's really a question of whether we think we would have adequate control at a 20 basis point spread between the RRP rate and the spread most consistent with that set of objectives, don't really know the answer we find the rates that generate those outcomes, rather than that not knowing what outcomes that spread would actually My view is that we shouldn't decide today what the spread should be.  We should be deciding what kind of outcome we want in terms of the amount of disintermediation and the amount of control, and then we should set because we a priori .  I would prefer that the discussion be about what outcomes we want, and then we discuss today what spread we want, generate.

financial-stability risk of an overnight RRP facility, I made it very clear that one could address this by imposing a cap.  The cap binding during normal periods but would limit the volume of inflows during periods market turbulence and stress.  I think this cap could be an aggregate cap or it could be per toward the limit on the counterparty because I think it much I want and this is how much I get.'  It also allows the counterparties to plan. much capacity they would get in a crisis situation.  But I don't feel Second, if one's worried about the think the staff has wouldn't be of counterparty.

made it pretty clear that the federal funds rate right now is rest mainly on the activity of the Federal Home Loan Banks.  So my own view is that it problem independent of the decisions we make than hold the monetary policy framework decision trying to keep the sickly federal funds rate market alive.  So my preference would be to Eurodollar transactions. could do this by relying on the broker data-there are broker data for both overnight and the federal funds rate-if we needed to do this quickly, and then over we defined it would be very close to the current federal funds rate-within basis point over the past few years-and I think that the risk of contract frustration in in terms of what rates people would actually be receiving and paying. Now, I think the staff has pretty fragile.  The federal funds market is not very big, and it's not very deep.  The calculated rates would be better to address the federal funds rate on the monetary policy framework, rather hostage assess whether we could fix the federal funds rate by redefining the federal funds rate as representing banks' overnight wholesale borrowing, including overnight Initially we Eurodollar transactions the longer run we could use the FR 2420 data to do this.  My understanding is that if the federal funds rate as this rate, less than 1 this case would be de minimis .  The rate would almost be the same rate.  The changes that have happened to the federal funds market over the past few years would be far greater than what this change would represent target rate in the new regime, I think you could either to an overnight RRP-IOER corridor or you could continue to target the new, improved I would in this formulation.  Then the With respect to what should be the switch federal funds rate.  Targeting the old, sickly federal funds rate is not something that suggest is appropriate.  As long as the federal funds rate does not behave idiosyncratically and erratically, I think it would be okay to target the federal funds rate

April 29-30, 2014

to manage the federal funds rate objective.  But if the turned out to be idiosyncratic-jumping around, into and out of the rangethink you'd want to reexamine that conclusion because you don't really want to be moving around to capture wherever the federal funds rate is is moving independent of other money market rates. overnight RRP facility would just be a tool federal funds rate then I the overnight RRP rate and the IOER rate moving if the funds rate the decisions we make about our monetary policy out.  The fact is we're going to have monetary policy with a very large balance sheet for quite a while.  So my view is, for that period, learn by doing, and have that drive the be made until much room. For the longer term, I don't see framework over the next six months as ruling anything in or to conduct why not pick the most effective regime ultimate decision about the long-term framework-a decision that won't later and probably by very few, if any, of the people in this

I do see the attractions of a floor system for the longer term because it's less short-term interest rate volatility.  And a floor may, by supplying more safe liabilities to the financial system, add grease to the payment I'm completely happy to defer discussion about where we're term to future Committees.  I am confident that if we did use the relatively easy to move reserves.  As the balance sheet normalized, the gradually move back to a corridor regime. I admit that easier to implement.  There's no need to add or drain reserves each day.  Shifts in money demand show up in quantities, not price, so there's system system and enhance liquidity.  But going to go in the longer overnight RRP-IOER rate corridor for several years, it would still be back to an old corridor-style system with limited overnight-RRP-to-IOER spread could be allowed to widen, where the cap on RRP usage could be lowered, and as you did that you could just the federal funds rate?  I'm agnostic Summing up, how does this translate into the seven questions posed by the staff?  The first question was, should the Committee continue to target

April 29-30, 2014

rate should be targeted or not as long as the funds rate is stable and not idiosyncratic, I don't want to target the federal funds rate.  I think the it's robust to whatever monetary policy. about whether the funds idiosyncratic.  If it's important decision is that we need to fix the federal funds rate so that decisions we make with respect to prefer to fix the federal funds rate.  That's what I'm for. So the second question is, if we shifted away from the federal funds rate, what would I prefer?  Well, I strongly

do I think about relying on the overnight RRP facility?  Well, as I made an spread is depends on how much take-up we want for the Third, what pretty clear, I think the overnight RRP and the IOER rates in tandem, with a spread, is attractive option, and how wide that overnight RRP facility.

much divergence do we think would be acceptable between and the IOER rate, and how much volatility would be acceptable?  I don't think the divergence was 20 basis points but it was really stable at 20 basis points, I would how much you're if you're moving around a lot, then you're probably losing control over is contained within a range, that's certainly control in my opinion.  I don't think you need much greater control than, say, 10 basis monetary policy has been conducted for a long time.  We increments.  It's sort of hard to argue why you need The fourth question was, how the targeted rate the issue is so much about divergence.  I think it's really about control and volatility.  So if you told me that find that completely acceptable.  I think it's really more of a question of moving around, because financial market conditions.  As long as volatility adequate points because, you know, look at how move the federal funds rate in 25 basis point greater control than 10 basis points.  You change the monetary policy setting in much greater increments.

April 29-30, 2014

net interest expense, I think it's a definite negative.  I think if year, I want to know what I'm The question on higher you're going to spend more, you've got to justify what you're getting in exchange for that additional expense.  So if we're spending $1 billion more per getting for that.

testing that's been done to date, what should we I would eliminate options 1 and 5, probably 4 as well.  Right now, I sort of land low risk that market participants will misconstrue this as foreshadowing The sixth question was, given the eliminate? between 2 and 3.  That said, I do support further testing.  While we're still buying assets, I think we can test with very liftoff.

interest rate targets.  It reminds us that in the managing 'the general level of interest rates,' and that no in stone as the only appropriate target instrument.  It also shows in the 1980s, it just evolved as the conduct of policy evolved.  Nonetheless, the I particularly like memo 4, on alternative past the FOMC implemented policy by particular interest rate is etched how the process by which we came to adopt the effective federal funds rate was an evolutionary one.  Sometime

April 29-30, 2014

that led to a inflation. FOMC over that period managed successfully to set monetary policy on a course long period of low and stable the Committee might target, subject to its own shocks.  But, nevertheless, it is striking how closely various overnight interest rates track each other over time.  The memo also notes that and I think this is important to keep in view as we discuss these level of overnight interest rates on any given day.  And because of this, in the past we the federal funds rate target persistent and rate could be volatile, to a great The memo lays out a number of overnight interest rates recognizing that each is the monetary policy arguably works best not through overnight rates directly, but through their effect on medium-term interest rates, issues.  So the expected path of overnight rates over an intermediate horizon is more important than the have conducted policy in a way that has tried to make changes persistent and predictable, even though the effective degree, from one day to another.

as background, my working hypothesis is that day-to-day variation in the is of secondary importance for the conduct of with our experience prior to the crisis, when the spread 19 basis points 10 percent of the 15 basis points 10 percent of the time.  And that did not appear to cause monetary policy.  I don't recall it being remarked upon time or the Committee considering any steps to try to address that issue.  More broadly, market interest rates would fall in line.  That confidence So with this spreads between various overnight interest rates monetary policy.  This is consistent between the effective federal funds rate and the overnight repo rate was quite volatile.  For example, from 1991 to 2006, the spread was below negative time and above positive any problems for the implementation of at the when we raised the federal funds rate target under our previous operating regime, we were very confident that a wide array of short-term

market rates in our current regime?  My sense now is that we ideally positioned to carry out this arbitrage.  They have unencumbered, high-quality assets.  They can use these as collateral to market and leave the proceeds on deposit with their friendly local Reserve insurance premium and the shadow cost associated with the leverage ratio.  But these are relatively well defined.  They don't seem likely to vary with the level of interest rates, those spreads are going to widen as we raise interest rates.  I likely to be what pins down the general between market rates and the interest rate on excess reserves. So the question is, can we have confidence that arbitrage will similarly limit variation in spreads between overnight money can.  Many large domestic banks are substantial portfolios of borrow in the RP Bank.  For sure, there are incremental costs associated with this arbitrage-for example, the FDIC finite and and so it doesn't strike me as likely think they are likely to remain stable, and I think they are relationship

District indicate that, for the interest rate on excess 15 basis points.  So at a repo rate of less than 10 basis points, this large profitable to borrow in the RP market in order to earn the interest rate on turns out they used to do this trade in large amounts, but they don't anymore, of supervisory pressure.  Over the past several years, the System has been market and lend, sometimes at term, in the form of reverse RPs to enable rightly discourage them.  But this Conversations my examiner staff had with a large bank in our them, there is a breakeven spread between the overnight RP rate and reserves, and it's about bank would find it very excess reserves.  It and they don't because discouraging banks from engaging in so-called matched-book repo trades in which they borrow in the overnight RP their private-sector clients to fund asset positions.  These operations involve counterparty risk and maturity transformation, and, thus, our supervisors

April 29-30, 2014

market and the interest rate on excess reserves. discouragement seems to have been taken by examiners in the field and by the banks themselves as applying more broadly to arbitraging the RP

this makes any sense at all, because counterparty risk on Federal is, arguably, negligible.  And if the bank lost access to RP funding, then end of it-there wouldn't be any I wasn't privy to.  But as part of our learning process this inadvertently as consistent with a spread in the neighborhood of 15 basis points, and that a suitable mechanism to rely on. Now, it's not clear that Reserve Bank deposits its Fed deposit would simply roll off, and that would be the other damage.  I'm not aware of any serious discussion about this at the System level.  There could have been some discussions summer, I think we should be talking about this, because we might have discouraged some arbitrage that would make economic sense and would help us implement monetary policy more effectively.  In any event, absent this supervisory consideration, it looks if the fundamentals are is something I think we surely could live with.  As Vice Chairman Dudley pointed out, it's large spread, historically speaking.  But if it doesn't vary much, I think that that would be a perfectly going to need an overnight reverse RP facility on a I just don't think we are would then set lending for most banks.  We have complete control over it, Because of this, I don't think we are routine basis to keep the RP rate moving in line with the IOER rate. going to need it.  So my preferred policy option, as we begin to tighten, would be to rely on the IOER rate.  We would accompany this by providing a relatively wide target range for interbank rates chosen by the FOMC with the tacit agreement that the Board of Governors the IOER rate at the upper limit of that range.  The IOER rate is the most important determinant of the opportunity cost of short-term and I think the policy changes would be easy to communicate in such a framework.

April 29-30, 2014

this seemingly perverse supervisory movements even if there is substantial day-to-day volatility.  For influencing the mediumI don't think that day-to-day volatility is going to cause a effective.  I would just point out that we already depend very heavily on the the forces of arbitrage to keep interest rates on one-month Treasury bills, for is a part of how we do business around here and have for a long tried to probe the staff, I haven't seen any concrete reason to believe there is an impediment to that arbitrage.  Sure, we know about some balance sheet costs that the wedge between Treasury rates and municipals that people the tax clientele effects.  As President Kocherlakota points out, the financial system effectiveness. I would expect the overnight RP rate to generally trade between 15 and 25 basis points below the IOER rate, depending on how we correct guidance.  Movements in short-term interest rates more broadly should closely track in the IOER rate, term rates that are important to us, problem.  Now, this relies heavily on the expectation that arbitrage of the type I described is going to be presumption of example, in line with expected overnight rates, to keep interest rates on two-month Treasury bills in line with expected one-month rates, and so on.  So this isn't some daring foray into mysterious science.  This is something that time.  And as I've going to be will imply a wedge similar to understand, is rife with such spreads, but I don't think they are going to impede our future that while we all believe arbitrage is important and is likely to low, there may be some worrywarts out there with less than 100 percent to be caught flatfooted, if spreads do to the discount window on the opposite side of the rate.  When we first raise rates, we Now, I can understand keep spreads stable and perfect confidence in this notion.  And so we don't want end up, for some reason we don't foresee, widening more than we are comfortable with.  One easy way to mitigate that risk would be to maintain the overnight reverse RP facility for a time as a deep backstop-say, 75 to 100 basis points below the IOER rate.  This would make it analogous

April 29-30, 2014

IOER rate, and we won't market at all.  And then we just let that RP facility sit there it is, and trail.  If that doesn't happen-we should know in a the RP rate or not.  And then we can bring this facility into action as an tool to manage short-term interest rates.  But otherwise, it would be held in reserve as could keep the overnight RRP rate where it is now and just see what happens.  There is a really good chance, I think, market rates are going to rise in tandem with the need to intervene actively in the RP 75 basis points behind, or whatever meeting or two, right?  It should take a meeting or two to figure this out, and we'll know whether we have to raise additional a cheap insurance policy in case of unforeseen developments.

here is that we are going to find out pretty quickly whether we need this operating procedures.  We don't need to pick IOER rate right now, or before we make our first move.  We can move in the IOER rate and see how it plays out.  And if that spread is going to stay under could adjust accordingly.  Let me emphasize one more thing.  If the RP rates the RP rate is in the RP rate became IOER rate, then it's not So the point facility or not.  And we don't need to make a decision now to commit to a permanent, once-andfor-all or for-the-indefinite-period change in our the overnight RRP spread to the make a 25 or 30 basis points, we should know in a couple of weeks, but certainly after a meeting or two, and then we become divorced from the IOER rate, the question is whether the IOER rate or the cul-de-sac.  So we wouldn't need to intervene immediately.  If disconnected from the IOER rate and if other market rates rose with the clear we should worry about it.  That's worth keeping in mind.

Regarding the specific questions posed by the staff, for the first two, I'd support developing a more robustly defined interbank rate along the lines that Vice Chairman Dudley outlined.

April 29-30, 2014

the don't see a heavy reliance on it.  When we raise the interest rate on excess think we should keep rates where they are now and see how it goes. Regarding question 3, about full allotment, given the IOER rate, I see no need to use overnight RRP facility on a routine basis.  I just don't think we are going to need it.  I reason now to commit to reserves, I

So I don't think we For the overnight reverse repurchase facility, what we really want to know is how the RP-IOER spread behaves in the absence of an active RP facility.  That's what we really want to learn.  I think we've learned enough about how this facility works.  What we want to do is find out what happens if we raise

I would keep the per-counterparty limit on rates for now. need to do any more testing with the caps unchanged and retain the further field research to pursue, and that has to do with whether large banks that have significant portfolios of unencumbered collateral are positioned to relevant to matched-book repo trade and the like.  That's the There is some obvious other arbitrage RP rates and the IOER rate; what they view as the plausible, breakeven rate at which they would be interested and at which it would be profitable to do that; and whether they feel dissuaded by supervisory guidance kind of further research I'd like to see.

Chair.  As you may remember, I was raised by Robert '70s, in the evolution of the operating system from and the continuum on to Potter.  So I'm not going to answer the 11 questions very much the memos, but I think the way we illuminated it now with the all-at least I'm-much better informed.  I appreciate very much the tutorial MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Madam Roosa, and so I'm steeped, from back in the Roosa to Volcker or 7 questions or whatever they may be.  But I want to basically state some principles because I found today's discussion immensely illuminating.  This was a bit of a document dump to me, and I appreciate discussion, we're that you have provided us.

anything at this juncture, although I must say, options 1 and 5 this point, and options 2 and think we need to have some basic principles, and I want to list I think we should be mindful of here.  The first is that the FOMC's monetary policy diluted.  I think the FOMC's decision should be the main policy I'm not going to rule out seem the least appealing to me, but I'm not going to signal that at 3′ are seemingly preferable.  But I five that influence should not be influence on the level of short-term rates.  The operating system should give us-that is, the

April 29-30, 2014

over the overnight money market rate.  The Desk should follow our instructions.  At the same time, I must say that I'm a little to find the right balance.  That's just a personal insecurity on my part. FOMC-the tightest possible practicable control New York uncomfortable in trying to micromanage the New York Desk, and I'm not sure how easy it is going to be

I think that whatever operating system we choose-and I mentioned consistent with the eventual normalization of policy implementation, and SOMA balance sheet.  By the way, I don't think we're sheet.  As Mr. Lacker said, I wasn't in favor of one this think the dynamics have changed in the marketplace and we're not going to go back it is germane that we are focusing on the operating system. The second is that this before-has to be with the size and composition of the going to go back to a small balance large, but I to the $900 billion balance sheet.  We're going to have a substantially larger balance sheet, and, therefore, that we need to be sure that the operating system does not heighten was discussed.  Again, as I said about one-fourth of the make sure we don't marketplace. A broader principle is financial-stability concerns.  The idea of caps on the ON RRP earlier, I think we have to constantly be mindful of the fact that we're short-term funding market.  We have to keep that in mind, and we have to exacerbate any financial instability instincts of the

that are probably obvious to everybody else, but that benefit the few-the FBOs, for example.  It always has to be the people and to keep in to my last point of principle:  However we handle this, we need to manage the is why it's important that we vet this fully during the summer-by the And then two very broad principles I feel very strongly about.  Narayana, in a way, raised this; I'm going to rephrase it.  The operating system should not handmaiden to this Committee's obligation to work for the benefit of the mind our dual objectives.  That may be an obvious point, but I think we have to always bear it in mind, which leads political risk here.  This

April 29-30, 2014

just at this table, so that we all fully that risk again.  I don't think it's completely settled out of the there is political risk here just because we're changing and we're evolving.  And there's way, I would be in favor of additional discussions, not understand where we're going.  Whenever you go through a transition, you raise questions, and it wasn't very long ago that we were in the Klieg lights and our independence was seriously threatened.  I don't want to raise system, and while no one has mentioned this yet, I think we need to be deeply mindful of the fact that nothing wrong with evolving.

today's discussion, there were a lot of questions I had that I think needed to be filled in.  I sessions and tutorials on this subject going to This is a serious matter.  Those are my basic So I would like us to have further discussion on the subject.  Again, coming from a markets background, I'm good at being stale.  I did find these memos interesting reading, but until don't think it would hurt us at all to have some intermediate matter.  We have to be absolutely confident in what we're going to do because we're put you on a stage in September, and I'm serious. principles, and again, I'm leaning toward variations of options 2 or 3, but right now I think we ought to keep as much on the table as we possibly can.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

more, but thank you very much for that. MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Thank you very much to the staff for all the memos that you provided.  It certainly has been thought-provoking, and I think this morning's discussion as well as the memos have probably answered some of our questions and then raised a few and then I'll answer the questions.  The first principle, I think, is very similar to theirs. which we are highly confident we'll be able to raise short-term Like Vice Chairman Dudley and President Fisher, I'm starting with some guiding principles We should choose an option in

April 29-30, 2014

we view that as appropriate.  The reputational risk to the Federal Reserve from not have the desired relationship with short-term rates strategies. rates when adopting a new instrument that does would greatly complicate exit we should remain focused on achieving the appropriate policy in large part with an eye toward how effectively they influence the broader financial care most about. The second one that President Kocherlakota kind of alluded to, which I don't think was as emphasized in the memos, is that macroeconomic outcomes.  When we choose to tighten policy, we should choose our instruments conditions we

that we will still be learning by doing, because we have never balance sheet.  This would argue for a cautious approach when we the size of the take-up of the reverse repo facility, the Third, we should realize before had such a large initiate the first tightening, recognizing that volatility of that take-up, and the market reaction to our action are all quite uncertain.  I was ready to cross that out if I had gotten a different answer to my question, but it stayed in.

we learn more evolved significantly as our strategies evolved.  Hence, an important part of the exit economic situations also as we learn from implementing the new policies. The fourth one is that we should remain open to changing our tactics as about operating with a large balance sheet as the balance sheet evolves.  Our previous exit principles strategy should be an acknowledgment that it may change, not only as change, but composition of the balance sheet as important tools for macroeconomic outcomes.  We should maintain the flexibility to continue Fifth, we have used the size and generating appropriate to use these tools.

to the Committee-first question, during market.  As long as we have a sizable balance the federal funds market is likely to be somewhat idiosyncratic, and the behavior of the the size of the reverse repo facility, which will be In terms of the questions that were addressed the period of normalization, I would focus on how effectively our policies raise short-term rates generally rather than focus on the federal funds sheet, federal funds market will likely be sensitive to quite uncertain with an open allotment.

Because these are new tools, uncertainty about how market rates will respond to our setting of these market rates respond, we should For question two, I would initially focus our discussion on the interest rates we control, the interest rate on excess reserves and the reverse repo rate. there's a high degree of administered rates.  Once we have some experience with how revisit this issue.

repo facility in the long run.  We may find it to be an effective and experience is through the normalization. On the third question, we should have an open mind about how we utilize the fixed-rate, open-allotment, reverse important permanent tool depending on what our would initially begin with a very large spread between the and the interest rate on excess reserves, similar to the spreads we currently see excess reserves.  As we develop a better and volatility of the take-up is affected by the spread, we may the program.  As we gain related to risk-on periods and the term structure of able to determine the appropriate spread. And for question four, I reverse repo rate between short-term rates and the interest rate on understanding of how the size want to narrow the spread over time.  I would want to keep the spread large enough to minimize the likelihood of hitting the caps we are likely to need when we set experience with how the size of the take-up is interest rates, we'll be

April 29-30, 2014

in terms of the Federal Reserve should remain secondary to concerns about our ability to that are linked to households' and firms' economic decisions and, ability to achieve our fundamental macroeconomic objectives. Regarding question five, our focus should remain solidly on achieving appropriate macroeconomic outcomes.  Concerns about the financial costs of the various options the interest cost for influence key short-term rates thus, to our

I have an open mind, my preferred options would not be options 1, 4, or 5 currently prefer an option somewhat between options 2 and 3, preference as we learn more through the next year.  As I a moment ago, I would keep an open mind as to the appropriate operating procedure in the have a better understanding of the Sixth, while during the normalization period.  I though I could obviously change that said long run and wait to make any long-term decisions until we normalization process.

question seven, while it is essential that we do some testing of the reverse to better understand its effects on short-term interest rates, I would wait to do largethe taper.  My concern is that such a large-scale understanding of how the facility works.  After that, we might want the example, we could move the interest on excess basis points, leaving the reverse repo rate at 10 basis points, to obtain a better the reverse off pretty tentative, get a better understanding of some of Finally, for repo facility scale testing of the facility until we have finished testing could be interpreted by market participants as signaling a tightening before we intend to do so.  I suggest that at the end of the taper, we gradually raise the reverse repo rate above the current level of the federal funds rate, but still below the IOER rate, possibly up to 10 basis points, to obtain a better first restrictive rate increase to be small.  For reserves to 35 understanding of the relationship between the interest rate on excess reserves and repurchase facility.  So I would start

April 29-30, 2014

that we still have, and once we learn from doing that, then I would proceed the uncertainties depending on what we learned from that exercise.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

So Simon, you're going to have to take careful notes. MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair. seemed that winter finally arrived on [Laughter]  Still, I, too, actually going to give a questions to target the understanding of the issues before committing to a longer-run operating framework. already heard this said many times.  But that implies that we should not take any I have two bottom-line takeaways.  The first is that we should continue federal funds rate, appropriately modified to include the broader set of transactions in the overnight interbank lending market during normalization.  And the second is that we need a much better I think I've near-term action that forecloses options in the future.  I'm going to elaborate on each point.

funds rate as our headline policy instrument, we it is familiar, and before we can consider safely First, by continuing to use the federal will greatly facilitate policy communication during the normalization period.  The federal funds rate may not be perfect and isn't perfect, but shifting to a new instrument, we need further experimentation and a greater understanding of the consequences, both intended and unintended.

testing alternative tools, there are still many important unresolved issues.  The In particular, the discussion today has made it clear that although we've made substantial progress in overnight reverse repo facility has worked fairly well at putting a floor under short-term money market rates, and I support further testing, particularly with an eye toward learning how the

April 29-30, 2014

is some the fed funds rate will decouple from other short-term interest rates, potentially in a risk to our communications strategy.  More experience with testing that tool can help risk.  While I'm in favor of additional reverse repo tests, with the goal of using this think the IOER rate and the overnight reverse repo facility plenty of control over short rates for implementing monetary policy.  The term tool short. reverse repo facility affects the functioning of the interbank lending market.  There worry that nonlinear fashion as the reverse repo rate rises toward the IOER rate.  That would pose a potential clarify this tool actively during the transition period, I'm inclined to put the Term Deposit Facility and term reverse repos on the back burner.  I will give us should only be needed as a backup to be called upon if our other tools fall next couple of years, I'm confident that we will quickly learn to improve rates in the context of a large balance sheet and to calibrate our procedures appropriately. Looking ahead over the fine-tune our approach once it's implemented.  The control of interest rates will rapidly as we gain experience with adjusting interest learn

Over time, as our understanding of target range for the federal funds rate or move target rate.

All short-term interest rates have My second point is today.  The

Importantly, as I said at the start, because we'll be the adoption of option 1 and perhaps option 2 because they market.  Thank you. moved together very closely, especially if you look at them on a monthly-average basis, which is enough for effective policy control.  It's possible some point in the fairly distant future, but sizable.  Again, we'll be able to gather some useful information on these issues during the transition period over learning over time, we should not take any near-term action that closes off our options in the future.  To my mind, this rules out could irrevocably damage the federal funds

CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lockhart.

Chair.  Like everyone else, my thanks to the memos that were very helpful.  I thought you framed the well as a starting point in a process of refining the Committee's approach, laid out the tradeoffs, and pointed out the need for further testing, all of which I agree MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam staff for a very impressive spectrum of discussion considerations and the with.

raised.  Rather, I would like to share how I'm framing my key tradeoffs.  In effect, what I'll present are my priors Due to the preliminary nature of today's discussion, I am not going to present hard-andfast conclusions on the questions thinking and how I'm leaning on the ahead of the Q&amp;A discussion that just took place.

memos, I am organizing my thinking by applying tests to the five policy implementation approaches.  The tests are control of overnight and me flesh these out a little bit. In reaction to the material in the staff three short-term interest rates, communication ease and effectiveness, and serviceability of the approach over time.  Let

With that I can envision explaining without excessive to both financial can probably preserve needed within a scheme that varies the emphasis on tools, as change, including the scale of the balance sheet.  In that important to communicate at the outset that we're not changing the approach continues the focus on the a broad array of market rates through direct I think it's possible that the federal funds market might become funds rate at the outset, for reasons that are well memo, but to try to preserve its functioning with the idea of returning it to a later on.  However, I don't envision us holding to the centrality of the fed funds target in the early stages of normalization. I favor approaches that seem to convey a high certainty of control over the policy rate and establish a relatively hard floor, especially in principle regard to communication, I favor approaches contortions, both as an approach and in the particulars of Committee decisions, practitioners and the general public.  With regard to serviceability over time, the chosen approach should be durable to the extent possible.  I think we tactical flexibility or optionality contingencies dictate or conditions respect, I think it's theoretical framework of policy implementation and that our usual transmission mechanism of influence over influence on short-term rates. more viable as a monetary control mechanism as the balance sheet shrinks.  It might make sense, in my thinking, to de-emphasize the federal described in the staff more central role rate regarding the options, I lean toward options 1, 2, and advisable to establish a hard floor through emphasis on and the overnight reverse repo rate.  I think there IOER and reverse repo rates equal, assets, but I don't dismiss the concerns about financial stability. Now, to get a little bit more specific 3, versus options 4 and 5.  I think it's administered-rate setting through the IOER rate is something to be said for the simplicity of option 1 with the as they are basically equivalent

I decide The balance sheet may stay quite large for quite some time, so I'm skeptical about the effectiveness of the term draining tools as a way to exert control.  As I read them, with their reliance on draining operations, options 4 and 5 may present challenges.

market that provides a daily market signal of demand seems to me to be worth preserving.  In that sense, option 3 is attractive.  The market is a still-open and pivotal question, in my view.  What are the funds market in the beginning, by the Home Loan Banks?  Would a policy change by the Loan Banks throw a wrench into option 3?  Is the control risk associated with trying to role worth accepting?  I would appreciate more Longer term, a viable federal funds for reserves viability of the funds control risks inherent in running a policy with emphasis on a small federal dominated, at least Home maintain the fed funds rate as having a central staff work and discussion on these subjects.

to set out distinct options for the sake of but combinations that involve mixes and matches are feasible.  It is not clear to me be in the mix while implementing something 1, 2, or 3.  So I do not object to further testing of the Term Deposit Facility.  Overall, more It does seem to me that the staff has tried discussion, that some use of the term draining tools could not like options in response to the exercises presented, I settle mostly on option 2, maybe option 3, with confidence that the fed funds rate won't behave idiosyncratically.

be about how the exit strategy is related to the tactical issues discussed to walk through the questions posed and give my on those questions. MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I'm going to divide my comments into two parts.  The first part will in the staff memos, and the second part will be perspective start with relation to the exit strategy.  As many of you know, I have advocated in the one that is outlined in the Committee's statement of exit means last in, first out.  I suggested that the Committee's more controversial zero lower bound was encountered in December of 2008.  In carefully controlled pace, the present time.  Even before the reversal of the Operation Twist So let's the past a different exit strategy than principles.  In particular, I have suggested that a LIFO exit strategy may be preferable for the Committee.  LIFO and experimental policies could be reversed first, as they were attempts by the Committee to provide accommodation after the particular, the balance sheet should first be allowed to shrink, but at a and the pace of balance sheet reduction would become, for a time, the primary tool of the Committee, just as the pace of balance sheet expansion is at revising the size of the balance sheet, LIFO would call for program put in place by the Committee in 2011.

the Committee could take action to policy rate could stay much lower much longer.  At some point in the distant future, under a LIFO approach, the balance sheet and further removal of accommodation would have to come the balance sheet back to a normal size, the to resume targeting the federal funds rate, if it so desired, or it rate, such as the repo rate.  But the The LIFO policy would have the great advantage that remove accommodation without raising the policy rate.  The for would approach a more normal size from increases in the policy rate.  However, with Committee would then be able could turn to targeting another short-term interest

April 29-30, 2014

to maintain the large balance sheet and still influence the federal funds complications of trying rate would be eliminated.

talking about today, is what are we doing with is it being reduced?  If it's being reduced, isn't that tightening policy?  If it's easing policy?  I think there are with some of what we're thinking about here in trying to deal with the rate issue separately from the balance sheet question.  The Committee may wish to memos balance sheet.  In general, the LIFO exit strategy has much of the many technical issues the Committee now faces in trying to the level of short-term nominal interest rates in the United States.  The logic of rate liftoff seems quite compelling to me. An open question, then, about what we're balance sheet policy as we are thinking about raising the fed funds rate?  Is the balance sheet staying constant, or not tightening policy, then was balance sheet expansion not some logical difficulties policy reconsider some aspects of the LIFO exit strategy in light of the discussion in the staff concerning normalization of a large to commend it in view eventually raise first returning to our original pre-crisis, pre-unconventional policy situation before eventually attempting policy rate before any balance sheet reduction has been attempted, then the long list of questions the end of the first staff memo becomes relevant.  Let me now turn to those questions. questions posed refer to issues that are of only second-order the principal macroeconomic issue, which is control or substantial the U.S. economy.  As the staff memo states, money market rates when the time to exercise reasonable control over If we wish to remain with the current strategy, which calls for attempting to raise the policy posed at As a general remark, I think that the importance relative to influence over short-term interest rates in 'Policymakers can be confident that they will be able to raise to do so arrives, and that they will subsequently be able

April 29-30, 2014

I will refer to this question in just a moment. rates.'  There is, however, one issue that may be of first-order importance, which is the financialstability question, and

With a large balance sheet, I do not think the federal funds is a practical option as a target policy rate.  The federal funds market is essentially exists today.  Nor is it likely to gain economic meaning in the medium term.  I this particular we are most concerned about.  I have also been influenced meaning, such as repo, which is decided in a thicker market with many Let me turn to question 1:  Should the Committee continue to target the federal funds rate during the period of normalization? rate meaningless as it see it as somewhat detrimental to the Committee's credibility to claim that it is short-term nominal interest rate that by the arguments that the Committee should try to influence a short-term nominal interest rate with more economic more players trading.

trying to influence the general price of fruit would be to buy apples from, or sell the country until the desired level this would work to achieve the objective.  But in practice, I think it would work much, to trade apples with a wide variety of grocery stores across the country.  Something limited set of institutions itself. I like the following analogy.  Suppose we are by intervening in the market for apples.  One way to do this apples to, a particular grocery store at a particular location in of general fruit prices was obtained.  Given the way economic theory works, in principle, by arbitrage much better similar is going on with repo rates versus the federal funds rate, and to some extent with respect to the interest on excess reserves, which applies only to a

I think that this may be a difficult road to go down.  Suppose we wanted to create an Question 2.  In shifting away from the federal funds rate, would you support the development of a more robust measure of the overnight, unsecured bank funding rate to serve as a target? index of three different rates.  If the three different rates move in lockstep due to a robust

April 29-30, 2014

environment, there would be nothing to gain from aggregating the three rates.  But if were variable among the three rates, then the changes in the strength of index, creating an undesirable barometer of the move because the strength of arbitrage has changed and not the policy stance has changed.  For these reasons, I think that the creation of such an arbitrage the strength of arbitrage arbitrage would show up as variability in the stance of policy.  The index may because index may be problematic.

'an administered rate versus a market rate,' my staff questioned of the policy rule associated with a rate.  My staff said is really an administered rate-or is it a market rate?-because you are setting in reaction to developments in the economy, and that is informing the equilibrium of On the sub-question of the meaning of these terms.  We should be thinking in terms particular rate-that is, how the rate will be adjusted in reaction to economic developments-not whether we can label a particular rule as a market rate or as an administered that a Taylor rule the target the economy.  So they found this distinction to be moot.

I think if repo came to be FOMC communication would be sharp and effective.  There in the markets about where the FOMC stands. Question 3.  Are you supportive of a fixed-rate, full-allotment, overnight RRP I'm generally supportive, although I'm anxious to hear the views of others on the Committee.  I like the arguments about broader increasingly narrow segment of the U.S. financial intermediation sector, as President Fisher was talking about earlier today.  I will general, I think the spread of zero would be a good place then we could use caps if we are concerned about seen as the main focus of policy, would be little doubt

We should be thinking in terms of reducing focus on the federal funds rate. Question 4.  How should be allowed?  I meaningful interest expense may be associated with some options.  How are you with this?

In such theories, much would depend on other actions the Federal Reserve reduce the probability of a crisis or choice of a temporary operating regime itself.  My judgment is that we should not make choices on operating regimes based on the possible is a first-order concern for the Committee generally.

general, I am comfortable with testing as suggested in the memos.  Thank you, Madam Chair. And finally, on question 7, additional testing.  In additional

Like everyone else, I want to thank the for the outstanding memos.  It was a And thanks to you, Madam Chair, for our discussion this morning; I opportunity to have people talk about a lot of different productive session.

last meeting, my gut reaction tells me that it's very hard to talk about tactical when we don't know where we're going.  I used the phrase 'Yogi Berra' last time, that you've got to be careful if you don't know where you're going because you Committee isn't ready to make that kind of long-run decision about means my guiding principle in the meantime, we decide among these options on to pick options for the near-term tactical decisions that would preclude in the future.  So we need to keep our options available to us.  I think our goal today that have limited support, so we can focus more and perhaps promising and do more study on those. As I said adjustments when I said might end up somewhere else.  And I think we have to be careful about that, but, unfortunately, it's pretty clear that the where we end up, and I understand that.  So that much as I think Vice Chairman Dudley suggested, is that as the table, we don't want our options should be to try to eliminate some of the options exclusively on those that are feasible my own preference for the long run.  My own long-run preference is for us to to something that looks like a corridor operating framework, with some market or our target in the corridor, and with the Federal Reserve holding a mostly of short-term Treasuries.  This framework is laid out in June 2011.  So I don't really favor any I will give return interbank interest rate as relatively small portfolio comprised consistent with the exit strategy principles we option in the short run that would preclude us getting to that as our long-run operating

But there is no reason that system couldn't work well for us in the future as the balance sheet shrinks. arrangement, because as I said, during the crisis and with our large balance sheet, things have that thing to keep in mind is that, as President Lacker made clear, monetary more than just control over the precision of the short-term interest rate.  Monetary that guide our decision.  I think part. I think the other policy is policy decisions tend to look like a path of interest rates, and so we could become too obsessed with movements in the short-run rate, if we're not careful, and let we need to keep that in mind; that was a good caution on his

in mind, my own assessment is that I rule out option 1, which involves repo facility rate that equals the IOER rate.  Even if we choose step in the short run, it doesn't preclude us moving back to that some of our options that we do pursue turn out to be less may eviscerate the it be the federal funds market or other interbank lending that it would be hard to go back to them once we started targeting an It would be hard to go back to a market rate.  I think going with option 1 now that were raised about option 1 and the implications that facility might stress, a run of investors in the market to this facility seems real possibility that could create serious funding issues for some borrowers.  More am not entirely convinced that the Federal Reserve should be the market's primary sole supplier, of risk-free overnight assets other than currency.  That is a that might be created. With these caveats a full-allotment, overnight reverse to rule out option 1 now as a tactical that sometime later if we decide attractive for one reason or another.  Yet if we adopt option 1 now, we interbank lending markets, whether markets, to the point administered rate. does not preserve our options in an attractive way to me.  I am concerned about some of the financial-stability issues have.

thing that worries me a little bit in some of our discussions is some of the sizable expansion of our dealings with non-bank institutions that is mutual funds.  I'd like to understand the implicit scale of these operations in plumbing for the shortmoney market.  I think there are just a lot of ramifications we probably don't understand as The other political risk, given the required in these markets, such as money market consequences of that more broadly.  I'm concerned about the a full-allotment system and the potential unintended consequences on the term of yet.

me with options 3, 4, and 5.  Options 3 and 4 set an overnight rate of reverse another think that's something reasonable to explore.  Option 4 adds as well.  I have to with a attraction to options 3 and 4 than to 5. That leaves repos far enough below the IOER rate to preserve the federal funds market or perhaps interbank market of some kind.  I term deposits and term reverse repos.  Option 5 relies on other term tools confess, I'm a little nervous with the term instruments.  I would really prefer to stick market rate in overnight interbank markets or a reverse repo type-rate.  Therefore, I have a little more am open to redefining the federal funds rate or how we define the interbank to know more about the types of traders in this market.  What's the How much would we have to intervene?  What would the size of our balance sheet As I said, I market rate.  I'm open to different ways of thinking about that, whether it be Eurodollars or some other construct.  But I'd like scale of it?

raised serious concerns about money mutual funds.  And yet, as we broaden our definition of the market rate or administered and the counterparties we have to deal with, we are beginning to rely on money market monetary policy.  Can we square our money market mutual funds with using them as our primary mechanism?  I don't know the answer to that, but I think it's something we should The Federal Reserve and other regulators have market rate mutual funds as the primary transmission mechanism of two views of regulation of transmission give some thought.

more about the evolution of the Federal Reserve's in terms of and what it entails for our remittances.  And I think we could be exposing considerable political risk in this process. More generally, I'd like to know balance sheet under each of these options, in terms of its size and its composition short-term versus long-term assets that would be implied.  What would be the path of remittances?  I do have concerns about the Federal Reserve's exposure to interest rate risk under some of these options ourselves to the memos a bit strange in that the reason we are engaged in this is that we have created a very large balance sheet.  I mean, we did it, and so we are what's happening to the sheet and how it would be affected and how we want to manage that.  I think President Bullard alluded to this.  Thinking about our short-term thinking about how we are going to manage the balance sheet in the future, Indeed, I found all activity dealing with those issues, and in all of these memos we didn't talk about balance Fisher alluded to this, and President strategies, without

I think we need balance sheet shrinks, the kind of problems we are dealing with become is another way to deal with these issues. seems to be breaking this up in different pieces to think about our balance sheet more.  We need to think about how we envision shrinking it. And, by the way, as the less of an issue.  So that of which of these options are adopted, we need to start thinking about how to that mean doing things like beginning to either slow or eliminate meeting that, when we get to that stage, maybe in short-term Treasuries rather than MBS and long-term its in Regardless reduce the size of our balance sheet and how we can return it to a more normal size, sooner rather than later.  Does reinvestment policies?  I suggested at an earlier one of the things we do is reinvest Treasuries, as a way to create a more flexible structure of the balance sheet in terms of composition, which might be helpful as well.  So we need to think about some of those things conjunction with our operating framework.

questions, I am open to setting a range for time being.  Let's experiment becomes as we raise the IOER rate.  Do we need reverse RRPs to set a lower part of that range?  I think those are interesting things that we can short term as we begin to move forward.  We may find that we don't need to do it. the IOER rate goes up.  I don't know the answer to that.  So I important to get a better handle on, and I think proceeding in that Finally, before I get to the quick answers to the the fed funds target.  I think in the near term-several people have mentioned this-we can stick with a range; the markets have kind of gotten used to that for the with how big the spread firmer floor under the learn in the Maybe the spread doesn't widen as think those are things that are direction might be very, very helpful.

I am not in favor of going to the full-allotment I think we can always revert to that later on, but once we and concerns that. exploring different definitions of a target.  I overnight RRP facility at this point. revert to that it's going to be very hard to move back to anything else.  And I think I still have just too many questions the spread that is tolerable?  I don't have a real strong view monetary policy is not what the size of that spread might be, but other market rates are with that. The fourth question.  What's about that.  I think that, as I pointed out earlier-and as I think President Lacker pointed outwhat is really important for whether it is a useful signal for the path of monetary policy and whether moving more or less in tandem

U.S. government in some accounting sense.  Whether or where our political risk arises, I think, not in the different really all about our balance sheet, and nothing in these about that.  I think we need to think more about the balance sheet. Regarding net interest expense issues and remittances, I think the stuff talked about in the memos are sort of peanuts compared with the fact that we've got this huge balance sheet.  We've got $3 trillion of reserves.  We get the IOER rate up to 200 basis points, and that's $60 billion we are giving to banks, not giving to the not we are using an RRP facility versus the Term Deposit Facility is going to be peanuts compared with that number.  That is methods we're talking about here.  That's memos really talks and the different spreads, I'm all fine for options 6 and 7, do not want to go to the full-allotment test.  I don't think that's called If other things don't work out, that's may want to consider, but I wouldn't want to go there yet.  Thank you, Madam With regard to further testing which is more testing.

are several ways to proceed.  I expect to narrow our proposals over the next several meetings until we arrive at a MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  And thanks to the staff for a lot of hard work on the memos.  We have known for some time that our eventual policy normalization would be challenging.  As our discussion revealed just now, there that we will continue workable and effective consensus approach.

couple of comments at this point.  I think our monetary policy task is our ability to adjust a short-term policy rate more restrictive financial conditions.  As Vice Chairman Dudley really the most important objective, and I think most everybody around the I have just a relatively straightforward.  We want to preserve when it comes time to impose mentioned, this is table has echoed that.

the time for tightening is not near.  My submission for the March had the first policy rate liftoff in the first quarter of 2016-if rates that we could employ:  the IOER rate, the overnight reverse repo rate, the fed funds and others.  As long as these candidate rates remain the U.S. credit and intermediation might work as the primary focus of our policy actions, it seems to me.  I volatility of the funds rate and of the other rates more on the relative efficacy of the various approaches on the table, I remain way to proceed on this front. I personally believe that Summary of Economic Projections anybody didn't already know that.  But of course, we do need to plan.  We have a variety of interest rate or its next generation, the GC repo rate, relevant for the pricing of other market interest rates in process, any of them agree with President Lacker's comment that the are really of secondary importance relative to our policy objectives.  So until we have discriminating evidence relatively open-minded as to the best

that some of these U.S. economy. we find a shorter way to describe appealing properties for supplying much sought-after short-term safeassets, these new financial products may change the industry landscape, and maybe Now, that said, I found the briefing documents helpful for pointing out new tools could have a bearing on altering financial instability risk for the Although the creation of overnight reverse repo assets-can that, please?-has some instrument by a lot.

to President Plosser's point that we need to be thinking about the couldn't stop thinking about it, really.  And I don't know how to finesse it.  I mean, maybe we don't need to have a firm opinion about that I'm quite sympathetic endpoint-others have said that, too-of where we want to be.  And once I started thinking about what the long-term landscape of the financial industry might be because of the introduction of these nice, safe assets, I disengage from that or just to make a decision in September.  But I think we have to have that endpoint in mind.

mutual market fund assets and instruments that are associated with them?  Maybe this is trivial and negligible.  That I tried to pose.  But I was focusing on sure we engaged on that quite enough.  I would want strong assurances that we don't somehow mistake that affects the credit process.  I'm also not sure how I feel about the monetary policy tools could significantly alter a large financial It's not clear to me how this will work.  For example, how would money market funds that specialize in overnight reverse repo assets affect other money the credit was sort of the commentary I got from the questions that the longer term; I'm not that no unintended credit crunch could emerge for any important nonfinancial enterprise.  I think that as we try to normalize policy, we are going to want to make sure create some kind of possibility that our choice of services industry segment.  Perhaps this industry evolution is inevitable, but it does seem a bit far removed from our normal monetary policymaking considerations, as well as the more immediate

But, again, I remain open-minded on the use of overnight reverse repo assets don't really intend to answer those questions.  [Laughter]  I say that I don't think we should pay too much attention to the interest with these different programs.  That's just not something that when making tough monetary policy decisions, and I don't think we doing that now.  I am sensing from other commentary so far that option 3 seems to many participant views expressed already, and that could be fine with could pick option 3 out of a police Chair. Now, regarding the seven questions, I am extremely pleased to say that I am in complete agreement with President Fisher.  I am open-minded.  I will expenses that we are going to incur we normally think about should start be at the intersection of me.  Although I have to say very seriously that I'm not sure I lineup.  [Laughter].

was hoping that my last FOMC meeting side.  But once I started to receive memos and the agenda, I realized that wasn't going to be the case.  Indeed, this may end attended.  But, on a positive note, I have memos that were prepared by the meeting gives me the opportunity to quality time with my FOMC colleagues.  [Laughter] MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I would be fairly straightforward and would be on the shorter the staff up being one of the longest meetings I will have benefited from the learning gained by reading the excellent staff and listening to today's rich discussion, and the longer spend more more serious note, the number and length of the excellent background memos today's discussion make it clear that the issues surrounding the monetary policy are among the most complex the Committee has addressed in On a circulated to the Committee and normalization of

As an aside, only Chair Yellen, President Lacker, and I were here the time the FOMC began policy normalization, back in June of 2004 when we raised the fed lot simpler back then.  But at the time, it didn't seem very simple. my 11 years of service. last funds rate, and it was a today's discussion is just a first step in a sequence of discussions that will be these discussions Mester, who will be sitting I am going to be brief in my comments today.  Rather than trying direct answers to the detailed questions put to the Committee, I will instead offer a few for the Committee I know that needed to eventually decide on a framework and to implement it.  And because and decisions will rest with all of you, and with my successor, Loretta at this seat at the next meeting, to give high-level comments that I hope will be of help to you when the time comes to make some decisions.

that I find to be helpful in evaluating the options for policy that in the long run the policy instrument should be the federal a similar market rate should the federal funds should be one that is they are important.  Basing policy on a clearly puts the responsibility where it is supposed to be, and that with public accountability and transparency. the longer-run framework cannot use rates that are administered by target for the Committee's policy instrument. There are two principles normalization.  First, I believe funds rate, or an augmented federal funds rate or rate not prove to be viable.  In my view, I think that the policy instrument set by this Committee rather than just by the Board of Governors.  We have discussed the related governance issues before, and I continue to believe that rate like the federal funds rate is with the FOMC.  And such a framework helps Now, this doesn't mean that the Board of Governors to support a that I find helpful is that the best course of action will be one that memos The second principle does preserve a high degree of flexibility, as others have commented today.  As the staff point out, there are many uncertainties surrounding normalization.  As one example, we don't

April 29-30, 2014

testing of some of our tools will in larger-scale implementation.  Broadly stated, the Federal Reserve has never been in to adjust tools and approaches is likely to know if the market behavior we observe in the small-scale change these circumstances before, and preserving the ability prove important.

just a few comments to make on normalization.  For to target the fed going to have a role in the longer-run operating it should have a role in the normalization period.  As the background make little or no use of the federal funds rate So using these two principles, I have one, during policy normalization, I believe that the Committee should continue funds rate or a similar market rate.  If that rate is framework, I think that memos describe, normalization approaches that could kill off trading in the federal funds market, which would likely make it difficult to revive the market in the future.

to draw on a range of tools during the target for the federal funds rate, including overnight RRPs, the should be useful when the time comes. My second comment is that it is desirable normalization to support IOER rate, and the reserve draining tools.  The memos make it clear that each tool has limitations, but a combination of these tools much about the Deposit Facility, while at the same time clearly communicating that not bear on the likely timing of policy tightening.  Thank you, Madam Chair. And finally, I would recommend proceeding with caution.  Over time, the staff has been able to develop a range of tools, and careful, gradual testing has taught us efficacy of the tools.  The Federal Reserve will need to continue with cautious testing of both reverse repos and the Term testing does

standpoint, the elevated size of our balance sheet is likely going to in the early stages of policy normalization, so I agree that RRP during this phase of the process.  That said, completely in a long-run gradually returning the sheet to a more normal level.  At this point, however, I am open to enhanced testing range of tools to provide optionality with respect to our framework. From a practical preclude targeting the fed funds rate we should be prepared to lean on the overnight at this stage, I would prefer not to abandon the federal funds target strategy for steering short-term rates, because my own preference is for balance across a that could support highly money markets by encouraging a broad range of depositories, including smaller in short-term money markets along the lines of the segregated balance tools may also provide some insight into how they interact money markets.  My preferred approach right now is to the memos, as we will likely need to I would also be interested in testing strategies for facilities competitive banks, to transact accounts.  Testing a number of these with one another and affect short-term eliminate, as others have noted, the extremes presented in do some learning as we undertake normalization.  So, like others, I would focus primarily on options 2 and 3 at this stage.

spread to the IOER rate and move cautiously to utilize counterparty caps for the time being.  I would end of the In terms of the spread on the overnight RRPs during the normalization process, I would prefer to take an approach that maintains a wide toward full allotment, and continue support taking steps toward moving the overnight RRP toward 15 basis points by the year, simply to ensure we have a reasonably well-developed sense of how well it acts as a floor. And after liftoff, I could also see even a wider spread between the overnight RRP rate and the

well this rate acts as a floor.  If it's funds rate via a floor system.  If, to act as a floor because of idiosyncratic reasons within the funds market, then implementing monetary policy.

Thank you, Madam staff for their hard work and thoughtful analysis on the various memos.  I thought this discussion was very enlightening for me, and I'll echo President Fisher: would benefit from having further, possibly intermeeting, conversations move forward to a decision point, I

lot of talk about learning by doing and learning as we go along.  And I think this is, of I do think exit that is robust enough to deal with the risks might arise that would require us to raise rates relatively rapidly. up should be robust enough to deal now, but I think the idea of just be possible given the macroeconomic objectives that we are trying to Before I launch into my prepared remarks, I just want to make one comment that there has been a course, going to be really important whatever we end up doing in terms of exit.  But we have to have a framework for thinking about possibility that inflation And whatever we end up doing, whatever framework we set with that possibility.  I'm not saying that we are there right groping along might not achieve.

high-level comments about the deliberations and relatively firm, and then I'm going a way forward.  I haven't said this for a I'm going to begin by making three communications.  These first three high-level comments are to be a little more speculative and tentative in suggesting

April 29-30, 2014

it's a pleasure to be able to say it.  A lot of my comments are going to agree with that after a long time. while, but much that President Lacker had to say.  It's a pleasure to be able to say [Laughter]

my high-level comments, the first comment relates to the 2011 exit-strategy the likely role of asset sales during exit, the FOMC's desire for a small longthe FOMC's desire for an all-Treasury long-run balance sheet.  I do think exit are less likely to be viewed as credible if we are not able to provide a In terms of principles.  In June 2011, the FOMC enunciated a set of exit-strategy principles with the support of all but one FOMC participant.  Those principles emphasize the role of the federal funds rate target during exit, run balance sheet, and that when we communicate about our desired operational framework and, really, as we talk about it, we should be more connected back to those June 2011 principles.  I think our new communications about convincing or compelling rationalization for why we are deviating from the June 2011 principles. That is my first comment.

FOMC needs to be able the likely evolution of its policy stance.  I think effective an important criterion for our choice of operational think we should be thinking about this as let's get the operational framework job of reducing, say, the volatility of money market interest rates.  I think, what is going to be the best framework that will allow us to to communicate effectively about the future arc of policy.  A complicated framework rates and targets may well hinder that effective communication. My second high-level comment is about communication, more generally, and monetary policy is fundamentally about expectations management.  I think that the to communicate effectively about communication should be viewed as framework.  I don't that will do the best really, we should be thinking about be able with multiple administrative

April 29-30, 2014

high-level comment is about the possible risk to financial stability.  As I my questions this morning, I found the memos to be especially useful in there is some upside with this facility as well, mitigating these risks.  But I see it as very asymmetrical.  If the Federal Reserve's was seen as being responsible for fostering a financial panic we were to go forward would like to have in place very strong safeguards to least, that the caps alone represent such a strong safeguard. And my final mentioned in some of my thinking and highlighting how an overnight RRP facility could increase the probability and severity of a financial panic.  It is true that potentially creation of a new overnight facility in any way, I think that, first of all, that would be bad from a policymaking point of view, but it would also, of course, be bad from a reputational point of view.  Before with implementing such a facility, I mitigate adverse side effects of financial instability.  As I hinted at this morning in my questions, I am not convinced, at this stage at and communications about exit back to what we said in June 2011.  We should be that our new operational framework is carefully designed to facilitate effective the evolution of policy.  And we should not adopt an overnight facility Those are my three high-level, relatively firm comments.  I think we should be tying our discussions ensuring communication about unless we have a great deal of confidence that we are not fostering the risk of financial instability.

it is going to be similar to what President Lacker had to say.  It's a relatively simple interest rate target; the Board sets the interest rate the federal funds the federal funds rate does not exceed the target set by the FOMC; and we funds rate does not fall below the target. Now I am going to be more tentative and turn to a suggested approach to exit and, as I said earlier, version of option 5:  The FOMC specifies our on excess reserves equal to that target, and the Desk makes transactions in market only to ensure don't use draining of any kind to ensure that the federal

April 29-30, 2014

the approach, and I'll state it again in a second.  But why is this appropriate?  My FOMC achieves its goals of maximum employment and price stability funds rate on excess reserves.  Now, we are always about shaping banks' incentives, and there the data, and President Lacker did a good job of there are always gaps that emerged between our target rate and what was aggregate demand, which is ultimately what we're about. That's starting point is that the by influencing the incentives of banks to make loans.  Operationally, before 2008, the FOMC shaped banks' incentives to make loans by varying a specified target for the federal funds rate. The crux of my argument is going to be that, given that we can pay IOER, the operational equivalent is now for the FOMC to specify a target for the maximum of the federal and interest are always gaps that emerged.  If you look at talking about this, going on in money markets.  Those gaps moved around, but it didn't get in the way of our ability to influence and the interest of excess reserves?  Well, right now, in time, banks have a choice among selling federal funds to other banks, holding return is higher the interest on excess reserves.  Before 2008, the interest on to worry about it.  The only relevant alternative for target for the federal funds rate.  After 2008, the Federal Reserve was set the interest on excess reserves to be above zero.  Now, there are two rates that can the federal funds rate or the interest on excess reserves.  The key point is when the excess reserves is higher than the federal funds rate, as it is now, banks then decide Why is it the right thing to be doing, the operational equivalent now, to specify a target for the maximum of the federal funds rate at any point reserves, and making loans.  That means that the bank will only make a loan if its than both the fed funds rate and excess reserves was zero, so you didn't have the bank was the federal funds rate, and that's why you could shape banks' incentive to make loans by changing the allowed to be relevant: interest on

April 29-30, 2014

return with the IOER rate.  The federal funds whether to make a loan by comparing the loan's rate is irrelevant because it's dominated by the interest rate on reserves.

that their average borrowing cost.  On the margin, their financing marginal increase in their borrowing to invest in the high IOER.  On the margin, they indifferent between how they're financing and IOER.  There might be other borrowers money market rate, but the banks themselves are marginally Now, I want to be clear about one thing here.  We do see banks borrowing at rates are lower than IOER, but that's costs are going to be equal to the IOER rate, because otherwise they would have an incentive to make that have to be that are able to get that low indifferent.

I see as a very simple exit strategy for the FOMC.  At each meeting, the the target interest rate, and then the Desk should conduct operations in the market, if necessary, to ensure that the fed funds rate does not exceed that target rate.  There is no draining in this approach.  Basically, when the federal funds rate is is just not influencing banks' decisionmaking, so we can ignore it. That's what Committee should specify our desired target interest rate.  The Board of Governors should set IOER rate equal to that fed funds interest lower than the IOER rate, it are going to emerge between various short-term interest this approach to monetary policy.  Right now, the low federal funds rate means that Home Loan Banks are earning a very low overnight return on their investments to the IOER rate.  More generally, not all loans in the economy come from banks. the commercial paper market may well be able to obtain loans at President Lacker pointed out, will limit such gaps.  I will add that we do not have a theory to indicate are efficient or inefficient.  And, finally, whether we did or not, that's There are going to be gaps that rates under the Federal relative Borrowers who have access to more favorable terms than those offered by banks.  But, as arbitrage considerations to us whether such gaps

job of monetary policy.  It is not to eliminate all gaps between short-term interest rates. in an effective fashion by influencing banks' make loans.  I am proposing a change to the June 2011 exit principles, which funds rate target.  I think we can rationalize reorienting to the the federal funds rate is essentially irrelevant for bank is as low as it currently is.  And so the relevant margin is the IOER rate. not the The job of monetary policy is to shape aggregate demand by influencing the overall tightness of credit conditions, and we can, I believe, do that incentives to emphasize the role of the federal IOER rate by pointing out, as I have, that decisionmaking when it Thank you, Madam Chair.

characterized go a step further and say that mine are very tentative, with respect to the final shape of an intermediate strategy. MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  A number of people have their remarks as tentative, and I will particularly point in which I actually have considerably greater confidence, couple of President Kocherlakota's introductory remarks.  I that most people have to maintain optionality, on the one hand, and, hand, the fact that we all acknowledge there's incomplete knowledge of a lot of for the next iteration of this exercise, timeline in the following respects.  One, what we would expect the Chair to say in matter of communication, as President to raise whatever the target interest rate would be at that time.  The reason I suggest I'll begin with a process and in some ways this picks up on a guess because of the desire on the other what might happen as we begin to exit, I would suggest that as the staff generates materials for us, they try to generate them in a pretty concrete fashion that gives us a September or shortly thereafter, which is both a Kocherlakota was suggesting, and an indication of what we have to decide by then.  Two, an understanding of what kinds of decisions we would subsequently need to make before we're in a position

April 29-30, 2014

in that concrete way is that it will both let us see how the optionality and incomplete time and test whether we feel comfortable going forward, or do through more first.  It might also allow us to agree that we can put off some doing it knowledge issues play out over we need to think this decisions that are interesting and otherwise might divert us along the way.

what Richard suggested in mind where we each think we affects these intermediate decisions.  I guess I would note first what some of you have shifted its monetary policy regime a number of changing time for doing so again would be in reaction to a major financial crisis and a huge monetary and regulatory policies that existed in the period preceding the crisis. Now, having just made that suggestion, I will-mindful of earlier, which I think is absolutely right that we should bear may want to go-make a couple of comments about that potential final destination, particularly as it alluded to, which is that the Federal Reserve has times over the course of its history-largely, presumably, in response to the circumstances of the financial system and the economy.  One would think that a particularly appropriate recession that followed, that were themselves connected, I think, to shortcomings in the combination of taken account, markets with conventional lending that crisis.  And, again, echoing something President said earlier, the decreased amount of intermediation by banks meant both that there were about the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission, but, quite apart from that, that outside the monetary policy as then pursued or regulatory supervisory policy as then all.  Unless I mean, it does seem to me that the public policy framework had never ultimately, of the increasing integration of capital occurred in the roughly 30 years preceding the Fisher questions it was possible to build up substantial risks to financial stability in a fashion that was embrace either of pursued.  As we sit here today, we've changed some of those circumstances, but not one has enormous confidence in the ability and authority to develop time-varying

April 29-30, 2014

last year or so, a number of people have made the very salient comment that they don't a macroeconomic problem, and so of raised the threshold for the amount of financial-stability risk that they want to see allows for were a decade ago when, as mentioned, the FOMC was engaged in its last exit. I'm thinking of the fact that as we have talked about financial stability from time to time over the want to be put into a situation of tightening when there's such they've sort before doing so.  It seems to me that if we can develop a monetary policy regime that a more nuanced reaction to financial-stability concerns without a general tightening of interest rates that we will have progressed substantially beyond where we President Pianalto

I have to say it seems to me that it's that tool and to continue to develop it and use it in the normalization using it.  But I do think that it has some potential-and this was most obvious in the are a lot of questions around the net use of the facility and the idea of of safe assets.  But I do think those are the kinds of questions that we effect of our actions on risk premiums, premiums, and whether there is some way of pursuing a monetary policy that That leads me to the overnight reverse repo facility. highly desirable to have process.  I guess one could do without it, but it seems to me kind of clunky to try to proceed very far without memo that Governor Stein helped the staff with, or the staff helped Governor Stein with, one way or another [laughter], a collective process-and there impact on financial stability of the particular approach to the creating a huge amount need to tackle, and we have to think about things like the particularly term

that are or are not worth pursuing.  I did want to say the case that we've been pursuing a set of regulatory and supervisory initiatives with funding side of your book.  I am unaware of-unless the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond telling us about-any supervisory decisions within the LISCC to the IOER rate.  And I will say I think the fact that the FBOs and the domestic banks are not is kind of a good real-world experiment because the the leverage ratio or the FDIC fee.  The FBOs do have our supervisors, correct. In a moment I will-notwithstanding the tentativeness-try to give a few provisional preferences on instruments or ideas something, though, in response to President Lacker's comments on supervision and matched books.  It is designed to constrain the development and maintenance of very large matched books private actors on all sides because of the potential for runs that then result in cutting off to the other is doing something they're not discourage the use of arbitrage with are doing it FBOs don't have either and particularly the Federal Reserve Bank of New York supervisors, crawling all over them on the liquidity problems and liquidity issues that have existed.  I actually think the explanation that the memo suggested is probably more likely to be a good sense at all, even a structure of a sense, of looking for-in the are less worth pursuing and others more, I'll at least Like many should try to fix the federal funds rate, and I'd echo what President along the way.  In terms of options, it doesn't feel to me as though do want to be tentative on that.  Like Vice In concluding, as I said, I don't have what our plan should be, but-I think this is probably what Bill English is interest of being able to say that some things state a couple of preferences.

you, Governor Tarullo.  Governor Stein. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank also thank the staff not only for the that President Fisher did, which is I know we don't need to be trying to the long-run question now.  Nevertheless, I found it useful to start by thinking about the MR. STEIN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Let me memos but for the many, many helpful conversations that we've had in the run-up to this.  I won't try to answer all the questions.  I'll just try to venture some general thoughts.  I also kind of had the same reaction answer long-run question.

In the long run, what kind of money do responses.  One we saw our franchise as providing currency and there's a world in which we see our job as providing not only that's conceptually like Treasury billslarger in the case in which you take me start by just trying to think about the pros and cons of these two To me, the long-run question boils down to this: we see ourselves being the provider of?  I think there are basically two possible is, we go back to the old world in which reserves.  That's it.  Alternatively, currency and reserves, but also some kind of safe asset namely, our RRPs.  These are two pretty different mission statements, and they involve potentially different balance sheet sizes, obviously quite a bit on this other thing.  Let different tasks for the Fed.

good argument to be made-obviously provisional at this job, and it's quite close to what Dan articulated financial stability.  Think about our efforts on the regulatory side with the leverage I actually think there's a point-for broadening the way we see doing our in terms of

April 29-30, 2014

the idea of doing capital surcharges for short-term wholesale funding, We're basically, in various ways, trying to lean against the private sector's efforts guys doing that.  Well, you might cheap.  It's cheap to fund at the very, very short end of the Why is it cheap?  Because somehow the world has not supplied enough of the sort short-term money-like assets.  So they trade at a private ratio, we thought about and so forth. to create very, very short-term money-like claims, which they do when they basically hold longterm assets and fund them with repos.  We sort of don't like want to step back in all of this regulatory effort and say, 'Why in the world are they doing it?' Well, they're doing it because it's yield curve. of assets that money funds like:  very, very safe premium in price or, let's say, they have very, very low yields.  If we don't do it, the sector will.  We can fight that with regulation, but, as Governor Tarullo says, doing it all with regulation is a heavy lift.

that stuff ourselves, and in fact when, for example, the supply of Treasury bills goes to say, the yields go up and the private sector We're maturity transformation and you're An alternative is to try to crowd it out by providing more of there's some empirical evidence that up, the specialness premium goes down-that is backs away and does less of that maturity transformation stuff.  The big, big picture here would be if we provide more repo-like stuff to the world, that eliminates some of the scarcity. saying to the private sector, we're going to do some of the going to do less.

a radical thing to do?  Is this a radical way to think about what we're doing? it like you guys did, like both President Fisher and Governor Tarullo did. capital markets world, and so what is money has sense, and that would be the theory of the case.  President Lacker day, we didn't provide Now, is this I sort of thought about The world is really changing, and it's more of a changed in some fundamental pointed out-we had a conversation offline about this-that, back in the

April 29-30, 2014

to that.  That would be sort of the currency.  The private banks provided bank notes, and at some point the decision was made that that wasn't all that good for financial stability, so we took that job away from the private sector. This, in some ways, would be a bit of a modern-day analogue big pitch for doing this at some point.

a serious expansion of what we do.  There are expanding repo-only money funds changes the calculus somewhat. to expanding our footprint in the conventional money fund sector, I to doing it this way. Obviously, there are a bunch of cons.  It's political issues.  There are all of the issues that we had earlier in the discussion about the role of money funds, which I think are serious.  I do think this idea of restricting our participation to purely Treasury-only or While I would be averse might be less averse been kind of fond of the segregated balance accounts, and riskless money funds is just another, and maybe a more elegant, mean, think about it from the perspective of a corporate cash managers who asset can put their money into without having a subsidy.  If they put it there's some kind of a subsidy there.  If they put it into a money a subsidy there.  But if they into something that's really riskless, maybe that's actually not a bad outcome. By the way, I've always actually doing this thing with the legally and kind of operationally, way to do it.  I corporate cash manager.  We're just trying to find something that are dying to have a safe into Citibank, we worry that fund that's commingling risky and riskless stuff, we worry there's put it

Ex ante , it's good to take maturity transformation away. Ex post , if you are really the seems like a very serious thing.  But I think that seems tractable.  I mean, you basically cap it. There are many ways to

There's no reason to try to do anything that marches in this direction right now.  I just would hate to see it fall off the table as is big, because as long as the balance sheet is as big as it is, we're very likely to how that works, learning about how our We only really get to a fork in the road when the asset side Anyway, this is all long-run stuff.  Based on what I know now, which is pretty limited, I would be sympathetic particularly well.  I think we want to preserve optionality.  I don't think that optionality goes away as long as the balance sheet be doing some repo funding and learning about counterparties behave and all of that. starts wanting to go down, and we could go back to a world in which basically we don't need the repo funding.  But, I think, for the next few years, there's really no choice on this dimension.

tree a little bit, and I think very same spirit that many others have said.  I don't see any reason to go to option 1 in to option 1, but we any idea of how much quantity we would get by putting the RRP rate all the way up IOER rate.  I don't see why you'd want to do that. In terms of short-run stuff, let me start by just pruning the much in the the short run.  Maybe in the long run, this view takes you somewhere close don't know enough now to want to set this.  That would be a pretty aggressive thing to do.  We don't have with the why you'd do option 5 or even really option 4.  I think Vice number of others have made this point.  I'm not a fan, based on what I that we should try to is not because we care per se.  It's because it's the Friedman rule.  Funding think the TDF is a leading expensive to the extent that we get traction over the fed I don't particularly see Chairman Dudley and a understand about the Term Deposit Facility.  I do think this sort of maxim fund ourselves cheap yourself cheap often is associated with good, normative properties.  I example.  We would fund ourselves

April 29-30, 2014

is, it's because we've made the federal funds rate in the TDF.  Then some poor bank did too much of that, and they're the high funds rate, but fine, up, but it's now a rate that's pretty divorced from other market rates.  I the appeal of that. funds rate by doing it with a TDF.  My instinct some really odd thing; we've managed to make them get rid of all their short-term overnight reserves by putting it scrambling for reserves at the end of the day.  You manage to print we've got the funds rate don't see question-what like what we're doing now, but just a little bit more-in other words, rate on the RRP, increasing the quantity, tightening up the literally between now and September or between range is whatever we think is an acceptable range, What does that leave us with?  Actually-and this is very much to Dan's do we actually need to do between now and September?  I think we're likely to be doing something quite a bit probably raising incrementally the link.  At some point we could be doing this now and liftoff.  We'll start seeing that the and at that point there will be some comfort in going out and talking about the range.

to be made by September is not a decision a fork in the relationship is, 'The Committee today in the statement announces the following repo rate to make it tight that doesn't have to be talked about so much as a central policy thing.  An feel less comfortable focusing on the funds rate, would be to make the a strong view yet as to those.  I understand there's sort of a conservative appeal in I actually think the biggest decision that needs about how it's going to operate but how we talk about it.  In other words, here there's the road.  You can say one of two things.  One thing you can say once we've gotten enough tightness in target range for the federal funds rate.'  That's what goes in the statement; that's what gets talked about.  Behind the curtain, Simon and New York are moving around the enough, but alternative option, if we statement about, 'Here's the IOER rate.  Here's the repo rate.'  That's what we'll communicate. I don't have

is an 'unalloyed good' irrespective of those, and I think that's And, finally, I just would strongly endorse, whichever of those two one does, the virtue of robustifying the funds rate certainly something worth pursuing.  Thank you.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  Governor Powell. CHAIR

MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  First of all, let me say, I did not know until today that 'robustify' was actually a word.

MR. TARULLO.  It is not, it's a neologism.  [Laughter]

questions are buried in my remarks, and I'm going to start with, really, more interesting issues in the end. MR. POWELL.  So, a great set of memos, very interesting discussion, and thanks for that.  My answers to the the practical short-term alternatives, and then come back a little bit to the longer-term are two approaches that seem to me to be pretty workable.  First, I do find a specific policy rate.  That is our option would give the Committee the best control over short-term rates at the We are going to be in a de facto floor system anyway for a while, due to the high that reality and doesn't The practical need is to announce after the September meeting a plan for the mechanics of liftoff and for the foreseeable future, during which the balance sheet will be very large.  And for that period, there some attraction in a floor system in which the Committee uses the IOER rate and RRP rate to set a rough floor for short-term rates and doesn't set number 2.  A floor system lowest cost. level of reserves.  What this approach does is it just kind of accepts complicate matters by adding a target rate.

April 29-30, 2014

facility at the lowest level that would achieve a clean liftoff.  Part of that, I have to admit, is the cognitive Charlie Plosser mentioned-simultaneously noting that money market funds are threat to financial stability as well as a principal conduit for our monetary policy.  Now, money funds does have the attraction of I'm not sure, but for me, at the beginning, it trillions.  And what I would do is gradually move to the IOER rate to achieve the desired size.  What would that spread be?  I narrower than the current 20 basis points.  I am not inclined to move to new risk-free asset to the world. little doubt in my mind that the world would take us up on that in a crisis.  I would, as experiment with size caps and with using the price mechanism-for For now, I would want to size that RRP reasonably tight floor and enable a dissonance that a grave the idea of limiting our contacts to government addressing that problem.  How large would that be? would be in the hundreds of billions, not the the RRP up closer don't know.  It would be a full-allotment RRP, which would be a promise to supply a There is we discussed earlier, example, by switching to a single-price auction if demand exceeds the quantity limit.  These would be appropriate subjects for testing.

the federal funds market, already highly idiosyncratic, would lose further liquidity under a problems of contract down the road, it is said, to return to a corridor system based me that we could meet the first set of issues by broadening to include Eurodollar rates, maybe other unsecured interbank borrowing It also seems to me that if a future Committee wanted to return in the longer term to a rate or the broader overnight bank funding rate, or, for I see two main objections to this explicit floor system during normalization.  The first is that floor system and maybe cease to be a useful benchmark.  There would be frustration, and it might be difficult on the federal funds rate.  It seems to the federal funds rate rates. market-based target, like the federal funds that matter, to a secured rate like GC repo, I believe it would be straightforward to do so.  So I'm

April 29-30, 2014

think that they are going to be there them. not too worried about preserving options down the road.  I for us if we want to use the more difficult objection for me is that the size of the balance sheet is a that I'm particularly in a rush to shrink the sheet now, but I'm just not yet comfortable with the idea today that we should the balance sheet.  Fortunately, I don't think we're making the use of a floor system during this interim period as implying a choice to do so.  I would be comfortable with this explicit floor approach during Actually, matter of choice under a floor system.  It's not balance permanently and massively enlarge that decision now.  I don't see longer-term normalization.

the Committee targets would be all as a fatal flaw.  This would be a natural practice, as Governor Stein just noted, and more familiar to the markets. lot to me. Second, during liftoff and normalization, I could also get comfortable with a corridor system in which RRP sets the floor, the IOER rate sets the ceiling, and something in between, either the federal funds or overnight bank funding rate.  There perhaps less-precise control, which I don't see at extension of the current It probably represents the easiest, least risky, least surprising thing to do, and that actually recommends it quite a a fix to the federal funds rate, and there mechanics to work out, but there is just about enough time to do that.  I have to to me and less well-linked to the evolution of the a feeling that we would be going back in time to a comfortable old to suit the markets of the future. If this system is to work, there would need to be would be some admit, this approach seems slightly less elegant credit markets.  Intermediation is moving outside of the banking system, and it is moving to secured rates.  There is system rather than allowing our policy framework to evolve

second approach is also more expensive.  If the spread remains about 15 basis points is $4½ billion per year in unnecessary cash payments, mainly to hold one-half of the reserves and growing.  So I am concerned about the really want to see the best estimates we can come up with to talk about the margin that we have thing. The on $3 trillion in reserves, that large foreign banks that remittances, and I would this.  It could be significant, and it could actually make it more likely at a period of zero remittances, which would not be a positive the without emphasizing them.  The idea of testing term deposit facilities the draining tools, as such, as particularly useful or important.  I and principally cosmetic at this point, when we have $3 trillion in wouldn't have any urge to use them.  I guess I would use them if I had to, which me into option 4, if the repo floor turns out to be too leaky. But I think either of those two approaches could work pretty well.  I would leave other tools on the table seems okay.  I also don't look at see them as expensive reserves.  I would take

me turn to the longer-term issues.  And, again, these are not things we need to today, but they're on the list of questions, so I'll go ahead and talk about them.  And I or a small one?  What kind of rate?  How will around IOER at the end of the day?  And, finally, should we policy framework to do things other than implement traditional monetary policy in a Finally, let decide would include in this group such questions as, what is the ideal system?

At the same time, large balance sheet might prove to be a magnet for trouble over time, and pull me in opposite directions, I admit.  So I tentatively land on a floor On the first, I do think that over floor approach may be simpler and cheaper I kind of think that a those two considerations

But that brings you to the really interesting were all over, and that is the use of system with the smallest question, I think, that Governor Tarullo and Governor Stein the balance sheet for financial-stability purposes.  Very, very interesting questions, and I don't have a lot to add on them here today, but I think those are the things we are going to be talking about for years to come.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Well, thank you, Governor Powell, and thank you to everyone.  I had a great discussion of this.  We have really dug into the issues.  I'm not going to if I know a wide range of views were expressed, where some common ground lies.  We will think about how best to the presentations and decisions at our next meeting in June, when we can hopefully CHAIR think we've try to provide a summary, but, listening to the go-round, I will work with the staff to try to see we have found some common ground here.  While I think I can begin to see structure move further in a practical direction of finding a way forward.  But I think for today we have had a great discussion.

What we did here for what the paydowns would look like was split the difference between assuming that you reinvested in 2015 and assuming that you didn't reinvest.

And then it gets substantially larger, because under the MEP we basically sold everything that was less than 3¼ years.  And that ended at the For the mortgage-backed securities, it will depend on what the principal paydowns are.  Chart 18 shows you one estimate of that.  One of the strange little issues is the paydowns on the portfolio partly depend on what the reinvestment policy is, and you can get different

DUDLEY.  I have a question about the uncertainty about the this something about?  Are they clamoring for more information, or are they very having this uncertainty sort of sit out there? VICE CHAIRMAN reinvestments.  Are we being asked about when we are going to clarify this?  Is that people are anxious comfortable to know, and to know because it tells them something else about what we might be definitely, a reason to focus on the mortgage market, if you look at chart 18, is that the effect relative to issuance yet.  So many of the mortgage traders do are correct, and we will see some increase in as we go through the year and the share of the issuance that we are it's the case that the early. MR. POTTER.  I think people in the mortgage market would really like other people would like doing.  But we haven't really seen believe in the flow effect.  It is possible that they the mortgage spreads purchasing goes down.  And they are obviously interested whether reinvestments would end

DUDLEY.  I have a general question for the Committee, then.  Is any reason why we shouldn't clarify this? VICE CHAIRMAN there

POWELL.  It seems like it's getting to be about time to do it, right? DUDLEY.  Well, or certainly you might want to do.  If we're going reinvestments. MR.

YELLEN.  Are you agreeing maybe that's something we can discuss in the next questions for Simon?  President Bullard. CHAIR meeting, next two meetings?  Other meeting?  Are you going to say that the run-up from the JEC higher, expected average inflation are much higher, and term premiums were much higher? MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I am looking at exhibit 1, items 3 and 4. How reasonable is that decomposition of the decline in the nominal five-year, five-year forward rate since the December FOMC testimony to the FOMC meeting would sort of be the opposite graph of this, in which market players thought that expected average real rates were much rates

like of the reaction function of the Fed following the confusion market participants is unusual to see so little weight put on the the 10-year in this very narrow range for many months now.  There are a of explanation rather than the red.  If you look at the real MR. POTTER.  I think if we had asked this question-and we did ask questions this-the term premiums explanation and uncertainty of the reaction function of the Fed were the leading answers.  We did ask that question after the June meeting, and there was a lot uncertainty over had, particularly with the press conference.  To me, it term premiums as an explanation.  This has not been a very sharp move, which you'd usually associate with the reversal of term premiums that were too low.  This has been just a gradual move, and it has kept lot of market participants talking more and more about why this is happening, and they are focusing more on the dark blue type and nominal, inflation compensation hasn't changed that much over this period.

years out from now.  I guess the way I'd like to interpret this picture is, testimony last May, and then there has been some MR. BULLARD.  When I look at this picture, you're talking about five-year, five-year forward.  So this is five there was some steady state before the JEC

But this is stuff that thought that the 10-year around 2.75 percent, and we're trying to understand, given rates have been and the fact that the asset purchases are actually going down, why telling MR. POTTER.  The thing that's interesting is, most people would be around 3.25 percent.  It's where short we haven't seen the 10-year move up, and it's interesting that one of the stories people are is that long-run growth will be lower.  They could definitely be wrong on that.

as low as what they thought before the JEC MR. BULLARD.  Lower, but evidently not testimony last May.

premium effect rather than a effect.  If you look at the question we asked about the long-run growth rate on been moving down, and it has been moving down with their estimates of last year or so.  That has same direction. MR. POTTER.  Most of us would think that that was a term real growth rate the dealer survey, it has what the long-run fed funds rate will be, and that's happened over the been going on while we saw between April and July a big repricing of fixed income, when you saw both short and long forwards move in the of 2013? MR. BULLARD.  So you don't want me to just interpret this as some kind of backing off of the peak that was hit in December

a very valid way of interpreting it.  I was just pointing out it's that the 10-year has been quite becalmed around 2.70 percent despite everything that's been going on. MR. POTTER.  That is quite interesting else

As you can see from the top two panels of your to the first quarter.  The in consumption services, while the firstin exports.  I would estimate now is for first-quarter band that surrounds even a forecast in first-quarter real to think that was held down last quarter by several transitory factors, including unusually in exports.  Hence, we continue to a 3½ percent pace this quarter. MR. WASCHER.    Thank you, Madam Chair.  I'll be referring to a one-page handout entitled, 'Material for Forecast Summary.'  The data inflation the way of material surprises, projections forecast summary exhibit, the incoming spending data resulted in an upward revision to fourth-quarter real GDP growth and a downward revision fourth-quarter surprise was concentrated quarter surprise was mostly attributable to an unexpected decline note as an aside that given how low our point growth-and taking account of the sizable error on the eve of release-it would not be particularly unusual from a statistical point of view if tomorrow's advance estimate were to show a small decline GDP.  Despite the downward revision to our Q1 estimate, we continue GDP severe winter weather and the aforementioned decline to anticipate that real GDP growth will step up that we received during the intermeeting with this near-term picture.  In particular, both retail sales vehicle sales picked up sharply in March.  Likewise, after a sharp decline induced, manufacturing production rebounded in And, after the Tealbook was closed, we received advance report on durable goods, which showed increases in orders and shipments modest investment we are projecting this quarter.

fallen short of our expectations is residential indicator of the underlying pace of construction, also surprised us to the last year.  It is possible that depressed starts and permits in the early part of the year to a greater we had anticipated.  Nevertheless, as shown in the middle-left panel, we extent, for the year as a there might be more underlying weakness in the housing sector month-to-month volatility of some of these measures-make to mark down our outlook too drastically at this point.  Moreover, given seems likely that at least some of the slow pace rising input costs as well as anecdotes from builders.  Taking a broader see the fundamentals for the housing sector as favorable, and about that One component of demand that has construction.  Specifically, single-family starts last month were softer than we had projected in the March Tealbook; building permit issuance, which we generally view as a better downside and remains noticeably below the levels seen bad weather degree than took some signal from the incoming data and marked down our forecast for residential investment growth in the first half and, to a lesser whole.  Our view that than we had previously thought was reinforced by the softer-than-expected data on March home sales, though here too our uncertainty regarding the effects of bad weather-and the usual us hesitant the continued rise in house prices, it of sales and construction reflects supply constraints, a hypothesis supported by evidence of view, however, we still thus we continue to project a noticeable acceleration in residential construction as the effects of bad weather unwind, the overall economy improves, and as supply-related constraints gradually diminish.  But we admit to being somewhat nervous projection.

March employment report came in about as pace of job gains for the first whole was in line with our March projection, and we continue to modest rise in job growth over the near term.  On the household side, the rate was 0.2 percentage point higher.  For the near term, we small upward surprise to the unemployment rate but are some of last month's improvement in the participation rate to revisions leave our current assessment of labor market slack is in line with our Turning to the labor market, the expected.  On the establishment side, the average quarter as a anticipate a March unemployment rate was one-tenth higher than we had expected, while the labor force participation have taken on board the inclined to attribute noise.  Combined, these about unrevised, with an employment-to-population ratio that previous forecast.

projection is also little changed from March:  As noted, consistent with our view that the weakness seen in the first mostly transitory, and we made only small and offsetting revisions to our round.  We therefore continue to project that real GDP pick up to an average pace that is just above 3 percent per year as some of growth in recent years-such as federal fiscal rate of potential output growth that is expected to percent over the next few years, this pace of actual output percent at to our previous forecast and leaves at our estimate of its natural rate at the end of the projection Our medium-term GDP the incoming data seem quarter was conditioning factors this growth will the forces that have been restraining policy-start to fade.  With a average a touch below 2 growth implies a steady reduction in the unemployment rate, to just over 5 the end of 2016.  This path is basically identical the unemployment rate period.

bottom two panels of the exhibit summarize the inflation outlook.  As slightly higher March, as is the level of natural gas prices; both of these factors contribute year.  We have also boosted our inflation, as recent increases in crop and livestock appear to be passing through to consumer prices more quickly than we inflation expectations, and core import prices all little revised to March, we made no change to our core inflation forecast; likewise, our In particular, to expect a gradual rise in core inflation over the medium term as some of the transitory that depressed inflation in 2013 are not repeated, and as core import prices to a moderate rate of increase following their decline last year.  Meanwhile, lower than core in 2015 and 2016, slight downward tilt in crude oil prices in our forecast. Finally, the shown on the left, we have marked up headline PCE inflation a little through the middle of this year.  Our near-term path for the price of crude oil is relative to to a bit more consumer energy price inflation this near-term forecast for food price prices anticipated.  In contrast, core inflation (shown on the right) has come in as expected. With projected slack, relative projection for headline inflation is basically unrevised after this year. we continue margins of labor- and product-market slack tighten further, as factors return headline inflation is projected to run a bit reflecting the presentation. Steve will continue our

early this year.  After averaging 3 percent in the second half of last year, I'll discuss shortly, our best guess is that Chinese growth will regain by the second half of this year and maintaining that pace for the remainder MR. KAMIN.  I will not be referring to a handout.  Like many cars driving on Washington roads following our unusually harsh winter, the foreign economy ran into a pothole foreign growth slowed to only 2¼ percent in the first quarter, ½ percentage point below what we wrote down in March.  Much of the slowdown was concentrated in China and its emerging market neighbors, and importantly reflected a drop-off in exports.  As some of its earlier momentum in the next few quarters, while Latin America's economy, which has also languished of late, will pick up too.  Accordingly, we see foreign growth clambering out of the pothole with its hubcaps still on, reaching 3¼ percent of the forecast period.

Bill discussed, the U.S. economy also hit a pothole in the first quarter, contribution of net exports to U.S. GDP swung from positive 1 percentage fourth quarter to an estimated negative 1 percentage point in the first, as rate.  Because the export decline chiefly reflected it as transitory and project exports to current quarter, erasing the drag on U.S. GDP.  By the same export slowdown in the EMEs, which included a step-down in shipments trade and economic activity will also pick up in the EMEs, supporting global Notably, as in part reflecting the same factor restraining many foreign economies:  contracting trade.  The point in the exports plunged at a 5½ percent contracting shipments of oil and agricultural products, which had enjoyed outsized gains the quarter before, we are inclined to view resume growing in the token, the of high-tech goods, also follows a strong fourth quarter.  This gives us some optimism that growth.

the Chinese the pace of expansion dropped from 8 percent in the weakened significantly.  The causes of the slowdown are murky.  Over the so, the authorities had taken actions to rein in credit growth, boost rates, and generally rebalance the economy away from investment and Asian economies, raising questions as to whether some of the reported be due to statistical problems.  All told, our best guess is that at least in the second half of this year as exports sure, China's they are not planning substantial additional if economic growth continues to perform much below their current have also underperformed recently. However, this outlook for renewed global growth is hardly assured, and China represents the biggest question mark.  Based on the GDP data released by authorities, we estimate that fourth quarter to only 5½ percent in the first.  Industrial production, investment, and exports all past year or interest exports, and we were expecting some moderation in growth, but nothing this abrupt. Moreover, China's exports appear to have fallen considerably further than those of most other decline may some of the slowdown was due to transitory factors and Chinese economic growth will move back up to over 7 percent strengthen and domestic policy turns more supportive.  To be authorities have been quite outspoken that stimulus, but they will probably either deliver that stimulus or at least ease off their earlier tightening 7½ percent target.  As Chinese growth recovers, it should support a more rapid expansion in other EMEs, especially in Asia, that together, we considered might be seeing the beginnings of a financial crisis in China, with more generalized disruptions, and to view a significant surge in financial volatility as a downside risk rather mention.  First, the could boost oil prices, depress sentiment, and stresses in EMEs eased further since your last meeting, some EMEs harbor significant vulnerabilities, and a renewal of stresses, perhaps as we banks start to raise rates, remains a possibility. This outlook is reasonably benign, and in putting it whether we shortfalls in activity eventually triggering sharp downdrafts in property and financial markets.  Notwithstanding some isolated corporate defaults and a localized run on a rural bank, however, we've seen scant evidence of we continue than a feature of our baseline outlook.  Two other risks bear situation in Ukraine is deteriorating, and as noted in the Tealbook, a substantial escalation of geopolitical tensions weigh on U.S. and global growth.  Second, as Simon discussed earlier, although financial continue to and other major central

little higher than their in the euro area have been reasonably upbeat, and growth looks set to edge by 2016-on the back of further stresses and fiscal drag.  The Japanese economy will likely result of the hike in consumption taxes on April 1, but some in the advanced foreign economies as broadly the United States, with output close to its potential level, inflation Assuming these risks do not materialize, our outlook for the advanced foreign economies is also reasonably benign, though hardly ebullient, with economic growth averaging 2¼ percent over the forecast period.  This is a estimated potential growth, so resource slack diminishes over time.  Economic indicators up over the forecast period-reaching 2 percent reductions in financial contract this quarter as a offsetting government spending and continued asset purchases should support abovetrend growth, on average, even given a second tax hike scheduled for the end of next year.  Perhaps reflecting some lack of imagination on our part, by the end of the forecast period, we see the situation similar to that in

interest rates still well below their likely approaching the 2 percent target, and policy long-run levels.

across the major central in the first quarter of 2015, even before the staff's projection has FOMC starting to tighten.  At the other end of the spectrum, we see the Bank of in the BOJ's initial announcement of its program last year.  That said, we've comfort with the progress of the fact that both of them have come in weaker than we'd Although continued monetary policy accommodation abroad seems nearly assured, policy rate paths will likely diverge considerably banks.  In the United Kingdom, continued brisk GDP growth along with continued weak productivity pushed the unemployment rate down to 6.9 percent, below the 7 percent threshold announced last August.  The Bank of England is expected to start raising its policy rate the Japan continuing its heavy asset purchases through the end of 2015, a year later than specified abandoned our earlier assumption that the BOJ will substantially step up the pace of its purchases, as BOJ officials have signaled greater inflation and output, despite expected recently.

Although the continued to decline recently, falling to interest in to lowering interest rates, the way to purchases of asset-backed securities or government bonds-depending and to what extent the risks of disinflation become more pronounced. have their drawbacks.  Accordingly, we do not point, that seems unlikely.  Much of the euro area's recent at almost 1 percent.  For the period ahead, we anticipate that a bottoming and narrowing of output gaps will push inflation up to 1½ end of next year, hardly rapid progress, but enough to keep the to start raising rates. Prospects for monetary policy are especially uncertain in the euro area.  The ECB continues economy is now in its fifth quarter of recovery, unemployment remains stuck near 12 percent, and 12-month headline inflation has 0.5 percent in March.  As Simon noted, ECB officials have signaled their various options-ranging from providing further liquidity all on whether However, beyond relatively modest actions such as providing additional LTROs, more-aggressive measures would all see the ECB starting asset purchases unless a significant deterioration of the outlook forces its hand.  At this disinflation has been driven by falling retail energy prices, while core inflation has run higher out of energy prices percent toward the ECB on hold until 2016, when we expect it

In addition, as illustrated in panel 2, the level of triparty repurchase agreements backed by relatively illiquid collateral, the area above the dark blue region, has changed little over the past several quarters.

In this scenario, the effect on the unemployment rate peaks at 0.3 percentage point in 2016 and moderates to about 0.2 percentage point by 2018, while the effect on the level of GDP peaks at 80 basis points and also ebbs a bit through 2018.  In the simulation, households which limits the effects offset.

However, it debt markets could be more disruptive than in the simulation.  For instance, negative returns on high-yield bonds could cause broader primary issuance market as well.  Such an event would be more consequential for the real financial short-term debt relative the possibility that the financial system would become impaired I'll conclude by noting that while financial vulnerabilities remain modest overall, we cannot rule out from a large and adverse shock, such as a resurgence of instability in Europe, or a marked deterioration of the situation in Ukraine.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  That concludes our prepared remarks.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  The floor is open for questions for any of the presenters. CHAIR President Lockhart.

to ask a question about the trends in leveraged lending, and I debt multiples in the transaction valuation?  It's one thing to say that debt multiples are exceeding six a very thin equity layer in the transaction.  It's another thing to say there is it tells you about the equity cushion in the deal. trends, total valuation trends? MR. LOCKHART.  I'd like know something but perhaps not enough about this.  But can you put the context of total times when there's default risk when there's a cushion of 25 to 35 percent equity in the deal.  So the total evened-out multiple of the transaction is relevant because Can you talk about those risky deals, particularly the bottom bar in this chart.  I think-I'm not than I'm hearing. MR. COVITZ.  I don't know the ratios that you're talking about, but my understanding is that these are very, very sure.  Maybe you're hearing something different

April 29-30, 2014

multiples got to around equity slice in the deal was percent.  It's another way of saying leveraged buyout folks were buying companies to the financial crisis, equity in deals went up to 40 percent I have heard is that they remain around 25 percent.  So you have times multiple with 6 times debt.  That leaves quite a the misconstruing the danger debt multiples. MR. LOCKHART.  In the late 1980s, total transaction EBIDTA 11, and with debt exceeding in many cases 9 times or 10, so that the less than 5 almost totally with debt.  In response of the capital structure, and all transactions that are valued at, say, 8 significant amount of equity to burn through before you have a potential default.  That's thrust of my question, and I just want to make sure we're not associated with slightly over 6 times

Lockhart, we can come back to you on the full transaction debt multiples post issuance.  So it's for the whole thing, not the of multiples MS. LIANG.  President multiples, but these are particular transaction.  And then the other piece is that if you look at debt multiples nonfinancial firms in the universe, like the corporate sector, the 75th percentile on debt usually ranges between like 3 and 4.

deals.  And 75th percentile would be 3 or 4 times MR. LOCKHART.  In nonleveraged cash flow in nonleveraged deals.

transactions, but firms.  So if the corporate sector, the 75th percentile has fluctuated over the recent years between, to a higher tail of the distribution.  So it is high. MS. LIANG.  In nonleveraged, just firms-not deals, not you look at say, 3 and 4.  So 6 gets you close guess even though you don't have the ratio you're are thinking not just about MR. COVITZ.  President Lockhart, I looking for, presumably the rating agencies when they rate the deals the amount of debt relative to earnings but also about any equity that's available to burn through for the corporation.  In this case, what we're seeing is the share of the deals rated single-B or

April 29-30, 2014

gone up quite a bit in the past several months.  We're also seeing just a deterioration triple-C has of the ratings distribution as well.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman Dudley.

DUDLEY.  I guess I have two questions.  When you think about stability, do you think about financial stability from the perspective of 'things happen'? the former or both?  That's my first VICE CHAIRMAN financial Financial institutions break, they become impaired, and therefore, credibility in the economy suffers.  Or do you also think about financial stability if you have just big movements in asset prices that tighten financial conditions?  Do you think about question.

from the FRB/US model is not a MR. COVITZ.  I think of it mainly as requiring some sort of dysfunction whether it's institutions or markets.  The simulation that we've presented financial-stability event.

DUDLEY.  It's a financial conditions event. VICE CHAIRMAN

financial-conditions event.  There's no dysfunction, and it's financial-conditions event because it's only affecting one particular MR. COVITZ.  Right.  It's a even a particularly narrow market.  That's one of the reasons why the effects are relatively modest.

DUDLEY.  I guess my reservation is I just hope we don't think that going to break we shouldn't worry about it.  I can imagine a situation in which you movements in financial asset prices with nothing breaking, but it is still actually we want.  It's just my preference. VICE CHAIRMAN if nothing is can have big very hard for us to keep the economy on the trajectory that second question I have relates to Simon's chart that showed the volatility numbers basically where they were late 2006, early 2007, and The for equity, bonds, currency.  They're presumably when you're in a low volatility environment and where we are in the business cycle,

April 29-30, 2014

sort of supports asset valuations that are that I have is what happens if volatility environment?  It's something that you didn't really highlight in inflation is low and the economy is growing, that probably going to be above average.  I guess the question something changes that your briefing per se, but it seems to me like we're living through this incredibly low volatility environment, which I think could change at any point in time.  How do you think about that?

kind of a proxy or metaphor for a volatility shock the in the corporate bond market, but also let that shock to term premiums and spreads feed equity market, and you get something like a 35 percent drop in the equity market just roughly double the effects on the real economy.  Very significant. MR. COVITZ.  One way to think of it is, yes, asset prices would likely respond.  When I think of that simulation that we presented, it was event.  If you wanted a full volatility event that affected all markets, you could think of that as a risk-aversion shock in FRB/US, and I asked the staff to do that for me-not just spreads through the in that simulation.  I think it's

DUDLEY.  I'd love to see something like that at a future briefing. VICE CHAIRMAN Just what happens if there's a big shock to volatility and how does that feed through markets and then into equities.  I just think that would be useful for the Committee.

well to do that.  It's not set up well to MR. COVITZ.  Yes, and I think FRB/US is set up think about things breaking.

Okay.  Thank you. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

YELLEN.  President Lacker. CHAIR

was curious about it as well.  Your answer used the word 'dysfunction.' think of that as an economic term.  How do you define dysfunction? MR. LACKER.  I'll follow up on Vice Chairman Dudley's first question.  I was glad he was asking it because I I don't

I think I had this conversation with you before, right and we were probably at the same MR. COVITZ.  The inability to taking, in which markets no longer are just saying, 'I want when the asset-backed commercial paper market fell apart, place.  [Laughter]

Déjà vu all over again. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

not a terribly crisp point. MR. LACKER.  The obvious observation is that it's

DUDLEY.  I think you and I've had this conversation.  [Laughter] may have been seven years ago-was the But I fine. VICE CHAIRMAN MR. COVITZ.  I think the answer I gave you-it something like, I don't view it as anyone being irrational.  And some of the movements we saw in commercial paper spreads and the reaction of investors in the commercial paper market in financial crisis were not necessarily irrational.  That's not the way I was describing it. would describe what happened in the asset-backed commercial paper market as dysfunction, because it was wholesale, widespread pulling back, even if the assets being funded were probably just doing great work to help that could happen, and, for my money, I think it would be useful for us to good staff with thinking resources into this question.  What should an intervention and what shouldn't?  I think that your folks' research on the asset-backed paper market developments of August 2007 was extremely useful and valuable.  It's, interpretations. MR. LACKER.  No, this is a serious question.  You folks are prepare us for things also invest some of our warrant commercial as you acknowledge in your paper, open to alternative

is a word, and I always ask you about it because it carries this connotation of medical intervention.  If you're sick, you need to go to a doctor, right?. that investors were discriminating on the basis of public mortgageAnd your paper has been cited as evidence that, indeed, the asset-backed paper market was functioning pretty well, even though the function it was that they didn't deserve credit. MR. LACKER.  'Dysfunction' with it Yet your paper provided evidence information about the degree to which various portfolios were exposed to subprime backed risk. commercial performing was to inform some issuers of paper remind you again should you slip [laughter]. We'll find another, neutral word. MR. COVITZ.  I take your point.  It's a loaded word. MR. LACKER.  I'll VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Fisher.

Chair.  I have just a couple of points.  I do think it is that, after talking about all of these various risks that seem to be building in a lot, and I'm deeply concerned about it-it's not enough to I do think it would be helpful to go back the model.  We had a correction in 1962 that had almost no effect whatsoever is worth exploring. MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Madam helpful to consider the marketplace-I speak about this point it out.  The question is, might it have an impact? and study or adjust on economic growth.  There have been others-in 1987.  So I think that before, and it's a very a low spread over an extremely low historical nominal yield.  And if you're an investor in that's what you care about-in other words, the payback tension in the marketplace.  Just to talk about the spreads is It's noteworthy, but it's insufficient. I'll make a couple of comments.  First-I've mentioned this important point-when you talk about low spreads on triple-C or junk credit, bear in mind that it's those instruments, as I used to be, feature.  I think that adds extra insufficient.

April 29-30, 2014

more about this than I do-basically, oneit to work within a two-year time frame, or else your clients are going to ask for it indicates to me that we could have an extension, but there are certain things that estate now and some of the seeing more merger activity because of what is now known as the look rather after each other.  So I think we just need to bear that in of a Second, with regard to your comment on panel 10 and leveraged loans, the way the private equity groups work-and, again, you know fourth of their dry powder now has been erased in the past year.  Typically, the mindset is, you have to put back.  Now, that they seem to be shying away from-for example, commercial real buyout activity.  You're 'Botoxification' of balance sheets.  They've taken the wrinkles out.  They all artificially pretty, and they're going mind.  There's a time frame here in which money has to be put to work-that's the mentality private equity group.

international side, the one thing you didn't mention was Spain, two is, if you fly first class from London to Madrid, there is the is the Carlyle section of the airplane. now viewed as the the offshoring.  As a production center, Europe in the United may be a negative thing, but I risk.  Or maybe it represents no risk whatsoever, but I just want you to broaden your a little bit here.  That's my suggestion, respectfully made. And then getting to the and the reason I am linking the Oaktree section, there is the Blackstone section, and there Five-year Spanish credit trades through the United States.  And Spain is onshoring of what was occurring in Morocco as has had a quick turn.  A lot of this private equity money is now looking not just States, but also elsewhere.  That may be a positive thing, or it think we need to start looking at that as well in terms of whether or not this indicates some potential perspective

MR. COVITZ.  I agree.  The $600 billion worth of dry powder in the private equity industry is definitely something to pay attention to.

April 29-30, 2014

significant, if not a window.  But it comes back to the issue mentioned Does it Should we touch that tool or not?  When do we touch that tool?  We touched it in a jillion years.  These are the kinds of things I would like to see developed marketplace.  It's unnatural. in a CFO's or a dealmaker's pocket just as it does in anybody else's, and are to the real MR. FISHER.  It could extend this period of what I consider hypervaluation.  So we may still have quite before by both Vice Chairman Dudley and President Lacker.  What do we do about it? matter, or does it not matter?  You mentioned margin requirements.  We do have the power to move that.  Should we? haven't over time.  I am concerned, personally, about excesses in the Money burns a hole we're seeing some holes being burned in pockets.  I want to know what the risks economy and, by extension, to our mandate.  That would be helpful.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Powell.

MS. LIANG.  May I comment on that?

CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes, please.

in train.  Maybe it's taking longer than we would like, but that is in place.  SNC months.  Banks may well be fixing their own as long as investor demand is strong, and year's stress so that firms were expected to think through whether, if their leveraged loans were to go the stress tests again-it's almost a year-round event.  We're starting to think through able to slow you can make your banks stronger in case this happens. MS. LIANG.  As you know, as the Federal Reserve has issued guidance on leveraged lending; it's exams will be coming along in the next couple of processes, and it's not going to slow down the market therefore, we may want to be thinking about it.  We did actually included this in last tests bad, they would have adequate capital for that.  We obviously can do that again.  I believe we're starting up that.  There's the thought of a countercyclical capital buffer.  Again, you may not be it down, but

April 29-30, 2014

couple of words on margin.  Some of the margin credit for equities is old it is these new portfolio-margining debits, which are not in our authority. We have not changed it since it's very easy to circumvent with derivatives-that it wasn't useful. are something for which the SEC or FINRA has the authority. We have raised the issue of raised this broad issue.  These are policies that we have been thinking about but just have I'll say a Regulation T.  Some of Regulation T, the 50 percent on equity loans, is our authority. 1977.  We've had a view that The portfolio-margining debits Certainly, it's something we could raise in the public discussions. small-cap stocks.  Because we generally don't think the broad market equities look that rich, we haven't not put in the public discussion.

to beat this horse to death, but it also shows the much broader than the depository from the nondepository side, how might it put at risk MR. FISHER.  Again, I don't want limitations of our franchise, because the credit system is institutions.  So we do what we can with the depository institutions, but the question is, if you have disruption and infection that comes what we try to do?

MS. LIANG.  Absolutely.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Powell.

talking about private equity, I do keep in reasonably going on out there.  I would say that prices are high, leverage is high, cases, not as bad as it was in 2007.  Prices might be in the mid-9s.  We that expected returns now are very low You're looking at returns in the mid-teens with all of this leverage, and size of the equity contribution as well.  The other really important MR. POWELL.  As long as we're close touch with what's and equity is low-in all talked about leverage.  Equity contributions are in the low 20s.  So, again, not as bad as in 2007, but, in all cases, it's getting stretched.  The difference is by historical standards. that puts pressure on the

April 29-30, 2014

rates are incredibly low.  They swap out a lot of the floating-rate debt anyway low rates.  You put all of this into the mix-I'm not at all sure that there's a big wave of ratios are pretty good.  Certainly, the equity But there are no covenants.  It's going to be really hard to a mixed picture to me. difference is that at very defaults being cooked up here because coverage returns are under a lot of threat. default or fail to pay.  So, again, it's

MR. LACKER.  No dysfunction to worry about.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota.

Chair.  I'm looking at exhibit 3, I want to get back to this question of, what do we do Some of us have talked about the need to tighten policy as a way to mitigate risks.  Vice Chairman Dudley has parsed this more finely than I have, between financial events, but this seems like a financial conditions event that is actually the prescription for this particular illness? MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes.  Thank you, Madam 'Liftoff Tantrum Simulation,' and I guess about this? potential stability and financial being caused by the prospect of tightening.  What's is caused by the prospect of tightening.  And then there monetary policy, which, I believe, is to push liftoff back one the panic has already happened.  It's your choice-you could overshoot in the other to offset it, but, again, these effects aren't that big.  If you believe the prescriptions of Taylor rule, you should just push liftoff back one quarter. MR. COVITZ.  You're right.  It is an endogenous response of quarter, but direction the inertial

the That's a separate risk? MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Right.  I guess my question was, if we're thinking about amplification of this risk that's described in the fourth bullet-or is that not an amplification of these first three bullets?

April 29-30, 2014

the model and asking whether the shock in its effects than the FRB/US simulation is telling us.  And I think the MR. COVITZ.  It's separate.  It's going outside could actually be bigger answer has to be 'yes.'

adverse event, there, or do we just wait, have the shock materialize, and deal MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  So, confronted with this possibility of a large what ex ante policy prescription is with it ex post?

tough, because if you don't precipitate the shock, then vulnerability MR. COVITZ.  It's could build and then the shock is ultimately bigger.

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thanks.

amplification tough part.  Part of this is to corporate bond investors that are over a horizon of the next two, which could amplify this.  Our model suggests that high debt growth and big junk to reduce the risky debt growth, and that is a little bit of what is behind our thinking. MS. LIANG.  If I could add to that, this last bullet point, which is the beyond the term premiums and pulling forward by investors, is the thinking about negative returns year or shares are predictors of negative excess returns.  So our strategy has been that we should be trying That's one possibility.

Dudley's and President Lacker's the system and a lot of maturity transformation is in the system.  To the that we can be tracking leverage so we can take actions to reduce leverage, the result it doesn't force actions of different investors and institutions, and we limit the effects.  So we are thinking Another part of this-and this gets to Vice Chairman comments-is what I would call negative externalities.  Maybe I'll use those words instead of 'dysfunction.'  It might survive.  I'm not sure.  [Laughter]  But those are often generated when a lot of leverage is in extent should be that when there is a price decline, it doesn't force fire sales and on the parts

April 29-30, 2014

system and the short-term funding in the system.  Those are two other about leverage in the channels to consider.

Chair, can I follow up?  As a regulator, I think the that President Lacker was discussing with Dan and with you are really challenging think the issues are a little bit simpler because we have our to 2 percent and unemployment low. mapping potential problems in the financial sector into risks to those more complicated.  Sometimes it seems as though the right the lens of a monetary policymaker, we can get away from to our goals and how you MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Madam questions ones.  As a monetary policymaker, I goals identified for us, which are to keep inflation close We'd want to have ways of goals-and then treatments for those risks, either ex post or ex ante. Ex post is hard, but we know what to do.  Ex ante, I think, is treatment is to raise rates, and sometimes it seems as though the right treatment is to lower rates. So if you start to filter this through the loaded words like 'dysfunction,' et cetera .  It's just about risks respond to those risks to our goals.

could follow up on that, I think that's a good point. they've got a housing expansion in market participants' in the housing mortgage market.  As a central bank, what It's a genuine dilemma. MR. LACKER.  Madam Chair?  If I Sweden is going through a major dilemma on this because train-I'm not saying 'boom.'  It's arguably an expansion conditioned by beliefs about bailouts due to what happened in the early 1990s and the precedent set there.  So, arguably, risk-taking is going too far do you do?

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Rosengren.

recessions occur roughly once every does seem as though we don't get to the tail of the distribution using our models.  As MR. ROSENGREN.  A quick observation is that, when you look at our scenarios, they almost never generate negative GDP.  And, given that 10 years, it

April 29-30, 2014

most severe of the scenarios that you have here, 'Escalating the unemployment rate in Europe is kind of unemployment what kind of inflation story do you have?  The way I could imagine a scenario that gives negative outcome is, if that unemployment rate gets pretty high and if you have a it really plausible that we get only as mild an outcome an example of that, thinking of the Geopolitical Tensions,' I was curious-you mentioned that just under 12 percent.  They're worried about deflation.  In Europe, what rate and you a more deflationary economy in Europe, is globally, including in the United States?

the sense that GDP falls 2¼ percent below baseline.  So, avoid that negative GDP that you just north of the zero line but, for the advanced them into negative territory.  And, although we don't have it the rest of the world experiences-declines in natural gas exports.  Basically, this event puts Europe back into a moderately by.  On the other hand, taking into the large confidence intervals around these-it's based on science, but, nevertheless, you in the United States. MR. KAMIN.  I should mention that for the United States, in this particular scenario, the outcome is 'moderately' benign in given that we're projecting somewhat higher growth, we just referred to.  But that's not true for the other parts of the global economy.  Not to put too fine a point on it, the rest of the world's economy falls around 4 percent relative to their baseline, which, for the EMEs, puts them, again, perhaps foreign economies, actually puts broken down per se, that's mainly going to be concentrated in Europe, in part because not only does Europe suffer the usual downdrafts that sentiment, increases in financial stresses, and the higher oil prices-but it also gets the effect of Russia cutting off deep recession.  But, again, the United States-we just skate account could imagine a situation in which this generates, indeed, a recession

CHAIR YELLEN.  President George.

April 29-30, 2014

taking longer than we expected, we think that after the SNCs, we'll have a better sense of that. MS. GEORGE.  My question, I think, was answered by Nellie.  It was on how our supervisory guidance is affecting leveraged lending.  So, it's maybe, but

YELLEN.  Thanks.  Well, now we've had a round of questions on the briefings. to comment on financial-stability concerns-not a CHAIR We also have an opportunity for individuals full go-round by any means.  But if there are people who would like to do that, please just indicate it.  President Rosengren.

leveraged had the tantrum in financial markets, so, according to the 10-year rate, the rates went was saying about the Swedish example.  As we think of the ability of to be slowed down, either with monetary policy or with supervisory policy, at meeting when we have the time-to think a little us have been giving speeches about financial stability.  If scenarios, what kinds of tradeoffs be, and what would be the magnitudes, between using primarily interest rates to try MR. ROSENGREN.  I have a quick comment.  I found the discussion of the lending market very interesting, particularly when I think of the scenario that was occurring last spring.  We up very appreciably.  We had a bunch of supervisory interventions with the intent of slowing down that market.  As was noted in Dan's briefing, the result was that we actually had more leveraged lending occurring.  And so I think it's an interesting observation, which is similar to what President Lacker exuberant markets least if you look at that spring as an example, it indicates that relatively large movements in both supervisory policy and monetary policy didn't do much then.  It might be interesting-not today, obviously, being so late, but at a future FOMC bit more about this, because some of we were in a Swedish example or one of these other kinds of would there to slow down a section of the economy?  Alternatively, what are our options for supervisory and

this kind of exuberance regulatory policy, and do we have sufficient tools to actually address with what we have now?

YELLEN.  Thanks.  Would others like to comment?  President Bullard. CHAIR

in in Hong Kong.  They've a sobering example of what you just talked about in which they have the power still go up.  So it's very sobering. MR. BULLARD.  To follow up on President Rosengren's comment, I was recently Hong Kong, and practically all anyone talked about was housing prices tried a lot of things-monetary policy and nonmonetary policy things-to try to stem what looks like a very exuberant housing market in Hong Kong, and it's not clear that they're having very much effect.  It is to do other things, they are aware of the problem, and they are trying to do a whole bunch of things, but prices

getting ahead of themselves and maybe expansion going too it, emerges and the extent to which we'd get involved programmatically to insulate imply something about our willingness to backstop private markets that we MR. LACKER.  I have one final thought.  And it's to separate concern about what we've been discussing-some markets are rapidly in some areas-from the question of what we would do if dysfunction, or whatever we want to call some creditors from the consequences.  We all have different views about that, but I think it's a separate question from having to take on board the macroeconomic issues.  We want to do that in a way that doesn't don't intend to convey.  Thank you.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Evans.

MR. EVANS.  On President Bullard's comment, I want to say that Hong Kong is a very interesting case, but, of course, they're importing U.S. monetary policy because they're pegging to the U.S. dollar.  It's wholly inappropriate for their own economy, I would say.  So they have

April 29-30, 2014

tools, like increasing equity in housing and whatnot.  That's a to do all of these macroprudential big challenge.

We have about 25 minutes before we have to break for dinner. may not be able to get too far, but I think that, in the old days, we actually used to meetings and do everything in a day, so I think we'll have plenty of time tomorrow begin the economic go-round and start with President Williams? CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay. So I suggest we begin our economic go-round.  We we'll have plenty of time tomorrow.  You may recall have one-day to finish.  Why don't we so much about and the accompanying the Tealbook, I have not materially changed last meeting.  In fact, in the the forecast lines for March and April MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The ongoing recovery appears to be back on track, with the severe winter weather that was talked hiccup in economic growth now behind us.

[Laughter]  And manufacturing is very bullish about remodeling and homebuilding In March, consumer and business spending posted solid gains, and my business contacts are generally optimistic about the rest of the year.  Even in real estate, which hasn't yet rebounded from the winter slump, the mood in my part of the member of our Economic Advisory Council says the San Francisco real strongest he's seen in his entire life.  Now, right after he said that, another member of the council asked, 'But a contact in door and window nationwide.

I will spend the rest of my time-I'll just spend the afternoon [laughter]-discussing why the muted wage growth we've with a strengthening target, broad measures of nominal benefits-should be rising about 3½ to 4 percent per year to short of that pace, with most measures centering that hints at a desirable acceleration well below normal levels.  Now, the slow limited pressures to boost in a few selected hot markets.  And they expect wage increases to remain In a healthy economy, with inflation near our compensation-wages, salaries, and keep up with inflation and productivity growth.  In contrast, for the past three years, we've seen an increase in compensation that has fallen well around 2 percent.  Average hourly earnings is one indicator in wages.  Even there, the rate of increase is still recovery in wages is confirmed by my contacts.  They report compensation, except modest in the coming year.

the muted pace of wage growth?  Namely, is it a sign that the market may have been more modest than these other indicators looked into this question and found that the current pattern of relatively weak early and middle parts of a recovery is not actually unique.  In fact, the in the early 1990s and early 2000s displayed a similar pattern, in which wages lagged as in the current we might think.  In particular, they find that How should we interpret improvement in the labor suggest?  My staff wage growth during the recoveries the cycle.  In those episodes, unemployment gaps, though never as large episode, narrowed significantly before the pace of wage increases picked up from low levels.  To explain why a pickup in wage growth lags a strengthening labor market, research by my staff emphasizes that wages don't adjust as quickly as

April 29-30, 2014

until the recovery is pretty well advanced. nominal wage cuts are very rare.  This downward nominal wage rigidity turns out to imply that wage growth remains low due to the very high share of reported that they earned the same wage as they had earned a year earlier.  Early in the essentially unchanged wages reached the highest level since The constraint on wage cuts was particularly binding after the Great Recession, severity of the economic shocks, along with low inflation.  As a result, a workers recovery, the share of workers with the day the series began in 1980, nearing 17 percent in 2011.  That compares with about 11 percent in 2007.  This pattern of a rising share of workers with unchanged wages was also seen in the recoveries of the early 1990s and 2000s.

response to recessionary shocks.  In their DSGE model, many workers wage cuts in a downturn but do not, because of the zero lower bound on wage growth falls by less during the recession than it would and, as a result, once the economy starts to recover, a stock-up of pent-up wage cuts to normal.  This occurs only that muted wage growth, both in this model and based on historical experience, is an improving labor market in a low-inflation environment.  In the model, we get closer to full employment.  Again, this periods in which Earlier studies-including those by James Tobin, George Akerlof, and othershighlighted the importance of downward nominal wage rigidities.  My staff extended this research to study the should see adjustments.  That means that wage otherwise, needs to be overcome before the pace of wage increases can return slowly as inflation and productivity growth bring real wages back into balance.  The key takeaway is entirely consistent with wage growth lags the cycle and picks up only as theoretical result matches what we saw in the 1990s and 2000s, two other downward nominal wage rigidity appeared to be binding for many workers.

The first quarter looks disappointment, with real GDP growing close at the time of the December FOMC meeting.  Despite the setback, the economy does again seem poised to grow above potential over the course of this year.  My own forecast growth over forecast.

the forecast is the path of the labor force participation rate. much of the other half of age cohorts, including market conditions improve further. One of the key issues in About half of the decline in labor force participation since the onset of the Great Recession is a result of an aging population.  There is an ongoing debate about how the decline-which reflects declines in participation rates within specific prime-age working cohorts-is bound to be reversed as labor longitudinal data on individuals' work history.  These data can be used to the behavior of individuals who drop out of the labor force during stressful economic they've later been successful reentering the labor force.  The study recessions and recoveries who had of the individuals between the ages of 25 and 44 who left the labor force Work done by the Boston staff has looked at the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, or PSID, which provides analyze times-in particular, whether pooled individuals not in the labor force during the previous previously worked to try to better understand the extent of reentry by age group.  The results indicate that 78 percent

This drops to 40 percent for individuals in the 45-to-54 age cohort who exit the economic stress.  This who historically workforce.  Note that than the historical average.  However, during periods of tight 1990s, the data show significant by retiring. markets tighten, as past experience suggests that a substantial force participation within age-specific cohorts during a recession and the early stages of a recovery is temporary.

With PCE experiencing unusually low inflation rates, we should be particularly attentive incoming data are consistent with our inflation forecast.  Low inflation and unusually low compensation growth give us the flexibility to try to more quickly normalize labor markets. Thank you, Madam Chair.

I have asked our analysts our unemployment rate the rate is about 100 basis points more.  It of employable workers-has grown 10.3 percent since October 2008.  So, even though our unemployment rate is high for us, it's not North Dakota or Minnesota.

And, of course, as we've talked about in almost every District that is experiencing growth, there is a mismatch of skills.  It the IT sector and engineering down to the truck drivers.  In that sense, we're not just growing at a strong pace.

Just to comment very quickly on my interlocutors, I talked previously about what I call the growth muscle.  I am beginning to detect a shift across I've talked to around the country-big and small as well as public and private.  The shift is toward changing the mentality of their management to think about growth and not just be in a defensive crouch and worry about containment during this comment on Ukraine.

If you almost six years, they're actually seeing an increase in activity.  They have been reporting small business activity in seen that in the reports from the small business reporting groups.  But you're beginning to see a shift now with large enterprise as well.  I do think that a occur.

research report on We've often discussed whether the unemployment rate is a reliable measure of a lot of in the rate at which they transition to employment.  The essentially a weighted average of everybody who's not employed full time, but the are pretty Here's an interesting observation:  The short-term unemployed, those unemployed probability of transitioning to full-time employment.  It's long-term unemployed, the probability of transitioning to full-time work is I'll join my colleagues from the 1st and 12th Districts by providing a labor markets. resource underutilization.  I want to talk about-this is something I mentioned last time-a generalized index of labor underutilization that our folks have constructed.  The project starts from the premise that there's substantial underutilization beyond what's captured in the standard unemployment rate.  That's motivated by the significant flows you see from out of the labor force directly to employment rather than spending time in unemployment.  There are differences across nonemployed workers index is weights have to do with the rate of transition to full-time work.  And the differences significant. less than 26 weeks, have the highest about 0.3.  For the roughly half that-about 0.15.

feature of the data is that workers who are classified as out of the labor force past the short-term true whether they've searched in the past year or not, and it's true whether traditional The striking by the BLS, meaning that they do not report having engaged in active search activities in the four weeks but say they want a job, have virtually the same probability of transitioning to fulltime employment as the long-term unemployed.  It's about half the rate of unemployed.  That's they say they're discouraged by economic conditions or not.  This suggests that the

labor force.  Holding aside the retirees and the you don't want a job and you're not in those about one-fourth of the rate of the short-term unemployed. distinction between discouraged workers who want a job and workers who aren't discouraged but say they want a job isn't as economically meaningful, in my opinion.  Workers who tell the BLS they do not want a job have a markedly lower transition rate, as you'd expect, but, nonetheless, some of them just pop into the disabled, who have really low transition rates, if groups, it's time, what my researchers did, which was to take the weighted sum of the different the sample average of the employment probability relative the unemployment rate, rising in recessions and nonemployment index since 2009. The relative size of these employment probabilities seems pretty consistent over and that motivates nonemployed groups.  The weight is to the sample average employment probability of the short-term unemployed.  So the short-term unemployed get a weight of 1, and everyone else gets weights of less than 1.  As you'd expect, the resulting index behaves very much like falling in expansions.  But it's somewhat smoother and more persistent than the unemployment rate.  The unemployment rate has fallen more rapidly than the

that always happens in recoveries.  And it turns out that both which we have data.  Plus, if you it is now, if you understand what I'm about the same level as they were in past expansions.  They a version that takes into account part-time employment, although there are some they're still wrestling with.  So, yes, there's substantial underutilization in the It turns out, though, that rates of decline seem consistent with the past recoveries for line up the level of any one nonemployment index-they have four or five versions-it's about where it was when the unemployment rate last got to where saying.  So in the previous expansion, when did the unemployment rate get to where it is now? Well, the nonemployment index is about where it was then.  Relative to the unemployment rate, these nonemployment indexes are at even have nuances there that

April 29-30, 2014

captured in the standard unemployment rate, but, at least according labor market, beyond what is to these measures, no more than is usually associated with this level of unemployment.

DUDLEY.  Can I ask a question?   How does this weigh into the distinction?  You seem to be saying that the pretty good summary statistic.  So, by inference, you'd then be saying this distinction between short-term and long-term unemployed doesn't have a lot of value.

Thank you, Madam Chair.  We received several data releases reading than the 0.7 percent increase we surprise relative to our forecast was than our forecast of a sales, consumer spending rose 3 percent.  That was fixed for a 2 percent increase. investment fell 5.7 percent, and we had projected a 2 percent decline-so in residential investment than we'd projected.  As expected, exports export numbers are pretty close to what Steve had reported MR. WASCHER. 5 this morning, and I'll start with the BEA's advance estimate of first-quarter GDP growth.  According to that estimate, real GDP edged up one-tenth of 1 percent in the first quarter.  That was a somewhat weaker had projected in the Tealbook.  A good bit of the in inventories, which subtracted 0.6 percentage point from GDP growth last quarter. Final sales rose 0.7 percent.  That was a touch weaker 0.9 percent increase.  Within final about ½ percentage point more than we'd forecast.  In contrast, business investment fell about 2 percent.  That was versus our forecast Residential a bigger decline fell sharply and net exports subtracted nearly 1 percentage point from GDP growth in the first quarter.  The net yesterday.

a lot of the miss was in inventories, I don't think we would take much signal trajectory of GDP over the rest of the year.  In fact, given that the next few quarters.  So I think that at this point, we write down something for GDP growth in the neighborhood of 3½ percent over Given that from this report for the level of inventory investment was so low in the first quarter, we would probably be inclined to forecast it to step back up over the would still the rest of the year.

the core PCE index was up 1.3 percent, and both There weren't any material surprises in the price data.  Total PCE prices rose 1.4 percent in the first quarter, while of those were very close to what we were expecting.

2½ percent costs over the year ending in March were Regarding other releases, the BLS published the employment cost index this morning.  Total compensation for private-industry workers rose at an annual rate of just 1 percent in the first quarter.  That was well below our forecast for a increase.  Increases in both wages and benefits came in lower than we'd expected. On a 12-month change basis, compensation up 1.7 percent; we had about a 2 percent increase over that 12-month period in the Tealbook.

As I've mentioned before, wage pressures have remained subdued is that, although the labor force time for economic reasons.  So, even though the unemployment rate has fallen labor force that's working part time for economic reasons standards. wage growth-President Williams's remarks yesterday conversations with our labor contacts themselves-nothing prompted it.  Employers downturn, so they're waiting before one possible reason why unemployment rate is close to historical norms in the District, a large fraction of the is working part below 5 percent, the fraction of the remains quite high by historical may recall, a few meetings ago, I described Phillips-curve estimates obtained by Minneapolis Fed staff.

I see these cross-MSA estimates as being about the true relationship between national unemployment and national Phillips curve estimates.  Why do I say that?  Aggregate Phillips-curve endogenous response of monetary policy to demand shocks. Now, I should emphasize the following point: more informative inflation than aggregate estimates are contaminated by the

I'm not very disturbed by that, though, given the March data set shows a rebound in production and retail sales and the apparent steady is some residual uncertainty.  We're clearly going to bounce in the second quarter, level?  And then what's the underlying trend after the bounce?  It's going to take a time to get that.

There's a great deal of skepticism just because of Finally, I have a few thoughts on the recent debate about what drives compensation trends-short-term unemployment versus long-term unemployment.  I've read a bunch of the papers, and where I come out is described by five points.  First of all, one skeptical about the econometric results when you have two variables that are so collinear, and so it's very sensitive to the collinearity.

April 29-30, 2014

out to be long-term unemployed.  I think are two possibilities.  One is, you're long-term unemployed because you don't have the job skills.  This is a case of mismatch.  That's very different from the other reason lack of labor demand.  So you're long-term unemployed not because you the right skills, but just because there's a lack of labor demand for you.  In the first not very attached to the labor market, but in the second case, you're just unlucky. Second, I think it does depend on why one turns there appropriate why you might be long-term unemployed:  You might have lost your job during the deep recession, and there's a don't have case, you're You're long-term unemployed due to bad timing.  In the current situation, I would expect that a greater proportion of those who are currently long-term unemployed are in the unlucky category as opposed to not having the appropriate skills.

that the impact of the long-term unemployed on wages presumably whether there's an excess supply of short-term unemployed or not.  If there are get the opportunities first, because we see that more relevant in terms of labor market supply.  So their impact on the labor market market tightens.  I don't think it's quite as static as some of A third observation is depends on plenty of short-term unemployed, I think they'll there's a clear bias against people who are long-term unemployed.  As long as there are plenty of short-term unemployed, this will show up as the long-term unemployed being relatively unattached.  But once the pool of short-term unemployed is depleted, the long-term unemployed will become and wages will increase as the labor these reports suggest.

I don't think this is black or white.  I can't believe that, if that point; I think it's probably a you become more Fourth, as is generally the case, you're unemployed beyond 26 weeks, something happens at gradient.  And I'm pretty comfortable with the idea that, on average, as

So you has assumed greater significance than, in fact, it Chair. Fifth, it seems obvious to me that labor demand is weak, completely apart from this debate.  Some people are acting as though this is the way to weak.  And, if you look at the employment, that's well could set this whole story aside, and you would still reach the conclusion that labor market demand is quite weak.  I think this whole debate probably deserves.  Thank you, Madam

Actually, these comments, I think, will complement what recall, I've should be pretty cautious about drawing too strong a conclusion with labor market problems based on expectations or extrapolations from past different set of circumstances from even the serious recessions of the persistence of high levels of long-term to be skeptical of arguments such as the one asserting that the detachment of the longBeveridge curve shifts long-term more than a short-term One difference is that in past postwar recessions, we had neither the longof high numbers of long-term unemployed.  So the looping Like many of you-most recently, Bill-I want issues Vice Chairman Dudley and President Kocherlakota have been saying.  As people will been suggesting that we respect to current trends.  We have a very post-World War II period-most notably, in the unemployment.  Historically, of course, national rates of short-term unemployment and longterm unemployment pretty much move together, and that has not been the case here.  So I continue term unemployed from the labor market based on the observation that the seem to have been driven by long-term unemployment.

Similarly, it seems a little questionable to unemployment and inflation rates declined significantly and the Phillips curve appeared to flatten.  That's why I've thought that we can't about what's going to be happening in current circumstances.  So I've suggested be practical

April 29-30, 2014

labor market, for reasons many think-and we already heard some examples of atypical circumstance of high a pretty strong correlation between the long-term unemployed and the part-time the past five years or so. Now, since the last meeting, not much has changed in the of you have already stated.  What has changed, I it yesterday afternoon and this morning-is that we're starting to get some empirical work specifically investigating the question of whether the long-term unemployed constitute an important element of labor market slack in the current, historically levels for an extended period.  And I'd just add in passing that I think President Kocherlakota's focus on the part-time employed for economic reasons probably complements this, because there's been employed for economic reasons over have begun to look at state or metropolitan-area data, thereby sets with varying levels of unemployment and external.  First, Michael Kiley's working paper 'An Evaluation of the Pressure Associated with Short- and Long-term Unemployment' examines the A number of researchers moving from a single data set to dozens of data wage movement.  There are at least three examples of this work that I wanted to mention-two from the Board and one Inflationary historical, cross-city, over-time relationships between CPI inflation and both short- and longterm unemployment rates.  And he found that both rates exerted equal pressure on prices.

April 29-30, 2014

Hooper and his colleagues in the research department Bank have found a negative relationship between long-term unemployment rates and in which short-term unemployment has declined to something close to states in which a short-term unemployment gap remains.  This contrast suggests, the pool of short-term unemployed has become by the Board's staff workforce employed time for economic reasons and the share of marginally attached or discouraged workers, levels as a state short-term unemployment rate normalizes.  I do in this room can attest, subject to debate. Third, looking at current data, Peter at Deutsche wage growth in states normal levels.  This is consistent with the intuition that Bill was expressing a minute ago.  An interesting point about this research is that Hooper and his coauthors do not find such a relationship in again, the intuition Bill just stated-that employers as a group will not move to hire the longterm unemployed in large numbers until somewhat depleted.  The Hooper finding is also congruent with analysis showing that multiple measures of labor slack, including the share of the part move toward their pre-recession want to note in passing that the Hooper finding depends on estimates of unemployment gaps, which are, as everyone issue of how much labor there's been labor market damage.  But I do think they provide some empirical support for the to affect labor market conditions, and that there So these lines of research are obviously not conclusive on the market slack remains, and there's nothing in them to contradict my intuition that some structural position that the long-term unemployed continue remains considerable labor market slack that could be reduced through higher levels of aggregate demand.

I think it will be interesting to keep an eye on that. One market.  Here, the interesting set of facts to be reconciled characterize the data on being weaker than expected, so quantity measures look soft.  At the same time, price measures look stronger.  The Tealbook, I think, characterizes CoreLogic and Case-Shiller as actually being a little bit stronger than expected.  It's interesting to try to make sense of that.  The natural inference to supply as opposed to demand.  President Lockhart mentioned a few of the specific factors, and I think that feels reasonably compelling and worth thinking about.  At the same time, it's also good to remember that these price indexes are 'baked up,' and they tend to have a bit in them.  So, what the quantity data prices yet other thing-and this is an oddball thing-is that I saw this article in the week on the market for catastrophe bonds.  If you don't know what catastrophe money back is one, then it's like a default on your bonds-you lose your principal. which was the about this The Wall Street Journal last bonds are, basically, you give your money over, and if no bad disaster happens-no tornado, hurricane, or earthquake-then a year later or three years later, you get all of your with interest.

I think we need consumption to continue to advance or residential investment.  I expect them to increase but not to gradually wane, but there is no upside case lurking anywhere.  Net exports seem likely to continue to be roughly neutral overall and, in the base case are in the high 2s, maybe 3 percent, for now. MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I'll outlook has With good intermeeting readings on retail sales, manufacturing, and consumer confidence, I see economic growth rebounding to a for the year, to feel pretty close at a decent clip just to produce overall economic growth in the high 2s.  Nothing that I see points to a sudden acceleration of business sharply.  Fiscal headwinds are going to continue there the meantime, a highly volatile contributor, as we've seen in the past few quarters.  So I guess I feel as though the upside case and laid of weak activity and prices going up a lot, which does, of there are somehow supply constraints.  I confess that longer-term find the price trend somewhat troubling, as it in the face of weak demand. Housing has become a significant disappointment.  Governor Stein and others have out the basic narrative of longer-term expectations of a return to normal levels of household formation, but, in the short-term, course, suggest-and it makes sense-that I find this still puzzling and somewhat unsatisfying.  And I worry that there are other trends associated with poor job opportunities for younger people and lack of credit availability for weaker households.  I guess I would say that I is continuing

First, is the labor market continuing to improve, and does that be sustainable?  And, second, is it reasonable objective over time?  Of how close we have come to our maximum-employment goal.  A final policy-relevant question is, what factors could materially alter our forecast of a gradual return of employment and inflation

That said, almost all of you noted that there's been very little shift in your forecasts, and I interpret them as generally report number of you commented on-are consistent with a diminished risk on employment and spending early this year of you-Presidents Fisher, Lockhart, and Plosser as well as others-commented on seeing firms somewhat more growth-oriented and on improved business optimism.

the time of the February running around 130,000.  And, as many of you noted, other metrics pertaining Certainly, we are seeing payroll growth move up.  The three-month averages of total and private payroll gains are now around 180,000 a month, whereas at report, they were to the labor market-such as the workweek, labor force participation, and the employment-topopulation ratio-also point to continued improvement.

much slack remains in the labor is an important issue that will bear on our decision of how long we should wait took note of comments by Presidents Fisher and George, Now, a number of you commented on the issue of how market, and that before beginning to tighten policy.  I for example; you do hear reports of labor shortages in some sectors and occupations.  But, as

see shortages.  President Lacker described a very interesting piece of if I'm summarizing it properly, involved creating an index of in than would be captured by U-3, the behavior of this broader measure of to that in past business cycles. of the labor market. President Evans and others noted, this is something of a chronic situation-there are areas in which we do persistently research at the Richmond Fed that, underutilization of labor, with weights reflecting transition rates into employment.  And, as I understood the conclusion of this research, it is that, while in some sense there is more slack the labor market underutilization relative to U-3 is, nevertheless, very similar Therefore, U-3 remains a good single indicator of the state now curtail my long- and short-term can't hope to adequately summarize the is that we should be quite skeptical about jumping to the conclusion that it's drives inflation.  There for being skeptical about that conclusion.  I also intended to describe we can learn a lot from cross-regional and lot of work of that type at the Board-and, really casts doubt on that conclusion.  In my own comments, I it appears to put pressure on wages in the cross-section work that Kocherlakota described. A number of you commented on a topic I was going to discuss, and I will comments on this, which pertains to work by Krueger and others about unemployment and their effects on inflation.  I arguments that Vice Chairman Dudley, Governor Tarullo, and others made about this, but I think the bottom line here only short-term unemployment, which is now down to normal levels, that are a number of reasons some recent Board work that Governor Tarullo did a much better job of describing than I could. But, as President Kocherlakota also emphasized, cross-state comparisons.  There's been quite a obviously, by your staff-and it will briefly come back to the policy implications of this.  A number of you-President Kocherlakota and Governor Tarullo-noted that part-time employment also seems very high in comparison with U-3, and that President

April 29-30, 2014

lot of individuals out of the labor market, including retirees, are likely to reenter the there is more slack than what would be captured in U-3.  Certainly, if a portion of the labor force participation is the trends, labor force I thought President Rosengren also described interesting empirical work that suggests that a workforce as the expansion continues.  And I think the bottom line of that-I'm not positive-is that decline in labor force participation reflects cyclical factors and that likely to increase, then we may see an outcome in which-and this is similar to what's in Tealbook-instead of declining further because of ongoing secular participation could just flatten out.

with very little indication of acceleration.  That seems consistent with substantial received this morning, which Bill described, a long time.  I think the story here wage growth may be currently held down by the fact that while some firms wages, many were either unwilling or unable to cut wages as much as actually fall as much as we might have expected during the downturn, but now it explains There was also a lot of interesting discussion about wage growth, which most of you see as quite low remaining slack, and I guess the ECI data that we are consistent with that.  I found President Williams's discussion about downward nominal wage rigidity very interesting.  I've been fascinated by the topic for is that nominal during the downturn cut they would have liked.  That may, on the one hand, explain why wage growth and inflation didn't why, as the labor market is improving, wage growth isn't picking up as much as we might expect.  I believe President Kocherlakota mentioned some anecdotal information that's consistent with that.

think most of you who discussed this topic mentioned that you to expect inflation to gradually move up toward our 2 percent objective, and that you the CPI readings, as being consistent with stabilization.  President Turning to inflation, I continue saw recent data, particularly

April 29-30, 2014

costs, import costs, and topic of inflation-the fact that inflation, as Presidents Evans and Kocherlakota running at a very low level.  And we're not seeing any clear signs at this point that it George and the Vice Chairman mentioned a number of trends in shelter medical prices that could push inflation up over time.  But there were cautionary comments as well on the noted, is will move up quickly back to our 2 percent objective.

what could throw our forecast off course, many of you mentioned concern you as being external-namely, events in Russia and Ukraine; risks pertaining to shadow banking and housing markets risks in that we're seeing evidence of reach-for-yield behavior in Turning to the topic of the main risks that slowing growth in China and potential there; and financial-stability fixed-income markets, including leveraged loan markets, in which terms and standards are continuing to deteriorate in spite of our guidance.

labor market and spending suggest that the labor market is continuing to the improvement is likely to be sustainable.  On the related question of just much slack remains in labor markets, I would say that I have also been spending quite a bit the distinction between long- and short-term unemployment-the work by Well, I have very little to add.  I agree with the consensus I heard around the table: Incoming data on the improve, and that how of time thinking about

April 29-30, 2014

that Governor Tarullo and Vice Chairman Dudley discussed in detail-and agree with their conclusion that this on the general conclusion that there is a big difference between shortlong-term unemployment has a notably weaker influence on inflation than Krueger and others have been reading with interest recent papers on this topic.  I work really casts doubt and long-term unemployment and their effects on inflation.  I would note, though, that even if it were the case that short-term unemployment, that doesn't quite settle the question of how long-term unemployment should affect our policy decisions.

long-term unemployed really look no They're individuals least until the firms are finding that it's becoming they do exert less pressure on wages and prices, although I am skeptical of that.  But, even if demand would certainly help the might be higher inflation.  Well, at seems to me that we our dual mandate.  To me, the right policy response is to low rate of labor force participation and that, a when, ultimately, we will face a tradeoff between our objectives.  If that happens, The evidence, as I read it, suggests that the different in terms of their characteristics than the short-term unemployed. who want to work.  In that sense, they are quite employable, in spite of the fact that employers may have a tendency to pass them over at much harder to find qualified applicants.  Until they become reemployed, it could be the case that they do, it looks as though more rapid expansion of aggregate long-term unemployed get jobs, and the potential cost of that this point, inflation is running well below our 2 percent objective.  So, in pushing aggregate demand to try to bring them back into the labor force and into jobs, it currently face no tradeoff in terms of provide enough accommodation to push down long-term unemployment, along with other manifestations of underutilization, such as the still very the high share of part-time employment for economic reasons.  If we follow a strategy like day may come

that's something we will have to address, I presume, using a balanced approach.  But we're not at that point yet.

and let's turn next to the policy go-round.  I think we're going to are some small proposed revisions.  When that's done, we'll turn to Bill for his briefing. Let me stop there, distribute a slightly revised version of the statement that responds to the data from this morning; there

anticipated action in alternative B has us on a preset course, but MR. EVANS.  If I could ask a question, the stepping down asset purchases to $45 billion a month.  I know we're not if I just project that continuing into the fall and add up what we're going to be purchasing until the termination of the purchase program, it's somewhere around $190 billion, depending on the assumptions that you make about that.  Now, it got my attention that our testing of the overnight reverse repo program at its maximum, nonweird month amounts to $180 billion.

it were suggested to me, I'd push back against it because we're when we do the overnight RP exercise.  That market.  It doesn't change the MR. ENGLISH.  I haven't heard anything like that in my conversations with market participants, and I think that if basically substituting overnight RPs for reserves doesn't change the amount of duration we've taken out of the

market.  So it shouldn't have an effect on the rates.  It shouldn't undo the effects of the asset purchases that we conducted. amount of prepayment risk we've taken out of the longer-term

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lacker.

the gross amount of triparty repo is unchanged, and so to the stuff that used to be financed that we're now sort of displacing in market?  Is that a sensible question? MR. LACKER.  This raises the question I've asked before.  Some of the data that the Markets Group has provided suggests that we're displacing some RP financing that would have taken place anyway.  The question that raises is, what happens the RP

of this is the think we should be that concerned about. MR. POTTER.  It's an excellent question.  We have looked at it.  Some interdealer trading, which I don't

MR. LACKER.  What do you mean?  But hold on.  I'm not sure I understand you.  So this is formerly financed with other dealers that is not being financed now?

with the collateral that they have.  That interdealer market has come facility.  I don't as having a negative or adverse impact on the broader funding environment.  It's market work.  More recently, what's the supply of bills has come down.  So what you've seen is people investing in the example, some of the larger banks would have attracted some of that cash over this MR. POTTER.  Yes, it's exchanging more toward the end of the day, when they're trying to line up their funding down in volume just a little bit.  Some of the activity we see when there's a large takedown in the overnight RRP is due to the primary dealers coming into the overnight RRP view that something related to how the internal mechanics of the repo happened is overnight RRP who would have invested in bills.  They would have probably invested in other areas.  For period of time, and then that would have been reflected in the reserves.  Reserves have been

Treasuries held privately is being financed in the RP market and we're now is being financed.  This is just a simple way of thinking about it. financing it some other way.  Now you're telling me their MR. LACKER.  I didn't understand how the first half of what you said was germane.  If a certain amount of in the RP market, less of that Somebody must be holding that or bills might have rolled off.

MR. POTTER.  No, because the Fed is financing some of its Treasuries in the repo market.

people who used to finance their Treasuries in the RP MR. LACKER.  Right.  So then the market aren't financing them there anymore, and I'm asking who's financing them now, or are they holding them outright?  I'm asking where do those get financed now?  That was the question.

MR. LACKER.  This gets to President Evans's question, really.

There could be flows into those look to see if we can determine whether it is displacing funding.  I haven't seen any evidence yet that it's displacing funding at this level.

GCF interdealer trading is where most of that would be absorbed. MR. POTTER.  The MR. LACKER.  Okay.  Do you understand the question?

MR. POTTER.  Yes, I understand the question.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota.

Chair.  I wanted to follow up with 1 of 13.  This shows the median dealer expects us to end the purchase program at the October meeting.  Could the split among the dealers and you give a little more information?  What fraction of MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes-thank you, Madam Bill on chart 1, 'Median Dealer Purchase Expectations.'  This is on page that you look at the dealers expect us to go to December, and what fraction expect us to end in October?

MR. ENGLISH.  I actually forget.  Do you remember that, Simon?

dealers expect that you'll be at $15 billion MR. POTTER.  I think a slight majority of the and go to zero, but I don't think there's any conviction around that; this is the median.

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So the split

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Okay, so it's is something like 14 to 8. about two-thirds to one-third.

MR. ENGLISH.  It's a little bit more in that direction in the latest survey than in the previous survey.

looking just at the median is probably not the MR. POTTER.  I think we've learned that best estimate.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Rosengren.

a very picayune question.  We've had two quarters of the MR. ROSENGREN.  Mine is negative growth in residential investment.  In the first paragraph, we're talking about

April 29-30, 2014

reflecting the fact that we now have two quarters in a row of negative recovery slowing.  I wonder if it might be more accurate just to say 'the housing sector has slowed,' which is residential investment.

recovery in the housing sector remained thought being that a broader set of indicators suggested we still had some underlying housing sector.  Things are better than they were.  But you're right.  The Bill? MR. ENGLISH.  I think we wanted to say 'the slow,' the sense of recovery in the residential investment number in the NIPA has been negative now for two quarters in a row.  Is that right, right.  One question would be whether you want to look at a whole.  Housing starts did pick up in March. So there wasn't a further deterioration in March. MR. WASCHER.  Yes, that's March or you want to look at the first quarter as Permits were about flat.

as just saying 'the housing sector has slowed,' just seems more accurate to say 'the housing sector has slowed.' MR. ROSENGREN.  It's just that you have quarters that are adding up that are negative. The word 'recovery' doesn't seem as consistent -it's a picayune question; it

MR. FISHER.  But it has been recovering.

it's a close call.  We actually did discuss this yesterday and value to suggesting that the Committee still thought there's a recovery weather.  The latest information from March is a the sector seems as MR. ENGLISH.  I think thought there was some going on in the housing sector, even though we've seen some weak data.  Partly, the first quarter, we think, was weak because of the harsh winter little bit more upbeat.  So taking out the thought that there is a recovery in though it might send a stronger signal than we wanted to send.

DUDLEY. And prices are still going up, which is part of the VICE CHAIRMAN recovery process.

April 29-30, 2014

YELLEN.  Yes, I agree.  Other questions for Bill?  President Lacker. CHAIR

is for a different Bill.  I totally understand if you blow disposable personal income at a 1.9 implications, but, looking at the line for real disposable personal income in the on board what the implications are, but what were you thinking about real disposable the consumption outlook, this is important. MR. LACKER.  I apologize.  This me off, because this was just released two hours ago, but real percent rate is 0.8 percentage point below what you had for the first quarter.  I'm not going to ask you about the Tealbook, you had a big acceleration coming in the second quarter.  I know it's too soon to ask you to take personal income?  For improvements in the labor we'd get some additional growth in wages and salaries.  In addition, some of the reflects the expiration of the emergency unemployment insurance this morning.  Some of the miss in think the biggest chunk was net expect the wage and salary numbers in okay. MR. WASCHER.  We were expecting, with the further market, that drag in the first quarter compensation program, and so that was a temporary drag in the first quarter that wasn't going to be repeated in the second.  We looked briefly at the data income in the first quarter was in wages and salaries, but I interest payments, and there was some in nonfarm proprietors' income as well.  I don't know what to take from that, but it wasn't as though the first-quarter wage-income numbers came in a lot lower than we were expecting.  So I think we'd still the second quarter to be

MR. LACKER.  Okay.  Thanks.

Apart from by unusually severe winter weather, I expect to play out largely as projected when we announced the beginning of the proceeds, keeping the economy on expansion.  Nonetheless, the unemployment rate remains elevated, These circumstances warrant staying on our current MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  The outlook is virtually unchanged since our March a transitory first-quarter slowdown, caused in part the recovery to continue taper.  Economic growth is poised to pick back up as the year a path of sustained moderate and inflation is below our longer-run target.

April 29-30, 2014

that signals a highly accommodative future path for the funds path for policy.  This includes a further measured reduction in the pace of asset purchases, combined with forward guidance rate.  Alternative B delivers that message clearly, with minimal fuss.  Thank you.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lockhart.

Chair.  Taking a leaf out of President Fisher's MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam book, I've been wanting to do this for a long time:  I support alternative B, and the statement is fine.  [Laughter]

portion of the statement I was unable to persuade to drop last month.  I'll pass on the opportunity to restate my case. MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  There isn't much to say about today's policy decision.  I support alternative B, except for the you all that looms in my mind is how we should respond if economic news or other developments over the simulations, in which you control not going to know the causal driving factors with precise certainty. to decipher.  It would be worthwhile for us to supplement the is that we should be cautious about jumping to the conclusion, if rates move could be telling us something important.  I'd point out the box on the longer-term real rate.  Others have commented that we don't know if is going to muddle through in the high 2s or low 2s. Looking ahead, I think the issue markets push up longer-term rates in response to course of the process when we begin normalization.  Unlike everything, I think we're And it could be difficult preparations we're undertaking on the operational front for normalization by spending some time thinking through various scenarios for how longer-term rates play out during this normalization process.  My instinct pretty sharply, that markets just don't understand how dovish we truly are and start pushing back on longer-term rates.  Markets uncertainty about economic growth is going to 3½ percent or

April 29-30, 2014

of things can show up in the sensitivity of longer-term rates, and that doesn't even point out that, in one of the most successful periods for bills-only, and the market determination of longer-term rates to provide us with signal and feedback about how policy ought to be guided.  Those are my thoughts Those kinds mention expected inflation.  I'd just monetary policy, the '50s and early '60s, our operational strategy was underlying motivation was to allow a sensitive right now.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

so far, especially considering the volatility that to taper at this juncture.  This morning's weak GDP report does give me pause, it surprised me to the downside.  While I'm willing to accept the judgment that MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I also support alternative B for today.  The tapering process has, in my judgment, gone well we experienced during the 'taper tantrum' of last summer.  My judgment is that we should continue however, as economic growth will pick back up in the second quarter, I do think we need to see tangible evidence that that is actually occurring, as Vice Chairman Dudley referred to earlier.

A and C.  [Laughter]  As currently envisioned, the Committee's strategy is to end the goes well, to begin raising the policy rate in part, what the case that the economy performs either better than expected, worse than a betterthe taper.  The response to a weaker-thantapering process.  The response to a stronger-than-expected Because there is nothing to talk about in alternative B, I thought I would talk about alternatives open-ended QE program later in 2014 and, if all sometime in 2015.  Alternatives A and C are meant to address, at least Committee's options may be in the alternative C, or worse than expected, alternative A.  The phrase 'performs better or expected' is a judgment made by the Committee.  As currently stated, the response to than-expected economy is to increase the pace of expected economy is to pause in the

April 29-30, 2014

at a faster pace and presumably end the purchase program sooner.  Given our think that both of these of future policy in the desired direction and economy is to taper experience at the June meeting and the September meeting last year, I possible policy actions would move expectations would have a substantial effect on financial market conditions.

as coming to an end in the second half a period of essence, approaching a fixed balance sheet, the policy value of choosing A or a pause in the tapering process, but also maybe even an increase in the pace of purchases, low levels of purchases in the remainder of this year.  Here, rather than C could envision not just pushing the pace of purchases to zero more quickly, but robustly, having a so-called a controlled reduction in the size of the balance sheet.  As options about would be more effective and maybe as we proceed through the rest of 2014 and before in 2015 at which we'd actually be thinking about raising the policy rate.  The my comment is that alternatives A and C, should we need to employ them, may effect as we get to smaller and smaller asset purchase amounts.  Thank However, conceptually, we are viewing the taper of 2014-that is, the pace of purchases would hit zero and evidently remain there for time.  The size of the balance sheet, given our reinvestment strategy, would remain fixed. Because we are, in C is diminishing as we reduce the pace of purchases to smaller and smaller amounts.  This may be leaving the Committee without good responses to adverse developments in either direction during the remainder of 2014.  A possible fix for this would be that alternative A could envision not just because we'd be at very $15 billion, you might envision alternative A going to $25 billion or something like that.  And alternative also, in the event that the economy were actually performing quite negative tapering, or how to respond to developments in either direction, these should be the way we should think about this we get to the point bottom line of not have a large enough you, Madam Chair.

For economy continues our path of reducing asset purchases labor comments I heard around the table than the language in alternative B.  Rather labor market data have been mixed-nearly all of in the past several months have actually improved.  So I'm not quite sure why we want to send a signal which is obviously a improved.  So I would actually be inclined to think more about describing paragraph 1 with alternative C.

Even if our current will rise only very gradually, we should make sure we position our we can move interest rates up more quickly should that be necessary. language in paragraph 5 that says that, in determining the time of liftoff, the I also believe we need to be thinking a little further ahead.  At our last meeting, I discussed some of anticipation is that rates communications so that Notwithstanding the

Committee is going to assess progress toward meeting our objectives, I'm get concerned that goals are met.  We should be careful, and we need to work on language the concept is even recognizing the high unemployment rate and the very low inflation rates.  We've not I would also note that, with the exception of the nominal GDP rule, all of the rules reported in the Tealbook, Book B, suggest that we should have liftoff by the third quarter.  And that yet agreed on why we want to keep interest rates lower for longer, even after we have reached our inflation and employment goals.  That was the conflict, it seems to me, in paragraphs 5 and 6.

they did a nice job with that.  An equilibrium real rate-I'll lower than its longer-run level would be one rationale for anticipating lower rates.  It doesn't appear, though, from the March SEP that many participants lowered that lower-than-normal long-run funds rate.  So I think this is a topic the if we're going to consider allowing  * to vary of our policy rules, this is going to be very hard to communicate, and about how we put a discipline around making those a very it's a very difficult issue for the Committee to face. The discussion in the Tealbook, Book A, of a lower long-run natural rate of interest was a very interesting one, and I thought call it r*-that is nominal interest have yet Committee should continue to discuss, because r over time in the context we're going to have to be very clear decisions.  What theory and what evidence are we going to use to justify that?  The kind of discussion in the Tealbook was a useful beginning to having that discussion.  But it's complicated issue, and want us to do this or to become a case of the tail wagging the dog.  That is, interest rates, and then we take down our estimate I would not we decide for some reason that we want lower

I'll reiterate what I said earlier and yesterday as well.  I think it would be prudent more directly, particularly in the context of the of the discussion that we had yesterday.  I think linked.  And how we integrate those into our discussion of reducing and then perhaps beginning to reduce reinvestments-maybe that becomes a path.  I don't know.  But we need to begin thinking about that, so I encourage us to Finally, for us to begin thinking about our balance sheet exit principles that we've talked about before, integrating a discussion of how we're going to go about shrinking the balance sheet in the context those two things are purchases continuous put that on the table for discussion soon.  But for today, I can support alternative B and the language.  Thank you.

couple of communication issues that President Plosser has further clarity as the economy strengthens, particularly because about how, 'even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent As the economy strengthens, though, I think there are a worth considering, and both of these happen to be along the lines already raised-one related to our longer-term forward guidance and the other the reinvestment policy.  Notwithstanding my own ongoing concerns about unusually low interest rates for this extended period of time, I do think the effectiveness and credibility of our forward guidance are going to demand some paragraph 6 talks

April 29-30, 2014

that 'economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target could create some communication levels,' we expect federal funds rate below' its long-run level.  This guidance challenges.

headwinds are the reason for low rates, we should try, over we know what we are trying to offset by holding low.  The equity risk premium, a low housing share of GDP, and fiscal headwinds are some have been noted in the past as weighing on the recovery.  As these factors move instead moving our policy rate with longer-run neutral rate has fallen, we should be aspects of the policy to our market participants or risk sending As President Plosser noted, there have been a range of views as to why a below-normal target might be necessary, and several explanations have emerged around fighting lingering headwinds, following a highly inertial policy rule, or responding to a lower long-term equilibrium funds rate.  If persistent time, to be more specific simply to ensure that rates factors that toward more normal levels or not, we can be prepared to reassess the stance of policy.  But if these headwinds are, in fact, subsiding and we're considerable inertia or have a view that the prepared to explain these other confusing signals.

note briefly is one that was referenced yesterday reinvestment policy and how we talk about that.  I noted from the recent memo that widely regarding expectations of cessation of reinvestments, from early The second issue that I would just around the compared the Tealbook assumptions with survey-based measures of market participants that dealer responses varied 2015 to mid-2016.  So the signaling aspect of such cessation will likely be strong, and I think our groundwork that we might lay could help coalesce expectations around our intentions as we go forward.  Thank you.

April 29-30, 2014

Chair.  I'm willing to support B at this meeting.  The FOMC adopted a new communications framework in its about this framework, and, as we move forward, I his recent speeches.  However, changing the forward guidance one about FOMC credibility.  So at this meeting, I'm willing to support alternative B. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam alternative March statement.  I continue to have concerns believe that the Committee should strongly consider the kind of forward guidance described by President Rosengren in meeting after adopting a new communications framework would present challenges and raise questions my remarks, I'm going to pose three tactical questions about policy I think would be best for us to attempt to answer in our internal deliberations in the next meeting, barring large changes in the outlook.  That leaves one last, dangling In the remainder of that meeting or two.  My first question is, October versus December?  In our communication and internal deliberations, we have largely locked down the reduction in asset purchases to be $10 billion per $5 billion to be the subject of fierce press attention.  Do we plan to zero that out in October or wait until December?

plan to implement and communicate our current, very the fed funds rate?  The SEP suggested that, over the course of by considerably less than 25 basis points per meeting.  How, we raise the fed funds rate target by less than federal funds rate target, feeling that might be even more of an issue as we exit this time around.  Another approach would be My second question is, how do we slow planned rate of increase for 2016, the federal funds rate will rise exactly, do you prefer to implement that?  Will 25 basis points per meeting?  Now, of course, we might be changing the as we discussed yesterday.  The concern I have about that is, even in normal times, having that degree of control over the fed funds rate might be challenging if we were trying to raise it by, say, 10 basis points a meeting.  From the conversation we had yesterday, I came away that

April 29-30, 2014

is, move at some meetings and not others, let's say at press conference the choice we prefer to be chunky-that meetings.  But that has other challenges associated with it.  I'm not saying this is an impossible problem, by any means.  It's more that we should be thinking ahead about so that we can develop appropriate communication plans and, if necessary, enhance our technical ability to move whatever target rate we want in smaller-than-usual increments.

what President Plosser said here, too-we should contingency-I view this as remote-that we might want to raise our very be true. As I suggested yesterday-and I like also be planning for the target interest rate very rapidly.  Some of the learning by doing might have to be in a compressed time frame if that turns out to and George have made today.  There remains uncertainty in the markets about think it would be useful for us to have that. My third question just follows up on remarks the Vice Chairman made yesterday and Presidents Plosser our reinvestment policy.  I've heard about it as well.  So I a conversation about that and try to achieve

to achieve our projected slow pace of interest rate increases?  And what's our policy about stopping reinvestments?  I think that, for all of these questions, temptation to use a 'we'll figure it out when we get there' approach, but my experience future.  For Chair, the process we used to get to the communications framework and businesses form more precise expectations and reduce policy own right.  So I'd hope we can resolve these uncertainties in The three questions, to go over them again, are as follows:  October or December?  How are we actually going going to be there's a on the FOMC is that we get better policy outcomes when we plan proactively for the example, I thought, Madam that was announced in March-while I didn't agree with where we ended up-was exactly the right one.  Planning for the future and communicating plans, when we formulate them, to the public help households uncertainty, which is a benefit in its

would recommend we communicate our discussions in the next meeting or two.  If we can, then I our conclusions to the public as well.

rule with a fixed intercept. we can provide that we can unite behind in a consensus way in this and the public more generally. I agree with both President George and President Plosser about r *.  The thinking in markets about how our reaction function works is shaped by a Taylor And the more guidance Committee about why exactly we see that r * being low would be very helpful for market participants in all I say I'm willing to support alternative B.  I do have one minor concern, but I'm willing to let it slide:  Alternative B presumes that winter is over.  [Laughter]  This is not true Districts.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

support B.  I thought Jay made an interesting and important point a little earlier this morning that the gap between the baseline scenario and upside risk has actually narrowed a noted-and I think a couple of others did as well-that external downside risks it's very hard to quantify what those external downside risks are, and I anything on either in the statement.  So the language should remain as is.  Thank you. MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Like everybody else, I alternative to the effect good bit.  I probably increased.  But don't believe it would be particularly productive-it might even be counterproductive-to include

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Stein. CHAIR

support alternative B.  I think we're on a good to line up roughly with that reaction function. MR. STEIN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I trajectory.  I'm comfortable both with where I believe our collective reaction function to be and with the fact that market-implied estimates seem

April 29-30, 2014

me a bit of pause-this is something that we talked about a little expectations in a first-moment sense.  Rather, it is market to say, implied volatility.  For example, I think long-dated swaptions-say, 10-year interest rate-they're pretty close to where they were.  They're above the very low on long-term rates.  And, stagnation and all of that, that doesn't feel as though it's really naturally justified by think you'd want to argue that fundamental uncertainty is The one thing that gives bit yesterday-is not market expectations in a second-moment sense-that is Simon mentioned some of the numbers, but, basically, if you look at the 3-month option on a really just a hair away from where they were a year ago, which is in turn just a shade all-time historical lows in May 2007.  So implied volatility is particularly given all of the subjective uncertainties we've talked about in terms of headwinds and secular the fundamentals.  I wouldn't historically low.

going on and what implications that might have for think you struck exactly the right tone in communication.  For example, in your press conference, you emphasized that the and it's not a precise statement of where we will be.  On the wonder whether everybody is listening to you or market players who've taken a made the world safe for a long period of time.  There's something to keep an eye on.  It doesn't have any we talk about this or as others talk about the point that the dots and all of that are not a some element of forecast.  And, in an ideal world, the market comes to So I wonder a little bit about what's investor behavior.  On the one hand, Madam Chair, I your recent path of the dots in 2016 is a forecast other hand, the volatility numbers make me whether, as I think was the case a year ago, there's a set of different view and think that we've nothing to do about it, particularly.  It's implications for the statement.  I do think that, as outlook and the forecast, it is useful to make the locked-in path but have

April 29-30, 2014

rather than all in a big chunk at some point.  But I think we're in a recognize that gradually basically good place.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

I think the asset purchases is on a path that is well understood by the markets and well in received, and it's well designed to withstand the evolution of events in the economy. the last meeting to undercut the SEP in order to prevent it from last meeting.  While I think that has de-risked the will be a lot of pushback in the form of, 'Well, why do you and that kind of thing.  So I wonder whether-this is for the intermeeting more credible.  I know we've talked about a lot of ideas for doing that, and MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I'll reduction in keeping with developments in the economy.  I also think that the forward guidance has generally been well It was, however, necessary after sending a false signal of tighter policy at the SEP for the time being, it does seem as though, in seven weeks, you're going to be standing in front of another set of dots, and there show us these dots?' period-there is something we can do to either kill it off-I suppose not-or modify it in a way that would make it they haven't had wide support.  But, in any case, it's something to think about in the intermeeting period.

isn't in the decision whether to stop reinvestment at the middle of 2015 or at the end of 2015I think the liftoff decision is probably going to be very, very fraught.  So it would be very wise to that's what I would do. Finally, on reinvestment policy, my takeaway from yesterday's colloquy was, there a lot except for the signal-because there's just not that much that's maturing.  And I guess that take the reinvestment decision off the table in some way now, before we get even close to that. That's probably well understood, but

April 29-30, 2014

that this will be my last meeting as your And with that, let me conclude by saying I hope anchorman.  [Laughter]

MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

CHAIR

DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B. think the large-scale revisions of the statement that we implemented in March have changed over the intermeeting periodtoo unchanged over the intermeeting period-and market participants' own.  So minimal changes to the statement are in B does. VICE CHAIRMAN Generally, I worked well.  The 10-year Treasury yields are little maybe a little bit expectations appear broadly consistent with our order for this meeting.  That's what alternative to have a dots problem in terms of our SEP the dots back as really that practical.  If we're preaching I'm more inclined to favor even Committee clarity about where the But, like others, I do think that we continue submissions.  So we need to do some further work on what could be done to ameliorate that problem.  I don't see pulling transparency, then we have to practice transparency.  I guess greater transparency, and one thing we could do is to actually mark the dots as members versus nonvoting participants.  That would create a bit more weight of the FOMC was in terms of the dots.

thing we can do, though, is something that the Chair did in her speech New York:  She emphasized the uncertainties that surround the forecast how monetary policy will evolve as the forecast changes. I do think another at the Economic Club of and therefore the uncertainties about That's a theme that we could provide greater emphasis to, because the fact is, the dots of the SEP have this perverse consequence of overemphasizing the modal forecasts in the markets' minds,

April 29-30, 2014

bit so they understand that this is almost certainly not likely and then it feeds back into very low volatility that actually concerns us.  If we can get people away from the modal forecast a little to be realized, that would be another way of addressing the dots problem.

and resolve that. generally sympathetic with Governor Powell's view that putting it after the liftoff in just because we're going to be quite liftoff itself is going to do with respect to financial conditions. might be best, but I'm open to discussion on that. As I said yesterday, we've got to get the reinvestments issue on the table I guess I'm terms of short-term rates probably makes the most sense, nervous about what the Separating them by some period of time is a word that would apply very, very, to both of you.  It's been a pleasure to work with you both, and I and everyone else on new endeavors. Finally, as the Vice Chairman, I want to thank Sandy and Jeremy for all of their work and for being such good colleagues.  The word 'collegial' very well the Committee wish you the best of luck in your

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Okay.  Well, I think this has been a very good suggestions for what we should be doing in coming reinvestment policy and how we're going to along with our plans for normalization; what to do about the dot plot; and paragraph 6, which these on the agenda for to today's decision, I heard widespread support for B as indicated in the statement.  Therefore, I think I'd like to put forward for a vote morning. CHAIR discussion, and we've heard many valuable meetings, particularly in terms of looking at communicate that other matters, including possible ways to clarify the logic of the guidance in many of you have mentioned.  We'll keep these in mind and try to put future meetings.  But, with respect alternative the statement in alternative B, as given by Bill English, according to the handout this Matt.
