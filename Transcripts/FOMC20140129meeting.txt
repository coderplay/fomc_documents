You received a memo on this.  Item 4 is 'Proposed to the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations.'  I think there I can take items 3 and 4 together.  Item 3 is 'Proposed Revisions to the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations.' Revisions and the Procedural were only technical amendments here, but let me ask Simon if he has anything to say about these two.

I'll try to get through MR. POTTER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a prepared text. it pretty quickly.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.

each year, the Committee reviews the the domestic open market that the Committee approve the authorization with one small similar to the paragraph 1B. MR. POTTER.  At its first meeting authorizations you just spoke about.  And, with regard to operations, I recommend wording change that would make the structure of paragraph 1A structure of to update the Committee on two items related a significant amount of agency debt and agency MBS, and it is in MBS.  As such, I recommend a continued suspension of Market Operations in FederalSecond, the current authorization codifies the Open Market Trading in agency MBS for the SOMA through agents such as asset with the domestic these two items. In addition to this change, I'd like to the domestic authorization.  First, as you know, the System Open Market Account (SOMA) contains conducting transactions the Guidelines for the Conduct of System Open Agency Issues. Desk's ability to transact managers.  This year, we plan to remove this service from our agreements asset managers, which would allow for the removal of paragraph 3 from the authorization next January.

I propose that this type of for Security of FOMC staff recommends that this be addressed sets of amendments.  Please note that the vote to reaffirm these documents will include amendment transmission of pertinent information on System foreign currency operations to appropriate officials of the Treasury communication instead be governed by the Program Information, which currently governs the transmission of similar information.

As a result, new language in the three these liquidity swaps and, where appropriate, the treatment of the liquidity swaps and that of the reciprocal swaps that were with the central banks of Mexico and Canada as part of the North (NAFA).  There are five specific changes I'd like related to the swap arrangements.  First, I propose aligning the review terms of existing NAFA swap for the liquidity swap arrangements.  Under this proposal, the terms of existing swaps would be referred for review and approval to any changes in the terms, and the terms shall be consistent with the To enact this the Foreign Authorization swap arrangements' to the Procedural with the addition of paragraph 1D.  I also propose replacing the reference with broader language that states, 'Any new swap arrangements shall to the Committee.' The second set of proposed amendments pertains to the central arrangements.  At the October 2013 meeting, the Committee approved standing facilities with the Bank of Canada, the documents is intended to incorporate align put in place American Framework Agreement to highlight and approval process for any changes in the arrangements with those changes in the Chairman instead of the Committee.  The Chairman would keep the Committee informed of principles discussed with, and guidance provided by, the Committee. change, I propose moving the language in paragraph 2 of on 'changes in the terms of existing Instructions to 'the proposed terms of any new arrangements' in paragraph 2 of the Foreign Authorization be referred for review and approval maximum term of any drawing in the Foreign Authorization in light of the previous proposal procedural instructions govern the terms of all swap drawings.

This also affects paragraph 2 of the will require an annual vote on the third or fourth FOMC meeting of the October 21, 2013, memo on this topic.

I plan to ask for this vote at the year along with the vote on the NAFA swaps.  This is consistent with the approach Steve Kamin and I proposed in the

I address this change with the Instructions. Fourth, I would like to expand the current Committee prior to initial liquidity swap drawings.  Specifically, Chairman or the Foreign when possible.

Lastly, any changes swap arrangements shall be referred consistent with my earlier proposal for handling changes in the terms of the NAFA swaps.

5 is 'Proposed Revisions to the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Strategy.'  What we have before us was circulated before the meeting.  It is the statement to 'reaffirms its judgment' and updating the central tendency for longer-run that number comes up.  So this is essentially identical to the statement of Item Policy that we have approved in the two prior years, with only two, nonsubstantive changes-changing 'judges' unemployment where

Governor Yellen tells me that she intends to ask a new will be headed by Stan if he is confirmed and willing, to the Committee and see if there are any raised.

MS. YELLEN.  That is, indeed.

Today we have before us the statement as amended.  Does President Plosser. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. anyone want to comment on the statement?

any objections I'm not sure the remains considerable uncertainty both in the about what we mean by true maximum employment and what And I think we struggle with understanding what it means and how it varies over I'm concerned that, unfortunately, over time, the markets and the public have come to we've said.  We had a discussion about this when we first launched is a topic for the Committee coming up-but I'd be inclined to so that we don't find ourselves SEP changes.  We ought to think MR. PLOSSER.  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you very much.  I don't have to the first change, in terms of 'reaffirms its judgment' versus 'judges.' nuances there will be picked up by the marketplace, but, nonetheless, I'm fine with that. Regarding the second change, though, there marketplace and around this table it actually is. time. think of what we report in the SEP as somehow our target as opposed to some information about our assessment, despite what this statement-and maybe this try to drop the last two sentences of that paragraph altogether having to change the unemployment numbers every time the

doing that-at least dropping the last sentence even if we don't drop the second-to-last as something for discussion and for consideration by Committee.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. about sentence.  So I'd like to put that on the table this it's something that the subcommittee would have to It's certainly a very substantive change.  We do say, in the course of the statement, that is our assessment of the long-run normal unemployment rate and that it can change.  This, of in fact, can change.  President Kocherlakota.

But I'm very glad a subcommittee will be think that-and I mentioned this maximum employment and inflation gets closer to play more of a role in our deliberations.  And financial stability second paragraph as being a factor that we take is not linked back to our think that is a potential opportunity for account; that was the only comment I had.

Also, maybe taking a fresh the inflation paragraph would be worth doing in two respects:  first, maybe clarifying a CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank MR. ROSENGREN.  I'd like stability look at little bit more the difference between a target and a ceiling and how the Committee feels about

So when it's time for this two other suggestions, those would be things will put all of these suggestions before the new CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We subcommittee when that deliberation begins.  Governor Tarullo.

to believe that it doesn't actually reflect more effective think it's done any Chair-I'm very comfortable with those explanations. MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will again abstain from the vote on the adoption of this statement.  On the one hand, I continue a strong enough consensus among Committee members to permit a communication of our policies to the public.  On the other hand, I don't particular harm, and, particularly as interpreted and explained by the current Chairman-and, I'm quite confident, the future discussion of the entire statement.  Some of you years ago were focused on the absence of what I with the two policy aims of the dual mandate set forth in the Federal Reserve Act, which is, I continue to have those concerns, although, way in which the inflation number and 2.3 percent, respectively, over the next several have a forecast of inflation at 1.4 percent, 1.6 percent, and is to say, deviating on the downside by upside deviations a moment ago. I do welcome the prospect of further may recall that my original concerns a couple of thought to be an explicit enough statement of our having a symmetrical loss function respect to after all, the source of this Committee's powers. more recently, I join Eric in having some concerns about the is actually understood-whether it is understood as a target, properly stated, or as more of a ceiling.  I dare say that some members of the Committee would be distressed with a forecast that inflation would be 2.6 percent, 2.4 percent, years.  But, as we sit here today, we 1.7 percent, respectively, over the next three years-that exactly the amounts hypothesized as

January 28-29, 2014

clear:  I pose this hypothetical not to argue for a specific policy response, but draw attention to what I think is at least a latent issue with respect to the stated goal of current statement.  So when it comes time for Committee deliberation would be very interested in hearing an elaboration of not only the points that have made by some of our colleagues but also, I hope, the points that will be made by I want to be just to 2 percent inflation in the on this, I already been others of you.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Program for Security of memo was circulated.  I think the most substantive item here is to create a deputy the SOMA.  Did you have anything to say on this, Simon? Item 6, 'Proposed Revisions to the Rules of Procedure, and the FOMC Information.'  Again, without prejudice, I would say that both changes were mostly technical; a manager for the role of the deputy manager. MR. POTTER.  No, I think the memo discussed

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  The memo was circulated.  Are there any questions or concerns?  [No response]  If not, may I take this as approved?  [No response]  Okay. Thank you.

and the deputy as manager.  Given that the new deputy to Vice Chairman Dudley. Item 7, following on item 6, would be the selection of the manager manager.  Simon Potter is again willing to serve manager position has been approved, Lorie Logan is willing to serve in that role.  Let's have some discussion.  I'll give the floor

DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Lorie is a fine choice.  She in the Markets Group when I was head of the Markets Group back chief of staff when Brian was the Markets Group, and today she's essentially Simon's direct deputy on the SOMA and VICE CHAIRMAN played a very important role in the darkest days of 2007 and 2008.  She was Brian Sack's head of the the Treasury operations in the Markets Group.  So she's extraordinarily well qualified to be the deputy manager.

After we finish with that, we can come back and ask questions financial markets.  Just to clarify, the proposal is as follows:  First, extend this exercise in order to allow more continuity with counterparties so that they can count on allotment, but increases in the allotment would Chairman's approval, and the staff has said that it will come back to the Committee to going to full allotment.  Finally, continue to manage the rate within 0 to 5 to minimize interference with the federal funds markets and other money markets. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.

We've been remarkably lucky in that sense-people seem to view this as It's rearranging the liabilities on the balance sheet of the Fed.  No one has this with tightening yet.  That's one of the concerns we had back in September, but so think the range of 0 to 5 basis points is really important, means that you're not really affecting financial conditions in a broad sense.  What in overnight markets, where we've seen low rates recently over where the usage goes up, but that's really affecting functioning within those money conditions. MR.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.

DUDLEY.  I had a question.  If you raise the bid limit, presumably take-up would probably be pretty modest, as the chart that shows that most people even close to their limit today.  Is that correct?  Is that a reasonable inference? VICE CHAIRMAN the actual aren't

I looked back at the transcript of the last meeting, and I said $30 billion $66 billion-we did $94 billion today.  So I'm a little bit lot of people bidding between $1 billion and $3 billion.  We've seen more people due to the Treasury bill supply issue and year-end.  The highest usage we've had is $198 we went above something like that.  And then you have to MR. POTTER. to $40 billion.  And we're averaging wary of what that would actually look like, depending on where market rates are.  What we've seen is a bidding above $1 billion than you would have predicted from who was capped out.  That could just be billion, and it would surprise me if

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.

we're moving too the horse in the process.  I actually can support time from a year to, say, six months-until July or that nature.  But I also would prefer that we still maintain a cap on the size of the sort of precommit at this point that we're on a path as I don't think this Committee has reached that decision yet.  And I see says we shouldn't, perhaps, raise the cap.  I'm not objecting to that, either.  But I to leave the cap in there until such time as this Committee has done the work that we're and agreed on what its consequences may be and which direction we reason why we have to jump the gun at MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'm concerned that quickly on this, maybe putting the cart before continuation of the exercise and believe there's more work that could be done.  My recommendation would be to scale back the something of allotment at this point.  I see no reason to toward full allotment, nothing that prefer talking about doing in April want to head.  And I don't think there's any particular this point and be predisposed to or prejudge the outcome of that discussion.

funds market has clearly shrunk because could cause the funds market to the fed funds target.  It may be difficult, once we go we need to what path we're going to be on going forward and keep with where the Committee stands on this.  We've the possibility of that regarding our exit strategy principles, and those principles still There are lots of open questions.  The federal the system is awash in reserves.  This overnight repo facility shrink even further and perhaps even die away.  At such a point in time, it may be difficult for us to revive that market if we choose to revive to full allotment or get very large allotments, to pull back on this scheme at all.  I think to make a very deliberate decision as that constrained in a way and in tandem discussed

rate are we going to target?  Perhaps Treasury repo rate.  Is that a good choice?  Are there other choices?  Do we that's going to be to execute?  How much collateral would we have at this and to hit any kind of target?  Which In some of the experimentation, I think you'll something about that and, as I said, what the volume of transactions would need to be. the scale of interventions that would be required to execute this policy? the fees?  What about the costs of executing this policy?  The repo market is very than the funds market.  It extends well beyond banks.  Perhaps that's really an rate that goes beyond just the banking system.  I'm open to that But there are costs as well, and what are those costs?  Are we further blurring the monetary and fiscal policy in a way in which we're standing up and guaranteeing supply Treasury collateral to all takers at any particular price?  I think the main the near term for supporting the RRP, as Simon said, is to shore up the leaky IOER, in to the funds rate.

can be that the Committee needs to grapple with.  We need to I don't know the answers to all of these questions.  Perhaps they're easy and answered.  But I think these are questions understand where we're going before we go too far and find ourselves in a place where, perhaps,

And so I would not want to make a decision today that would lead to staff is doing a lot of work to raises the cap and raises the scale of this sense of what all of the ramifications we'd rather not be.  As most of you know, I am framework that decouples the size of our balance that's a good place this de facto choice of such a framework going forward without the Committee making some deliberate decisions about that.  As has been mentioned, the prepare this.  But I think we need to be patient, get that work done, and have this discussion. Then perhaps we can make another decision that operation more gradually, once this Committee has a better of this strategy might be.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker.

meetings, short of full implementation, we're always left wanting to know some more about the effects of this.  I have some serious about how we're going about this, though.  I think we're putting the cart before the at this time, even with the checkanalytical work, which I support commissioned that in steps the way they're laid out in this resolution.  But I'm not, given the open lot of them.  One thing I'd add is that the staff really puzzling because it implies a diminution of someone MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support further exercises.  As Governor Stein and I have been predicting for a few going to be concerns horse to expand the time frame and to authorize full allotments in that they talk about, before having the benefits of the staff's and strongly encourage.  We should have the benefit of that work.  If we'd September, as I'd suggested, I think we'd be in a good position now, and I'd feel comfortable authorizing the questions we have.  President Plosser outlined a seems to view increasing the bargaining power of some financial market participants as an important benefit of that.  I find that

January 28-29, 2014

monetary policy operations as targeting else's bargaining power, and you don't usually think of the allocation of bargaining power.

the path we're on that give me pause.  One mentioned by the manager, and it's that some market participants have been reluctant to join in some of the documentary material, he that reluctance as due to switching costs-costs of severing counterparty relations. a situation in which backing ready to go full steam ahead in this I think it's too soon to go raising barriers to our changing course.  It's too soon to There are two elements of irreversibility to was the program, not knowing how long we're going to be committed to this.  That's one of the reasons he advocates a one-year extension.  I think that, refers to Well, by the same token, should that switching occur, we'll be in away from the program would impose switching costs again, and that would raise a hurdle and would impede us from changing course if we weren't direction. commit on that basis.

thing is the fed funds market.  Yes, 5 basis points is below generally where things, but this is a collateralized transaction, and you'd expect that to trade a little federal funds.  The risk here is that we suck all of transactions out of the market-the Federal Home Loan Banks and the GSEsis the odd-lot stuff.  Now, on a day-to-day basis, federal funds trades are a bunch of trades up there in the 20s and low 30s, conceivably go from low, middle single digits, up to more than 20.  I don't know-the Desk obviously has that if we the shift out of the federal funds market that the staff is, I The other we've seen bit below an uncollateralized transaction like the large dollar and what we're left with range up to 30 or 35 basis points.  So there and they could dominate the effective rate.  The effective rate could from about the the data on it, and I don't think we need to get into that.  But the principle here is expand too rapidly, we could trigger think, rightly concerned about and that we need some analysis of.  We've got legal contracts,

January 28-29, 2014

like, that are pegged to and that write in, as with LIBOR, this effective rate, and here OIS and the we're risking changing drastically the meaning of that rate.  We ought to be really cautious as we tiptoe up to that.

the time frame to a horizon just after a meeting at which we not authorize full allotment at think that would be enough for another round of a step-up in learning from, in terms of the effect of this program on the structure of money So I'd prefer that we shorten we're confident staff analysis can come back to us, and that this time and we just authorize $5 billion.  I operations.  Clearly, we learned a lot at year-end, but, since year-end, there's been usage that we're markets.  So that would be my suggestion for this resolution.

MR. POTTER.  Mr. Chairman, could I respond?

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.

interest on excess reserves can achieve the goals that structure.  There's no doubt that is, we'd like to learn how to raise rates in the smoothest the start of next year-a possible time frame under that much time to learn about how to do that in the smoothest the exercise to be extended in a way that we think we can learn the I think this is the discussion we had last time, President Lacker, on this issue.  When we this was the best setup in which to learn the most in the next months, particularly if there are operational changes that we need to make to make this more 0 to 5 basis for the moment. MR.

And if you are raising rates at some measures-we don't have way, which is why we'd like most. were thinking about it, we thought few effective.  And the big change we're not making is changing the rate structure; that's points

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.

January 28-29, 2014

that we go to full allotment in MR. FISHER.  May I ask a question, Simon?  Is it critical order to achieve what you just described?

you think of taking $10 billion or $20 billion as the and multiplying by 120 counterparties, that's a lot of money. MR. POTTER.  It is not critical.  If cap

MR. FISHER.  Right.

between how much we want to be in the counterparty relationships that are there right now and how much we want to be a later date if this is something that we use at a later date.  What we're doing means if and they're well above 5 basis points, you shouldn't see that much takehave, and it should be the case that you do get market rates moving up a if the bargaining power does go up.  So that's the bargaining power that people get. we're not transmitting the rate way that we'd like to. MR. POTTER.  I think one of the tensions here is intrusive intrusive at market rates go up a lot up of the facility that we little bit Some people have less bargaining power, and that means that structure fully through the

I've expressed it in the media-I have enormous President some good points, and I am a little uncomfortable going to like to have this Committee fully briefed; a lot of this is quite esoteric for or any participant's or raise a very good question.  I'm allotment for the same reasons that they expressed.  Again, I want to in the MR. FISHER.  Well, as you know-and confidence in the way you-and your deputy, by the way-operate.  But I do think Plosser and President Lacker have full allotment.  I would all of us.  Again, this isn't questioning our confidence or my confidence member's confidence in you, because we have enormous confidence in you.  But I do think, Mr. Chairman, that President Plosser and President Lacker uncomfortable with full underscore-and Simon knows this, and you know this because you've seen it New York Times -that I have tremendous faith in you.  But I think we need to be educated in the process

January 28-29, 2014

We cannot say that it's critical right now.  We can still learn more by MR. POTTER. increasing the cap.

want you to learn more.  That's a key thing. MR. FISHER.  And we that I would find it harder to learn in a way that's neutral if we a long horizon over which to do that.  Setting up these speed bumps is a worrying the speed bump is sometime in the summer and you see markets the forward guidance.  They will be hypersensitive to some of the things learn about at that time.  That's why probably the 12-month extension is a bigger deal full allotment.  It doesn't have what people have expressed-this feeling that we have to percent once all of the MR. POTTER.  I'd say didn't have thing to do, particularly if getting worried about we try to than going to full allotment right now.  I do think that something like $10 billion to $15 billion, looking at the chart I have here, allows us to learn more than $5 billion would, and that's very close to be going down this road.  I would say, personally, that the chance that you will choose this as one of the main tools that you use to control interest rates is close to 100 memos come back, but you might want to wait and find out.  That's fine, because it's your choice.

being fully comfortable with this exercise-although I do tool for us to use.  Personally, I actually see it funds rate.  But I think we should be cautious, if only in order that we have MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to recommend that we not go to full allotment-again, just in terms of agree with Simon that this is going to be a critical replacing the federal

January 28-29, 2014

because it is not critical that we go to full allotment to achieve a better a full understanding and operating understanding.  So that would be my recommendation-say, do the $10 billion.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Would you be comfortable with $10 billion? MR. FISHER.  Yes, sir, I would.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.

DUDLEY.  I agree with Simon that the time period is more this suggestion that we learn more prior to April doesn't make a lot of sense to me, because that's actually actually going better discussion in April.  I also do have the same concerns as Simon that the more risk of doing something later whereby this is seen strategy.  So I can live with the $10 billion cap, but I feel very strongly that horizon is much better than a 6-month time horizon. VICE CHAIRMAN important than $10 billion versus full allotment, but I also think that shouldn't going to inform the discussion in April.  Learning as much as we can by April is to lead to a we can do now to put this in place reduces the as part of the exit having a 12-month time

just made.  On the have to balance that against some of the costs that President Plosser be more reluctant about certain choices regarding long-run On balance, for me, the way to MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, would prefer to have the $10 billion cap at this time.  I appreciate the remarks that the Vice Chairman other hand, I think we pointed to-that going down the path of experimentation creates potential costs for us in terms of irreversibilities that might lead us to operating frameworks.  So there's an interaction between our experimentation now and our choices later that we should be taking into account as well. compromise between these tensions is a cap at $10 billion but an extension for a full year.

January 28-29, 2014

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  The proposal-$10 billion cap and one year-is on the table.  Is that acceptable?  President Lacker.

The concern about the time horizon that I hadn't heard before has to do the possibility that an announcement we'd make at the end of that period about extending further could become confused with a signal about the exit strategy.  Two things. I think we can communicate the separation.  We've done that with all of our experimental think the Desk has reported problems in conveying MR. LACKER. with the exercise First, stuff so far-successfully, I believe.  I don't the separation of these experimental things from policy signals.

we've been careful to try to do that. MR. POTTER.  Probably because

MR. LACKER.  Right, and I trust that we'd be careful again.

MR. POTTER.  Yes.

less risk of confusion a year might be confused the argument on that ground. MR. LACKER.  But, second, it strikes me that there's no from now than there is six months from now at announcing something that with a signal about exit.  So I just don't see

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.

DUDLEY.  Well, the second reason to have a longer time horizon is, will take this as something that is going to be more long lasting.  So VICE CHAIRMAN of course, that people they're actually going to adjust their counterparty relationships in a way that makes the test more realistic.

Which is the controversial part. MR. POTTER.

That is the controversial part, but you want something actually going to behave in substance if you VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. that's actually going to behave in testing how it's

January 28-29, 2014

think the 12-month time horizon is also appropriate it's going to make the value of the information we get better. move to substance subsequently.  So I because

We can also use rates if we want to ease the switchback.  We can operate to offer negative rates only.  There are lots of things you could to smooth people back out of it.  There's maybe a six-month for people. MR. POTTER. at zero rates.  You could decide do if you wanted to use prices horizon on the typical relationship.  So going a bit past six months is helpful

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.

Can I ask when the staff work is expected to be ready for us? April meeting. MR. LACKER. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The

We had a test of the federal funds market over year-end in which there federal rate.  One story we've heard is that the overnight RRP actually helped with that because it market participants definitely believe that it is providing a somewhat floor at the moment-just at this level. MR. POTTER. was a reduction in the FHLBs' supplying fed funds.  You saw a very small decline in the funds was propping up rates.  So firm great, but we're talking about the advantage of a long period a little bit It strikes me that April is less likely, if anything, to be confused on the exit ground. more attractive than the coming MR. LACKER.  That's being building up momentum in participation, and that's exactly what makes it irreversible. So the 12-month period from this April to next April seems 12 months.

and then vote that against the original proposition.  Does that seem fair? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, if you want to do this in a parliamentary way, you could make an alternative amendment.  We could compare your amendment with the $10 billion amendment

Sure. MR. LACKER.

January 28-29, 2014

What's your alternative?

That's $10 billion with a January date? I meant $10 billion with a one-year extension. MR. PLOSSER. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. MR. PLOSSER.  Yes.  Okay.

We'll take the winner of that and then ask whether we want right?  So there are now two potential amendments on the That's 1, 2, 3, 4.  Who's in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

At the start of the morning tomorrow, I would like to go through the suggested we might want to make MR. POTTER. Desk statement that we would release because the discussion some changes in that.

Now let's questions for Simon on first three exhibits, that the decision we took at the last meeting was and had little or no impact on Desk operations.  You also mentioned, and we table in front of us, that the 10-year yield has actually come down.  The last time I is, it's come down to close to the 3 percent area.  But think that was the word you used-recent selloff risk assets.  I think that we have to keep this in perspective because we had about a 30 percent The S&amp;P is now two and a half times its March 9, 2009 low , and we see that, FOMC meeting, the S&amp;P index is up 0.5 percent, even though it was up a You can see that in the right-hand chart.

But I'm personally more in what happens in the bond markets.  And you would expect a reaction, of course, in the Committee to be aware of the fact that it would not be at of the single direction it's been going in for an awfully long time.

At the risk of tempting fate, it's hard not to In previous Tealbooks, we of real GDP were misleadingly weak, and that ongoing declines signals regard the brighter tone of the incoming data over the intermeeting period as giving that hypothesis greater credence.

Turning to the labor market, the December employment report was a mixed bag. On the establishment side, total nonfarm payroll December.

As a result of the changes we made to the supply side-and the surprises to output and the unemployment rate we now have an output than in our previous projection and an unemployment gap that is ¼ percentage point narrower.  Moreover, we project that the unemployment rate will cross your 6½ percent threshold around the middle of this year and will lie assumed 5¼ percent natural rate look during the intermeeting period at the behavior of the rate in recent years.

As the middle-right panel shows, participation rates for women drop off sharply around age 65 or above participation rate.

The global financial turbulence that erupted the Tealbook to bed last week could, in principle, snowball and derail that to be the most likely outcome.  But before MR.

As years of weak and choppy performance, the economies of our trading partners appear set for solid, sustained after we put this recovery, but we don't consider discussing this risk, I'll briefly review our forecast.

Rather, it is with our forecast of only a gradual moderation of Chinese growth in the next few quarters.  All of is due more to an upswing in risk aversion than to fundamental factors, were it to persist and intensify, it could still damp the global economic recovery and thus bears watching closely.

very important for the Committee to be kept abreast of the that are being held within the Board staff, and so I found that very helpful. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First of all, I want to compliment David on the inclusion of the alternative view in the box in the Tealbook A.  I thought that was a very positive step forward.  It's debates and what we see in the to employment.  I was wondering what the staff's thoughts about gap are. I follow with a question.  Over the last six months or so, there's been, I think, a relatively large gap developing between what we see in the establishment survey household survey with respect that

January 28-29, 2014

WASCHER. You're right, and I think the answer is, we don't really understand could just be The BLS tries to adjust the household survey to the particular case, that doesn't really help very much.  I think the other there tend to be cyclical patterns in the difference between household and employment, and the reverse occurs in recoveries.  One possible explanation for that have a lot of people working off the books for a few hours a themselves as employed in the household survey, but they're not really on technical sense.  So they're not picked up by the payroll survey.  It's that what's going on over the past year or so is that, as the economy continues to sector, if you will. MR. why there's such a difference.  Because they're different surveys, there measurement differences in the two surveys. payroll concept.  But in this possibility is that payroll employment.  When the economy is very weak, household employment tends to fall less than payroll is, in a weak economy, you may week.  They report anybody's payroll in a possible improve, you're getting more people who are moving back into payroll jobs even though they were already in jobs in the 'informal'

To maybe sharpen my question, your sense is that what's MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. going on in the establishment survey is more a sign of the evolution of labor market health than what's going on in the household survey?

that, six months or so, we tend to pay a lot trends in the payroll survey than to those in the household survey. MR. WASCHER.  Right.  Over periods like more attention to the

question.  David, the 1.9 percent assumption on expected inflation in the last chart, in the VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I had a really-almost silly-technical the question is about bottom right of your handout-and it was discussed in one of the memos.  Because the

January 28-29, 2014

therefore it lowered the longer-run average by one-tenth of 1 percent, think that's a weird way of doing it.  Given that think our target was methodology changed, and you lowered expected inflation to 1.9 percent.  I consumers think our target is 2 percent, wouldn't you think they would still 2 percent?  I didn't understand the logic of that.

WILCOX. It's an annoying situation. MR.

I just didn't understand it.  I wouldn't have done it that VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. way, I guess.

Yes, I'm sympathetic to that. MR. WILCOX.

Okay.  I wasn't missing something, then. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

We thought we had a thermometer said it was 32 degrees.  We took a survey of people, and we asked them, 'How cold degrees outside.'  We changed the That's a crude analogy. MR. WILCOX.  No.  But here's the conundrum. outside that does it feel?'  They said, 'Well, it feels about 32 thermometer.  Now the thermometer reads 31.  The survey expectations still were unchanged, as before.  How do we handle that situation?

But we're telling them, on the new thermometer, that 32, not 31, right? VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. we're going to still be at

TARULLO.  No matter what it feels like, it's 32. MR.

WILCOX.  I think that's right, but I don't want to debate it excessively because talking about is 10 basis points on the inflation rate.  Perhaps with this discussion we alert-the Committee to the inflation rate, we think that, at the margin, you'll a more expansionary monetary policy in order to get inflation, as MR. what we're could feel that we've done our job of alerting-and you've helped to issue.

And that's constrained concerned about is, I would be hesitant to have the chart continue to show 1.9 percent inflation expectations in seems inconsistent. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I guess what I'm in future meetings perpetuity when we're targeting 2 percent.  It just

I'm going to drop that.  I have a question for Steve that's more substantive.

MR. KAMIN.  I hope so.

Well, this is clearly relevant, though, to what you show the turbulence recently.  We have a forecast of acceleration we've seen some very Not knowing what's going to happen, do you put much last week in terms of a risk to the forecast, or do you I just want to get your sense.

How nervous are you about that forecast, given that sharp market moves in recent days? weight on what's been happening over the put very little weight on it?

weight on it.  The way I is, as we moved into the second half of the year, when emerging markets were and other advanced economies, we perceived the volatility and we assumed it would last expected so much markets.  In that sense, it's been a little faster and more marked than we consistent with our sense that there were going to be these bumps in the road, and that this MR. KAMIN.  I would say that we put more than very little would put it obviously in a more turbulent situation, responding to expectations of tightening in the United States for quite some time, moving into the coming year.  What's been happening recently is a little bit outsized in comparison with our expectations, because we wouldn't have volatility both to erupt so quickly and to have such a marked impact on advanced-economy equity markets and bond would have expected.  But these things happen.  And, that said, the upswing in volatility is more or less

January 28-29, 2014

right now, we might shave a touch to acknowledge this, but we probably wouldn't move it very much.  So All of that said, we know from experience that seemingly trivial events, like events.  So there's no way we're going to claim right now that, no, that is one of them.  In that sense, if we had to redo our Tealbook forecast it down just that's the baseline. a Thai devaluation in 1997, can unexpectedly lead, through contagion in investor perceptions, to much more egregious cannot happen.

Right.  Fair enough.  Thank you. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

Tarullo. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor

Mr. Chairman, can I just piggyback on Bill's question?  Steve, have growth forecast any sense of the reaction that countries may have in order to stave off more financial problems?  That is, if follow normal prescriptions, they're going to do some tightening of monetary policy and implement some austerity measures, which will presumably bring growth down.  And would MR. TARULLO. you incorporated in your baseline economic emerging market they maybe although that may have the salutary effect of holding off a set of currency problems, it presumably be reducing economic growth.

Both in the December Tealbook and in previous Tealbooks dating back to into our emerging market growth forecast the there would be some volatility and financial stresses, which would directly economic growth, and, on top of that, prospective increases in interest rates, particularly such as Brazil, India, and Indonesia, which would have to raise their rates in order to felt the need to, in some sense, increase the amount of drag we put into our forecast MR. KAMIN. the middle of last year, we had already built expectations that restrain in countries rein in inflation and to respond to the financial volatility.  So we had built in all of that.  The effect on EME growth is relatively small.  It's on the order of ¼ percentage point.  And so far, we have not

January 28-29, 2014

calm down over the next in response to these developments.  Assuming that, in fact, markets week or two, we'd still be good with the adjustment we've put in.  If markets go a different way, then we'll have to respond.

MR. TARULLO.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.

On Steve's side, on the real economy side, one thing you might want to is what's happening to the lease rates for Capesize and bulk shippers.  They've come up to a significant extent, and the Japanese are now building for their own expansion, and yet lease rates are coming up.  Purchase are coming up.  From what I understand from talking to shippers, a lot of this, of course, is slower-a still-significant pace of import demand for iron ore, pulp, excellent briefing, the Shanghai a very useful indicator.  And a lot of changes are taking place with respect to the MR. FISHER. look at significantly.  China drives that market, as you know, and the build market.  They've replaced the Koreans consumption.  So there's a capacity prices driven by-even though it's and whatnot by the Chinese.  As Simon pointed out in his composite is not shadow banking system and so on, as was pointed out.  So I think we have to be careful, but, as you say, we should be watchful.

wanted to make, though, is that, first, I want to agree with President devil's advocate box, I also want to congratulate staff members on their very honest and inflation.  I have just one question that I didn't see answered in it offline-but my question is, when we talk about measures model or the FRB/US model, are you all focused on changes in slack level of slack?  It's not clear to me what we focus on or what we input. The point I Kocherlakota.  I think Mr. Wilcox has done some great work.  I like the being a devil's advocate; straightforward paper on price that paper-and we can talk about of slack either in the EDO or just the

January 28-29, 2014

most part-and I'll look to Jeremy Rudd, who was one of the we do have some specifications that have a speed effect.  We MR. WILCOX.  For the authors-it's the level of slack, but inspect those specifications from time to time.  Jeremy, do you want to add anything?

that have a speed effect.  We find that particular speed effects level of to a natural rate construct. MR. RUDD.  I'd say that our main focus is going to be on the level of slack.  As David said, we do look at specifications are present for some of the less-finished goods prices-commodity prices and that sort of thing. But we find, in general, that our main emphasis is on the level of the gap, which is the the unemployment rate relative work on it-Evan Koenig, sitting behind maybe we could be of some help there. MR. FISHER.  Thank you.  We've done some me, has done some work on that difference-and

Keillor's ointment, am I correct that, in terms of the four census areas, the West in December compared with the three frozen areas, as it were? might have been weather-related? Finally, on housing, you mentioned single-family permits and starts.  Because the fly is in Garrison actually had pretty good numbers So could you deduce that this

WILCOX. It could be.  Normally, the permits numbers are much less affected, and referring to they can get down hall and file a permit application pretty much regardless of what the weather conditions the permits numbers, those, historically, have been less MR. so when we're looking to explain an anomaly for starts, we often take refuge in permits.  Generally speaking, the anecdotes from builders and others are that to city are.  So when it comes to looking at affected by weather anomalies than the starts numbers.

with that, but I just did note it.  There was a differential, in the starts.  And then you mentioned examining the pace of future homebuilding. MR. FISHER.  I agree particularly You have some questions about that.  For what it's worth, again, I take a deep dive with the

January 28-29, 2014

their a direct correlation to immigration policy and, second, that the spring season started early.  But where they're really or frictions is in the ability to retain labor.  As you know, most homes are by Mexicans-I've talked about how there's a little Costa Rican contingent-whether it's it doesn't matter.  But I'm hearing this across the board, for what it's a price impact.  So that's one thing you might want to examine.  It's the realm of monetary policy, but, according to the builders themselves, it's not just a point I wanted to put on the table. homebuilders in my go-round before this meeting.  What I found interesting is that, first, biggest concern is labor supply, which has their expectation, of course, is finding cost pressures built in Maine, Seattle, or Dallas, worth.  And it also has outside insignificant.  That's

WILCOX.  Yes, we've been a little surprised.  To put exactly the same idea, I think, as though the industry may be undergoing some greater in getting back up to the kind of capacity that we saw before the recession.  Our ease over time, and that we'll get back to a in which builder capacity is much greater than it seems to be today. MR. in slightly different vocabulary, we've been a little surprised about how steep the short-run supply curve is, and that it looks adjustment costs guess is that those short-run supply restrictions will situation

MR. FISHER.  Thank you, and again, thank you for this good work.

you.  President Evans. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank ask one and get I'm interested in the alternative simulation in I'm maybe worried that our analysis doesn't to low inflation relative to our target.  So let me try to get that out.  In the inflation rate is knocked down, and it stays there.  So the real rate would be high, economic growth.  But because the funds rate was going to start MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have two questions.  Let me an answer and then try the second one, if I may. the Tealbook related to low inflation, and I guess assign a very high cost simulation, the and that would be bad for

to move up quite so much, and it can basically offset that because the zero lower bound is not really binding anymore.  That is, if with the baseline outcomes, they're spot on. really no real So I guess I'm wondering whether there is a significant cost in these analyses to having a if the zero lower bound isn't binding.  Just so that people aren't concerned that I think it's symmetric.  If we had a higher inflation rate and might also have the to that and what its implications might moving up, it has the ability not increase in the real rate you compare the real outcomes in this simulation There's no loss of economic growth; there's no additional unemployment; there's cost. low inflation rate this is only a low-inflation question, we could offset that higher run of inflation with a different funds rate, we same type of outcome.  I'd be interested in your reaction be for how we specify our loss function with regard to missing our inflation target.

to create versions that would be more pernicious in terms of their is only one.  We thought this was one that was worth looking at.  The Japanese for example, did feature a fairly lengthy period of very low inflation but not a much of the implication for real activity, but I entirely agree that, with other it's possible to have a much more serious consequence for real activity. MR. WILCOX.  I would agree with you.  This is one version of a low-inflation scenario, and I think it would be possible implications for economic activity.  We thought this one was among the range of possibilities, of which this experience, cumulating downward spiral, and that's what we had in mind here.  You're right that, through the period in which the zero lower bound becomes less of a constraint, monetary policy is able to counteract mechanisms, bit, and so I understand the scenario, and it does seem reasonable.  You're trying to have a run of low inflation.  I wondering the following:  If you told me that inflation in 2015 was going to be 0.8 MR. EVANS.  Yes, I kicked this around with my staff a little rules of the guess I was percent after it had already been like that, would I then expect GDP growth in 2015 to be

January 28-29, 2014

I don't think I'd have that high a probability on that, and it is probably because I'd in mind-more like something that knocks down aggregate demand and what you're trying to get 3.4 percent? have a different scenario does something.  But that's a different scenario.  So I take your point of across here.

issue would be, what's the precipitating shock that gives to the persistent low inflation, and is it conceivable to imagine a shock directly to inflation doesn't operate predominantly through weaker activity? are other precipitating shocks that could do that. MR. WILCOX.  I think a critical rise expectations, and hence to inflation, that But there

All right.  Let me move on to the second question, and thanks to the staff Sorry.  All right.  Anyway, I'm going to tackle a bunch of tough issues, and I think in your equation 1 makes a lot of sense for how you're going doing it. MR. EVANS. for the inflation memo.  It was impressive analysis, as almost always-given the way that I refer to my own 'somewhat expert' staff, I mean, how could you expect me to say something different [laughter]? that the inflation specification about two ways to is what you lay out here.  There are a bunch of special like that that show up as your colored boxes.  You've got and it's these anchored long-term inflation want to get your reaction to, because they're playing an awfully large this.  That's the first hypothesis.  It's a bunch of special factors.  They're largely inevitable Okay.  But now, having said all of that, let me ask the unfair questions.  It's also the case that global inflation is low, as Steve just mentioned.  And I guess there are at least think about that.  One hypothesis factors-energy prices and things anchored long-term inflation expectations, expectations that I really role in transitory-that's why they're special.  They're going to work their way off, and it's that we're going to have inflation move up unless something else happens.

January 28-29, 2014

would be to back off the emphasis on the long-term inflation if you inflation ought to low inflation. a common explanation.  Those are two types of common explanations.  So we're just to get inflation back up to its target. The second hypothesis expectations.  And I appreciate how important they are for fitting the specification, but couldn't have that, then the hypothesis might be that each country has a monetary policy that somehow just isn't accommodative enough in order to get inflation up, because be monetary, and so everybody somehow is doing something similar.  It's global So something that's affecting inflation is happening in each and every country.  You think it ought to be not fighting hard enough in order after thinking that through, reading the memo, and looking at equation 1, I'm struck We've got and we've got a relatively flat Phillips curve.  So we going to contribute a time.  And that's exactly where you can see a role for lot, given the modeling Vice Chairman Dudley was asking about is another little once you link yourself to that anchored inflationary expectation.  I guess, more deeply about it, the question is, what's the role for monetary policy in this Now, wondering what monetary policy does to keep inflation close to its long-run target. anchored long-term inflation expectations, can debate the size of the resource slack for quite a long time, but it's not ton right off the bat for quite some monetary policy, on a meeting-to-meeting basis, to have some effect, but, instead, we've got long-term inflation expectations anchoring everything.  So that matters a choice.  The 1.9 percent question that annoyance in all of this when I think specification?

WILCOX. We think that monetary policy, as we said in the memo, plays a crucial in supporting inflation expectations.  Predominantly, my overwhelming reaction to your feel really good, because it sounds as though the message of the through very clearly.  We're pinning a lot on this role of inflation expectations, and MR. role remarks is, boy, that makes me memo came

January 28-29, 2014

an arguable proposition.  I think it's fair to say that it survives only because, at this point, it alternative that we've been able to come up with.  We've got a fundamental problem as we were attempting to build a model of inflation expectations, what We'd put the variable we want to explain on the left-hand side of an constant term on the right-hand side explanatory variables.  Well, the conclusion that-oh, wait a minute-that constant term does a pretty We don't have any variation to explain in the left-hand side variable. of monetary policy in influencing inflation expectations.  So I'm not think a main message of the memo was precisely the word 'magic.'  Another possibility would be to that it is, to a degree, unfortunately, an article of faith.  I wish I could represent it to you it's beats any social scientists here.  If would we normally do? econometric equation.  We'd start out by probably putting a of that econometric equation.  And then we'd start looking for other we'd quickly arrive at good job of explaining the left-hand side variable.  You all, by running really good monetary policy over the past 15 or 20 years, have created a significant problem for us, from an econometric perspective. Among other things, that immediately creates the difficulty that it's very hard to posit a causal explanation for the role going to offer any pushback, because, indeed, I that.  I believe I heard Governor Tarullo use say otherwise, but I think it's important to acknowledge that.

certainly is doing similarly in the euro area and in some other locations.  There I me the important point that our inflation errors than our prediction.  In 2011 and 2012, the opposite was true. to come to the Committee and say, 'Well, we've With regard to the global phenomenon of a downward drift in inflation, it very eye catching that, at the very same time that inflation drifted a little bit downward here in the United States, it was think Jeremy, again, and the others impressed on over the past few years have, in fact, been two-sided.  Now, it is the case that, most recently, inflation has come in a little lower It made me feel no more comfortable back then

extraordinarily MR. EVANS.  Thank you so much.  The memo and your response were useful.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.

the 'Forecast Summary' exhibit that shows the MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me follow up on President Evans's comment here a little bit.  I did like this chart in 1.9 percent inflation, although I do think it should be 2.0.

MR. WILCOX.  I think I know an adjustment we're going to be making [laughter] for the March Tealbook.

in the anything to study other than the fact that inflation is at target all of the time. MR. BULLARD.  Yes.  But I love your point, which is one I've tried to emphasize past-that a great inflation-targeting bank will keep inflation right at target all of the time, and then you won't have maybe a way to put President Evans's point is that if you look at a chart like this and the impression that a situation like is some sense of, under zero-nominal-interest-rate, low-inflation think we've struggled to be able to say something coherent about that and I don't want to put words in your mouth, President guess, in my interpretation of what he said, that what would be useful to But you say that inflation expectations are anchored, then you get the one in Japan couldn't develop in the United States because, well, inflation expectations are anchored, so it can't happen.  But, as policymakers, I think what we want what circumstances would we get stuck in a environment?  And I to be able to put a probability on that.  So Evans, but I

January 28-29, 2014

is, what types of things beyond that, what could we do to For that, you would need a model of why longer-term inflation expectations might policymakers is some kind of statement about how likely that outcome might lead to that outcome in the United States, and, maybe avoid that? drift, and we don't really have that model.

WILCOX. It's precisely with the Japanese example in mind that Jeremy and his that, in the Japanese case, inflation time, actual inflation, on a long movingintended to put a pit in your collective stomachs is that actual inflation began to track lower and in mind that we wanted to real doubt that we have about whether this will necessarily work MR. coauthors put the figure on page 11, which demonstrates expectations remained really quite stable, and, for a average, tracked those expectations quite well.  But then what's worrisome and is precisely became detached from inflation expectations.  And so it's with that make sure to communicate the out in the way that we've outlined in the baseline.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.

less existential level here on follow up on the comments of President have expressed appreciation for the alternative that was put that's a great contribution.  I look forward to other alternatives manner.  But I had one question about that, and this may asking too much.  It would be interesting over time, as these scenarios are more fully understand that.  But the staff's view of how the probabilities associated these various scenarios may be shifting over time might be a very valuable source of MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Moving to a inflation, I have two sorts of questions.  First, I'd like to Kocherlakota and others who forward in the Tealbook.  I think being laid out and discussed in a similar be described, for the staff to offer some guidance or thoughts about the broad probabilities they place on some of these scenarios.  Are they highly likely or very unlikely?  Clearly, they are not the modal forecast.  We with

January 28-29, 2014

move forward.  So I just put that out there.  I know it wouldn't discussion and insight as we necessarily be trivial.

on in the establishment survey, for all sorts of different reasons.  Have occurred over, let's say, the My sense is that, on average, we've seen a lot more upward revisions from the first as we go through.  Is there evidence of any systematic patterns that arise in the revision the household survey?  In other words, do back, do they tend to move together, or how should I think about that? The second question I had follows up on President Kocherlakota's question about the household survey and the establishment survey.  One of the things we do know about the two is, a lot more revision goes you given any thought to the pattern of revised data that has recovery? print process in the establishment data, particularly vis-à-vis they tend to move

WASCHER. The household survey isn't revised, so it's whatever it is.  It is the in response to President Kocherlakota's question, that there do seem to be the difference between the two, and the household survey falls less than the and then increases less during recoveries.  So there are around and then move back toward each other over time. MR. case, as I mentioned cyclical patterns in payroll survey during weak periods typical patterns.  They tend to move the 2013 revision next month-we already know that it's a downward revision if in both 2011 and 2012 went the that, early in in new aren't picked up initially in the payroll survey.  Beyond that, there tend and weak periods.  So, from 2007 to 2010, there In terms of revisions, the big revisions are obviously the benchmark revisions.  We're going to get you adjust for some classification changes.  But the revisions other way; the payroll survey was revised up.  And I think the general pattern is recoveries, you tend to see some upward revisions.  That's probably due to increases business formation that to be downward revisions during recessions

January 28-29, 2014

were downward revisions, and then in 2011 and 2012, there were upward revisions to the level of employment.

don't want to make too big a deal of in over my head very quickly, but, in terms of the inflation issue, one of the many of the DSGE models have-and I think the New York model has this in it in that the inflation process in those models depends a lot on the nature of the sectors that they have, you can have these shocks to the return on capital efficiency of capital.  And those things can actually work through the system in the nature of the financial sector and the restrictions in the financial sector that or not more work has been done in those types of models-as opposed to the classic, more traditional models that to us on-in terms of the effects that different types of shocks have on generating the MR. PLOSSER.  I have one other observation.  I this, because I'll get things that some detail-is shocks.  In the financial or the marginal ways that can lead, at least in those models, to lower inflation than you might otherwise have anticipated.  It's have given rise to some of that.  So I was wondering whether thinking about you report lower inflation that we've seen.

If he's not, then I'll attempt to MR. WILCOX.  I don't know-is Egon Zakrajšek here? characterize some recent research that he's done.

PLOSSER.  You'll probably do better at characterizing that than I did in attempting the first place. MR. to characterize my position here in or Michael Kiley, are you familiar with this, Broadly speaking, what Egon and his coauthors are trying we have more disinflation?  It's a fascinating paper.  They are working firms whose balance very adversely affected through the financial crisis, and the other bucket, the MR. WILCOX.  I don't know-Jeremy before I launch into an attempt here? to explain is, why didn't with microeconomic data.  They split firms into two buckets:  One contains sheets were

January 28-29, 2014

crisis are much more resistant to allowing price not particularly affected by the financial manner.  And it's that mechanism that provides an complement.  What they find, I believe, is that the firms whose balance sheets were severely adversely affected through the financial reductions, whereas firms whose balance sheets were crisis behave in a more historically normal alternative explanation, by the way, to the anchored inflation expectations that they put forward as a possibility.

not exactly what I was asking.  But we can do this offline.  My is whether some of these models with financial frictions of various kinds get not as closely tied to monetary policy as we normally think. MR. PLOSSER.  That's question movements in inflation rates that are That was the gist of what I think some of these models are trying to tell us, but we can talk about this later.

any comments about that? KILEY.  It's certainly the case that the staff did a lot of work on a variety of models with different types of financial frictions and shocks and on how the different transmitted through those mechanisms.  You're definitely right that those mechanisms shocks are transmitted to say that there's no common there are lots of financial frictions now.  And so I don't think more open area. MR. WILCOX.  Michael, do you want to offer MR. DSGE shocks are and shocks can have effects on activity and inflation that differ from those of other demand shocks.  So it's the case that financial frictions can alter the way in which both to the real economy and to inflation.  But I think it's fair result across those models, because it would be fair to say that it's a general feature that shocks, other than monetary shocks, become much more important in explaining inflation in some different way.  It's a much

PLOSSER.  Very model dependent. MR.

KILEY.  Yes. MR.

January 28-29, 2014

MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Why don't we take a quick coffee break and come back at 4:20 and start our go-round?

[Coffee break]

Let's recommence, please.  We're ready for the President Evans. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay. economic go-round, and our first contributor is to work with you during this difficult period. MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  This being your last meeting, let me just mention that it has been an honor and privilege

meeting the incoming data have been quite good, with the exception that the second half of 1 percentage point stronger than what more optimistic.  As one of my banking directors put it, some of now describing the business climate as 'tentatively bullish.'  Most commentary activity was picking up, and that demand was good of this together, and I am more comfortable assuming that lines of the Tealbook projections. Since our December of the December payroll employment number.  I'm pleasantly surprised 2013 came in at nearly a 4 percent rate.  This is more than we thought in December, and, importantly, it's reflecting very good fourth-quarter numbers for consumption and fixed investment and not just an outsized inventory build.  Our business contacts have similarly become his clients are was more reserved.  Contacts indicated that but not exceptionally strong.  Put all the real economy is broadly firming along the all reasonably well at the moment.  Nevertheless, I remain concerned over is not surprising.  Not much time has passed.  As the Tealbook projections chance that transitory factors have driven these low inflation readings I had preferred delaying our December taper to gather more information, but this seems to be working out the very low inflation outlook.  There hasn't been any real change in the numbers since our last meeting, but that indicate, there is a good

January 28-29, 2014

may work out just fine within six inflation equation itself is tenuous at to my worries over this dilemma when they tell me that they have little pricing power cost pressures are low.  A key reason why cost pressures are low is that wage growth has and that these factors will recede before much longer.  This months' time, but our understanding of these factors and the best, and the risk of prolonged low inflation cannot be ruled out.  My business contacts contribute and that been modest to meager.

spent much time discussing wages.  That's probably because, in recent inflation pressures.  Instead, wages tended to lag inflation.  In any event, the low wage levels and wage growth we see today These wage data suggest possibly more persistent influences on to get an outbreak of stronger and persistently higher inflation, we almost increases in wages.  If such an outbreak were in the to see workers demanding, and firms granting, notably higher wage of my business contacts think it is should note, too, research by President Williams's staff-because of that wages have not yet fully adjusted to earlier labor markets.  That might mean we could see residual resistance to wage increases wage-cost that inflation could remain low for some time.  This poses a a reasonable time frame. We haven't decades, wages have not been a reliable leading indicator for have are, at a minimum, confirming evidence of the lack of inflationary pressures existing in the current economic environment. low inflation.  In order surely would have to have sympathetic works, we'd expect increases, and this should be occurring broadly across occupational and industrial sectors.  Of course, none of this has taken place at the moment, and none at all likely to happen for the foreseeable future.  Indeed, as the Board's inflation forecasting memo discussed-and I downward nominal rigidity, it's possible weakness in for some time, even as other labor market conditions further improve.  In sum, the side of the ledger seems to suggest substantial risk to achieving our inflation objective of 2 percent within

January 28-29, 2014

in our projections is that we expect to exert an upward pull on actual inflation.  The and much of my own staff's analysis has a similar flavor.  I am not that I made earlier in asking is unsatisfying.  Most theoretically grounded specifications place a weight on short-term inflation expectations.  Of course, short-term expectations bounce more and pose difficult challenges for successful empirical implementation.  Most more transitory than what we've had. At the moment, the primary reason for rising inflation anchored long-term inflation expectations inflation-forecasting models discussed in the Board memo place substantial emphasis on these long-term expectations, aware of a better inflation specification in spite of the commentary questions.  Nevertheless, this greater around a lot of the time, anchored long-term expectations work better empirically, and the discrepancy is smaller and modeling choice is completely understandable, but it feels unsatisfying and the case now.  I can't help wondering if this continue to work well under today's unusual circumstances.  Cost 1 percent for some time.  There just seem to be many factors on the ground today The Board's less structural than desired, and that's especially modeling compromise will pressures are low and may remain that way for some time, especially from labor.  How is inflation going to pick up?  New firms are pursuing aggressive pricing, and actual inflation has been stuck near fighting against whatever the upward pull might be from expectations for inflation 5 or 10 years out in the future.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. maintaining our current accommodative monetary policy seems important to counteract the lowinflation-risk scenario.

you.  President Rosengren. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank a very nice job members' positions on the important but difficult issue of which labor market movements and which reflect trends.  The very low payroll month is assumed to be an anomaly, suggesting that much stronger payroll low inflation numbers is an In trends.  While the parsing of these data patterns into transitory categories seems reasonable, I would note with the benefit of hindsight that we have not between what is transitory and what is a trend.  A simple Internet investments during the dot-com phase reflected a change than a transitory revised down once the dot-com bubble burst. MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The memos have done of clarifying staff and price anomalies reflect transitory number last employment growth is imminent.  Similarly, part of the very anomaly, suggesting that we will soon see PCE inflation moving toward our 2 percent target. contrast, the large declines in labor force participation are assumed to be permanent, reflecting primarily demographic and cohort or trend always been able to distinguish well example is the assumption that in trend productivity growth that could justify high stock prices rather fluctuation, only to be

payroll employment number was a surprise. 10-year Treasury rate moved down substantially after the announcement and has only fallen least some of the surprise information, at least for now.  The Tealbook makes clear it is incongruent with Thus, while assessments made by the staff are reasonable, our actions should reflect the inherent uncertainty around such judgments.  The The further with growing concerns around emerging markets.  Financial markets seem to have taken to heart at that it is assumed that the low payroll employment is transitory, because both the other labor market indicators and the stronger GDP growth we have seen recently.

January 28-29, 2014

and the decline in the 10-year Treasury rate since our last meeting, despite strong GDP GDP forecast, give me some pause about the forecast. However, the highly correlated movement of global stock prices surrounding emerging market concerns numbers and our strong many of our PCE inflation forecasts are also in Japan the long-term expectations for inflation being below zero for over a decade.  The observation is inflation data than long-run expectations. 20 years of data well but is sensitive to the time period over which it is estimated.  If it turns out that, in describing the inflation process, we should be much less certain how will return to our 2 percent inflation target. The recent serially correlated misses on assumed to be transitory.  However, the longer we miss significantly on our forecast, the less confidence we should have that inflation will be inexorably drawn higher by the gravitational force of our 2 percent target.  The staff highlights that inflation moved little despite very consistent with work my staff has done.  They show empirically that Japanese may have been more responsive to short-run inflation expectations Similarly, the model that relies on well-anchored expectations fits the past reasonably in very low inflation environments, short-run inflation expectations are more important than long-run expectations quickly we

force participation is good.  The paper provides a nice statistical both demographic and within-cohort trends.  While I agree with the demographic within-cohort trends seem tenuous.  While there were sound economic reasons rise in labor force participation by women in the 1970s and 1980s, the economic rationale a trend reduction in participation by prime-age male cohorts is less clear, and, thus, questions rates will be reversed by a stronger labor market. The staff paper on labor summary of exposition, the for the for remain as to whether their lower participation

In summary, we should be cautious about our inferences regarding which data reflect transitory influences and which reflect trends.  The implications of this uncertainty for policy,

Second, over the past year or two I have lowered my assessment of the inflationary pressures associated with unemployment rate.  As a result, my with maximum employment has Tealbook A.

It follows that, longer run, the mandate-consistent unemployment rate is the unemployment rate that is well-anchored inflation expectations. Let me start with the We have agreed, and we give rise to an expectations well anchored around that same rate.  Of course, the mandate-consistent unemployment rate has over the consistent with 2 percent inflation with a lot of work being done in the System and short-run fluctuations and various aspects of in his remarks.  Trend-cycle decompositions are challenging, This observation has implications for how we go about measuring the long-run mandateconsistent unemployment rate.  Now, there's elsewhere that attempts to do so by filtering out employment and unemployment data.  From a statistical point of view, this is hard work, and President Rosengren alluded to this

January 28-29, 2014

challenging at the end of a sample.  But the economic challenge is actually mandate-consistent unemployment rate, as I just mentioned, is that is consistent with 2 percent inflation and well-anchored inflation necessarily requires information beyond information about the compensation pressures associated with and they're especially a deeper one.  Conceptually, the the unemployment rate expectations.  Estimating this unemployment rate quantity data alone.  It requires any given unemployment rate.  It is those compensation pressures that eventually translate into inflation in the prices of goods and services.

two, I've lowered my There are three main reasons.  First, a falling unemployment rate over the has been associated with little increase in wage and compensation pressures. three quarters of 2013, average hourly compensation in the nonfarm business was essentially flat. Let me then move to my second point.  Over the past year or assessment of the pressures on compensation associated with any given unemployment rate. Why have I done that? past four years Indeed, in the first sector lowered my estimate of the prime-age people, those between the ages of 25 and 54, who will have jobs.  I've so because, conditional on the falling unemployment rate, the employment-to-population to 54-year-olds has risen surprisingly little.  Now, marginally, I see a prime-age putting more downward pressure on wages than a similar person with a the effect on the margin is to lower the Second, for any given long-run unemployment rate, I've fraction of done ratio for 25person without a job as job.

The difference between decline in the unemployment rate, U-3, this difference has fallen little since late 2009.  This large number of people who are looking for extra hours are on wages for any given measure of the unemployment rate.  At the national level, seen little in the way of wage pressures, we have a larger fraction of prime-age people who do not have jobs, and the difference between U-6 and U-5 has remained persistently high.

Similarly, our labor union contacts two.  Why are the unemployment rate is so low?  We a definitive answer to this question, but it is important to note that, relative improvement of the unemployment rate in Minnesota, there has been less improvement in Minnesota employment-to-population ratio for prime-age people.  Also, just as it's true Now, we go to the evidence along the same lines. our business contacts consistently generally see themselves as having little bargaining power in the coming year or wage pressures so muted in Minnesota given that certainly don't have to the the nationally, the difference between U-6 and U-5 in Minnesota has come down little since its 2009 peak.

We have been at a 2.3 percent rate, and all indicators, of course, whether it's activity, have continued to rise to levels that, frankly, we just haven't seen me, from startling figure for me was looking at the manufacturing across the board. Our growing employment last year housing or our export before.  It does raise some questions about difference in frictions, because it seems to the standpoint of our monetary policy affecting economic activity, certainly we have had a very robust response in Texas.  The most employment numbers for December-they are up 7.95 percent, so 8 percent year over year.  That does not include oil and gas extraction or any support services that go around oil and gas.  So we are seeing it surveys indicate a growing number of businesses reporting-and this is what our it for skilled workers, We are also seeing it in unskilled areas.

So perhaps we have less friction, whatever those frictions might be at the state level, or

The rails are back 90 percent of their peak operating capacity, with one exception, Burlington Northern, which this year will surpass its 2006-07 peak operating capacity.  It's pretty much across the board.  There are certain sectors before-for example, coal is down, but board-all of the rails-they are close to being back to peak operating levels.

These hiring encouraging because, among the recent data, the one discordant note was struck by last month's payroll employment release, as a number of people have mentioned.

Compared with a year ago, the number of employment during the next 12 months increased substantially.  While this information is anecdotal, it leads me to downplay the relatively tepid December employment report, and it increases my confidence that course, the unemployment rate did decline further since our last meeting. December's decline in the unemployment rate was associated with another dip participation rate.  But the analysis of the participation rates by the Board staff supports my view that most of the recent decline trends, not the business in part because of the weak labor market, they also seem unlikely to quickly reenter

On balance, then, there has been

to hear notes of caution from I said, distinctly guarded. a clear improvement in District economic activity, but we continue our business contacts.  What optimism they do express is, as the national picture, the surge in economic growth in the second half of 2013 was going to be growing above 3 percent for several years, but I am still not completely upswing in real consumer had hoped.  I would like to see an improvement yet. In striking.  A key question is whether that surge will be persistent or whether it will subside this year.  The recent data strengthen the case that the Tealbook has been making for some time now that GDP is convinced.  One of the most encouraging recent developments was the spending at the beginning of the fourth quarter.  We have seen similar swings before, though, and they turned out to be less persistent than we in income growth to support the pickup in spending growth, but we haven't seen that

only latest Tealbook.  It wouldn't surprise me to see a much quicker bit of steam.  So I'm hesitant to sign onto a been Another reason for caution is that so much of the surge in growth in the second half of last year was attributable to inventory accumulation.  These additional inventories are unwound over two years in the reversal, particularly if consumer spending lost a forecast of persistently strong GDP growth, even though much of the latest data have encouraging.

Thank you.  Vice Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.

DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My views about the outlook the last meeting, although growth in the of the year has been stronger than expected.  I'm pretty much where the Tealbook is; my forecast for economic growth.  I'm still optimistic that the economy income, there household saving rate to decline in 2014.  I also take some up to now.  It has been low level of interest rates, cash sitting on the business sector's balance sheet.  The fact that it now VICE CHAIRMAN for economic growth have not changed materially since second half I haven't really upgraded will grow above trend in 2014.  I think consumption will hold up relatively well, in part because net worth has risen so sharply.  Given the level of net worth relative to disposable does seem to be some scope for the comfort from the recent news on equipment shipments and orders, today's report notwithstanding.  For me, business fixed investment has been a puzzle weaker than I would have expected given the high level of profits, the and the large amount of seems to be on a stronger trend is noteworthy in my view.

Inflation expectations remain well On the inflation side, the drift up gradually over the next few years toward our 2 percent objective.  Core inflation seems to have stabilized, anchored, and the amount of excess slack in the economy is shrinking.

On the than normal over the next month or two, and I would encourage the staff to do some population-weighted heating degree days and how that affects the various economic data.  The winter has been unusually cold, and I really do think this is going to play havoc with the seasonal adjustment process, especially in the construction sector, of course, but meaningful is the degree of excess slack in the than we had a very moderate growth rate.  I am not the relationship between economic growth and the unemployment rate will way in 2014-that the unemployment rate will flatten out even as a good read on three important factors: One issue that I had been thinking hard about economy.  It seems that the amount of slack in the economy is shrinking faster anticipated given the rate of economic growth.  We have seen the unemployment rate decline quite quickly over the past 18 months, even with convinced that necessarily go the other growth stays above trend.  The fact is that we don't have

January 28-29, 2014

in 2014, so we don't know how that growth will translate into will change if the labor market tightens, so we don't know of payroll employment will translate to changes in the unemployment natural rate.  I think the participation trend, in particular, is very difficult decline does appear to be tied to shifts in the composition of the the and the degree of slack in the labor market. what productivity growth will be labor demand; how participation rates how a given growth rate rate; and the level of the to evaluate.  Most of the different age cohorts and secular declines within some age cohorts.  But parsing out what is temporary from what is permanent is difficult, and this creates considerable uncertainty about outlook for the unemployment rate uncertainty about how the level of excess slack in the economy will evolve ultimate timing of liftoff for short-term rates.  So I really less emphasis on the modal forecast and talk about the degree of dispersion around I can imagine we might want to lift off as soon as the first quarter of next year, or this meeting, our too much uncertainty about the timing to continue to formulate it in those the monetary policy statement at the For me, my this year, combined with the uncertainty that I have about the growth pace of the economy, makes me pretty uncertain about the want to put that forecast. many, many quarters later.  Given this, I would prefer to shift, although not at forward guidance more toward a formulation based on economic conditions rather than time.  I just think there is terms.  I think we need to consider how we should adjust March meeting in light of these considerations.  I'll talk more about that tomorrow.

Second, if you look at Finally, two comments, one on financial market developments and another on emerging financial-stability risk.  Although the selloff in some of the EMEs has been very sharp in recent days, I am, I think, pretty much where Steve on the importance of this past week's developments.  First, the selloff has been the sharpest by far in those

Third, from a U.S. perspective, financial conditions really haven't remain broadly supportive of economic activity.  As President Fisher remarks, the declines we are talking about are pretty trivial at this point. our markets, the adjustments in our equity and bond markets by market positioning.  Going into this year, the equities is scope for changed much and still pointed out in his earlier financial-stability front, I just want to briefly flag the Puerto Rican situation.  The in the near future is quite high.  Moreover, could come to a head as a full-blown crisis relatively quickly, and that be viewed as sufficiently idiosyncratic that the knock-on will be modest rather than severe.  But I do think it's worth On the likelihood of a downgrade by Moody's to junk status the commonwealth apparently has limited access to liquid resources to fund its ongoing operating deficit.  This could actually lead to contagion through a number of channels, including the monoline insurers that guarantee a significant portion of Puerto Rican sovereign debt and the broader municipal bond market.  Now, my own view is that although such an outcome would be problematic, I think the Puerto Rican situation will effects to broader financial stability flagging because this is something that could come up over the very near term.

I've read a fair bit of discussion among the staff and analysts concerning the potential effects of bad weather, but I've not seen anyone make shortfall relative to expectations of more than weak December payroll report and thanks, in part, to upward revisions that clearly the labor market.  For now, my hope is that the will prove to be a temporary aberration and that payrolls, on average, stronger gains going forward.

We've debated any number of times whether labor market slack is now becoming increasingly manifest in force participation rather than in measured unemployment, and there are arguments It's important for us to refine our thinking on this matter because, per year, from 2010 through 2012, the labor force The household survey was interpret the degree of labor market slack.

In particular, I'm not at all among the younger and prime-age cohorts who currently state they do not want a job would give the same answer if the job market were notably stronger, if, for example, quits and the pace of hiring were to discount at least a portion of the large decline in the unemployment signals at least some reduction in recent surveys and the news real GDP in the fourth quarter is now projected to be higher than we thought at the time of the December meeting.  Some of this upward exports, which are unlikely to continue making large contributions private domestic final purchases accounted for about component is certainly the recent volatility in financial conditions faced by emerging markets bears careful While I'm inclined rate in December, it does seem fair to conclude that the drop slack.  This view seems consistent with job market perceptions in we received on growth.  The level of 0.6 percent surprise is due to stronger net to economic growth going forward, but one-half of the upward revision to GDP.  The strength we've seen in this good news, and it suggests that the long-awaited acceleration in household and business spending may have finally arrived.  Although the risks to this outlook now seem reasonably balanced, watching.  But, to date, it appears unlikely to derail the generally more positive outlook for the global economy.

In addition to the difficultlabor force participation, our assessment of slack needs to factor labor force that is underemployed.  The fraction of the labor time for economic reasons still stands at 5 percent, a level not far below its percent. While I am we should be careful not to get carried away with our progress.  Let's keep in mind that we've experienced quite a few false dawns over the past real, standards. to-estimate cyclical shortfall in in the unusually large portion of the force working part post-recession peak of 6 percent.

Really, from our point of view, the key should be a more explanation between structural and cyclical factors. Then, briefly, switching gears for a second, I also wanted to say something about the labor markets.  First, I wanted to make one point on the memo, which I agree was very good, although I cannot keep the five hypotheses straight in my mind.  People memo attributes most of the change correct but a little bit misleading, given our policy decision, because, pre-crisis, the expectation of labor economists was for a declining labor force participation rate reasons, the aging of explaining the delta between what that projection in, say, 2007 or 2008 would have been and what we're seeing today.  And I think, when you look at it that way, you probably see balanced as, perhaps, an acceleration of some preexisting unfavorable secular tendencies, the case for labor market is unfortunately becoming stronger, and the absence of market policies has almost certainly exacerbated whatever is, in fact, don't think that we're seeing a lot of evidence is being reduced so rapidly that we're at the limits of what can be After several years of very high unemployment and insufficient aggregate demand as well structural effects on the aggressive active labor occurring.  But as Charlie Evans and Narayana did, I think it's useful to focus a bit on what we have seen with respect to wages, because here I that whatever slack does exist productively done.

January 28-29, 2014

outside organizations have suggested that wage pressures are change in average hourly production and nonsupervisory workers.  It's true that this measure of wages has the past 18 months or so.  Through December, the average hourly earnings 1¼ percent pace in late 2012.  But the average hourly earnings of production shows evidence of marked acceleration.  Rates cost index for unchanged since 2010, with not much evidence of recent that series is noisy enough that it's difficult to draw we've seen. Some research notes by building.

Compensation per hour for workers in the nonfarm business sector presents a fuzzier picture, but, from what I understand, much inference from the recent movements that reports notwithstanding, it's hard to find much evidence of industry-specific in the service sector.  There are a couple of industries, there are nearly always some discrete sectors in which wages at all necessarily harbingers of more If we're talking about construction workers, it's probably worth noting sector as a whole-that is, not just residential but nonresidential decelerate since the end of the recession. Anecdotal wage pressures by looking at aggregate data.

Given the generally positive tenor of the data, I guess I was a else equal, I'm two play out before putting too much inferential As others have noted, we've had some, I guess, modestly encouraging news since our last meeting, most notably the upgrading of spending and business little bit puzzled, I didn't quite know what to make of the payroll number.

And unemployment continues to come Now, I don't mean what follows from here on as in any way a of identifying scenarios that are interesting and potentially challenging for us, the did prompt me to wonder whether something along the lines of the Tealbook's more optimistic alternative scenario-I guess it was the 'Consumer and Business Confidence' just be worth spending some time thinking about.  Concretely, suppose that the faster we've seen positive consumer sentiment or animal spirits and you start feedback.  As a result, economic growth picks up, and, as we move, let's this year, we see growth on the order

This is is, I think, the might want to start wondering about-like the word you used-an 'attack' or a challenge to our forward guidance. down, but it's clear It's sort of in the category of high-class problems.  But-Simon alluded to this-this scenario in which we on the forward guidance to be a little clearer on what I see as the nature of the challenge. there's sort of a hypothetical baseline.  Imagine a situation in which we had idealized is, we had caused the market to fully understand our reaction function. mind meld with the market.  In that case, good news would put upward pressure on a way that we're perfectly comfortable with because, in other expectations hypothesis combined with the contingent nature of the data.  The just as much as it should.  It's really automatic-stabilizer thing.  That's not the scenario to be worried about. Let me see if I can try First, forward guidance-that We had a market rates, but it would do it in words, it's just the expected path of the short-term rate is going up, and it's kind of the

and more realistic situation is one where the market doesn't really fully in the market don't fully understand, and, think about things Note that once we get below an unemployment rate of 6.5 percent, we've said they're qualitative, and because they're not completely unambiguous, mix of economic contingency and time dependence.  We've said things like percent.'  On top of that, I strongly suspect that whatever we say, there's at least a to think of things in calendar terms.  Whatever we've said, driving the front end of the curve. The harder understand our reaction function or some people importantly, there's scope for divergence of opinion.  Different people differently. qualitative things, but there has been some 'well past 6.5 subset of people in markets who like they've kind of heard third quarter of 2015, and that's what's

Now you're going to have an obvious tension between those who have heard kind are thinking in terms of economic conditionality. the message in terms of in a minority, but they may be the guys who are actually buying bonds and buying bonds with leverage. 'taper tantrum' in June, which is that if you get some sort of a run of surprisingly strong news, it brings forward some notion of a day of reckoning.  It sort of crushes the guys who have beliefs that are overly optimistic, however they came by it, and then you worry about there being some upward pressure on rates, upward pressure on term premiums.

That is to say, I think we're supposed in long rates comes from a good understanding of a reaction we get another 100 points on the term premium piled on top of that, that's something we should be happy to recovery.  I don't think it's likely to I don't think it's entirely out of the realm of plausibility.  We got 100 basis points or during the tapering episode, and we're still below a notion of the longlevel.  So it seems like we could have something. I think that's not helpful to happily accept whatever increase function combined with legitimate good economic news.  I don't think if basis accept.  And I think that's actually kind of a risk to incipient happen, but so on the term premium run average answer to what we should do, but I think how we might respond if we get this kind of an upward spike in term in some way as a big increase in term I just put this on the table not because I have an it's useful to think about premiums.  What would we do?  Presumably, we would want to lean against it we effectively did after the tapering thing in the summer, and there was

tapering.  That was arguably the right change in financial conditions, and maybe we'd want to do something else equal, relative to your reaction function, you premiums.  We surprised the market in September by not thing to do, given the analogous, which in this case would be, all would think about delaying liftoff or moving more gradually post-liftoff.

All else equal, what think we've necessarily done a very good job of laying out the premise case.  In other words, I think we've done a pretty good job of laying out the premise-and this-if we blow through 6.5 percent because the unemployment rate is of weak labor force participation.  There I think we've kind think we've groundwork.  I think we haven't really thought about laying the groundwork for how we that That seems like increase in term that kind of shifts your outlook back and makes you want to be more gradual.

Or, if inflation is very low, there I laid the respond to a spike in rates.  Again, that's not a prediction; it's not close to a prediction.  But, as we start moving toward augmenting the guidance, I think it might be worth thinking about scenario.  Thank you.

The fact that the economic growth estimate for the second half of 2013 has been revised up from 2.6 to 3.75 percent is a remarkable markup and imports and inventories, feel a little bit one-timey to me.

In thinking about what to tell the market in the me that some more-fundamental questions arise.  The continuing supply and the alternative view box underscore that there is economy is to potential output.  There are plenty of credible there who are discussing and arguing this.  John Williams mentioned a couple.  There the same lines done by members of the Council of Economic Advisers last unemployment threshold in the very near future. near term, it seems to downward adjustments to aggregate real uncertainty about how close the people out was some work along summer that they shared with us.

Will inflation start to send signals to us, or have disinflationary global The whole analyzing wage and price increases seems to me to be in question, and so I One question that arises, and I think this comes through very well in the inflation memo, is, how would we know if we were closer economy performs about as expected, but the economy is significantly closer to potential than the baseline forces or well-grounded expectations semipermanently muffled the inflation signal? framework for wonder how confident one can be that inflation would actually respond as predicted if that were the case.

inflation will react as predicted in the textbooks.  At that to send a signal?  That may very well happen.  I don't know that anything particularly about potential output, although there's very on that question going on.  But independent of the question of how close it is very possible that keeping rates low for another year can provide too any reason to be shy now about the In a way it's a two-sided problem.  We not only don't know exactly how close we are to potential.  We also don't know whether point, would asset prices step in that signal would tell us interesting staff work we are to potential, much support for asset prices.  We have, after all, been very happy to take credit for strong housing and equity prices, appropriately so, and I don't see

monetary policy, particularly if we do have stronger a damaging asset bubble well before the economy reaches single-B and triple-C bonds have recently approached 15-year lows, which is to say ability of highly accommodative monetary policy to drive prices much, much higher.  I also don't see why highly accommodative economic growth, couldn't produce full potential.  Of course, I don't argue that we observe that.  We clearly don't observe that on a broad basis, although it is an interesting fact that, as the Monday morning staff briefing showed, spreads for extremely low, lower even than they were in the pre-financial-crisis bubble.

a What should the Committee be saying in its public communications about these things To me, the danger of financial-stability risks comes now as the current guidance adequately addresses that.  Let also freely admit that the fact that the inflation signal may be broken, it is also broken on the makes it so hard is that it may not be sending a signal we'd love for it to send level of slack.

I would start with a quick summary of yesterday's discussion and add a few economic growth.  Many saw growth as likely to continue some of the recent growth and may not persist, and we have seen false dawns before. I thought comments, and then we can turn to the policy go-round.

On the one hand, underemployment and long-term unemployment suggest that labor slack is greater than the unemployment rate with slack putting downward pressure on labor costs.  On the other hand, it may be that many of the long-term unemployed and those who have left the labor force did not by employers and, thus, are effectively structurally unemployed.

Some transitory factors, including low growth in expect inflation to move gradually back to target because of a good themselves are determined. Inflation much pricing power, and cost pressures are low and expected to remain low, with a few exceptions, such as import prices and low rates of health-care inflation, are playing some role in holding inflation down.  Overall, most participants the gravitational pull of well-anchored inflation expectations.  However, the heavy reliance on the stability of inflation expectations is somewhat worrisome, in that we don't have understanding of how expectations

forward the economy strengthens and we pass through the 6.5 percent unemployment dealing with possible increases in term premiums or bubbles in asset prices On the policy front, upcoming possible challenges include managing the guidance as threshold, as well as even as unemployment remains high and inflation low.

Let me just make That's a quick summary.  Any reactions or comments?  [No response] a few comments, which mostly play off things that I heard yesterday around the table.

On the one hand, a number of people noted that there were some temporary temporary component.  If private domestic final purchases, those grew at about a 3½ percent rate in real terms level is sustainable, and it does suggest hopeful the reduction restraint, but primarily on household spending. Like everyone here, I am happy to see the stronger economic growth in the second half of last year. components to that-inventories and the like.  On the other hand, it should be pointed out that the shutdown and government spending reductions were a negative you look at in the second half.  That's an indicator, I think, that the that there was some pickup in growth, pending measurement problems, of course.  I am that we might see 3 percent growth in 2014.  That would be based mostly on, first, in fiscal is than at any time during the 1990s and almost as high as it With the saving rate high and interest rates low, that does suggest, on the more quickly than income for a consumers remain cautious.

That currently about 6.2, which is higher was prior to the crisis. one hand, that there is some potential for consumption to grow while, which would, obviously, be supportive of aggregate demand.  On the other hand, one difference between now and the '90s and early 2000s is that most recent thought that

six months.  The report yesterday was just a little more optimistic than that, but not that is in reasonably good shape financially but We will see how that plays out. the next markedly so.  So we have a household sector remains cautious.

to say that I It's a little surprising that it's been as choppy as it has been, rates do remain very low in absolute terms, affordability remains good, and strong.  I think that bears watching.  One concern is that investors played a big role in housing demand in 2013, and they are no interested.  So then it's possible that some of the constraints on borrowing may be There wasn't much discussion yesterday of housing, and I would just like think there are some concerns there. given that mortgage the demographic need for housing, obviously, is possible longer as beginning to bite more sharply.  That's an area that I have some concerns about.

of the details, box in Tealbook A, about to full employment.  That perspective says, in the labor force but who say they want a job now-so we are excluding the retired, the at the peak of the business cycle, so there are about 4 150 million.  In addition, time for economic reasons has risen from 4.6 million The labor market discussion was very interesting.  Without going into all let me just draw a quantitative conclusion from the discussion in the the possibility that we are now already close basically, that the long-term unemployed and those out of the labor force are no longer effectively putting any pressure on wages, for example.  A consequence of that, just to put some numbers on it, is that if you add together the number of long-term unemployed with those who are not disabled, and people currently in school-that comes to about 10 million people.  Those same two categories added up to 6 million million additional people now who say they want to be working and, by this theory, are structurally unemployed.  That's about 2.7 percent of the labor force of the number of people who are working part in 2007 to 7.8 million-that's another 3 million people.  So, roughly speaking, an implication of

January 28-29, 2014

past seven years, somewhere between 2½ and 5 percent of of labor resources. this Tealbook box story is that in the the labor force has become structurally unemployed, which, if true, is a tragedy, of course, as we have lost a huge amount would become structurally skills mismatch and changes in industrial composition, et cetera, in such there is a case for the Tealbook that the length of time out of work has led to atrophy of skills and lack of labor-force think that from a policy point cuts both ways.  On the one hand, if these people really are irredeemable, then much we can do about it, as sad as it may be.  On the other hand, if the issue really is a chance to get back into work and reacquire experience and skills, that would main point I want to draw here is that this important debate.  It does have very important quantitative implications for the labor of our economy. Now, it seems implausible to me that that number of people unemployed because of a period of time.  I don't think that that's what's happening.  If box, it is attachment, and that's what's causing the problem, in which case I of view this there's not giving them actually be an argument for more forceful policy.  The is a very force and for the future

couple more observations.  There was some discussion of our forward to it, which I'm sure will be a subject of much discussion around this in coming meetings.  I do think that, although our guidance is not the most beautiful thing it is working is that it First, there is the 'well past' the 6.5 percent 'well past' as meaning two or three criterion, especially if projected inflation remains below target.  Given inflation's pattern we have begun, I have just a guidance and modifications table in the world aesthetically, it is working pretty well.  And the reason I think really has, at this point, three prongs. unemployment rate, and the markets do seem to think of that quarters, roughly.  That takes you to somewhere in the middle of 2015.  Second, there is the inflation continual low level, that is another factor.  And then, finally, there is the

January 28-29, 2014

it, of measured reductions in asset purchases.  Given our statement not raise rates until a considerable period after that program has ended, that is also number of pillars in this guidance though we may not continue that we will creating an implication of somewhere in 2015.  So we have a at this point, which I think is what's keeping it pretty well tied down.  That being said, obviously, you will want to clean it up and provide additional explanation.  But for the moment, I think it's working okay.

The third paragraph announces a Treasury security and MBS on future policy decisions with to the balance sheet and the path of the funds rate in the fourth and fifth is essentially unchanged. The first paragraph of alternative B characterizes growth in economic activity as having 'picked up in recent quarters,' while noting that labor market indicators were mixed.  It also points states more emphatically that fiscal points to 'moderate' economic growth going forward; that characterization suggests that you do not see economic growth picking up further from its pace half of last year.

But given the decision in the purchase program, and persistently low inflation rates implies a reductions in the purchase program.  But MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I pointed out yesterday, because of the significant uncertainties about how to interpret recent data, a strong case can be made for alternative unemployment rate by providing significant monetary accommodation.  Despite the recent reduction in the unemployment rate, it still inflation is forecast to be below our target at our previous meeting to place us on a path of measured reductions though I personally would have preferred to wait, I can support alternative B at this meeting. However, I would note that the fact that we are not pausing despite a weak labor market report, recent correlated stock market declines globally, very high hurdle for pausing on the path of very gradual

is a very high hurdle for stopping or slowing the taper, there should then be a very high if there hurdle for tapering more quickly.

I am comfortable with taking the second tapering step, and I am likely form that $10 billion per meeting is the baseline above 6½ percent, I anticipate increasing public pressure for unemployment marker, we know the statement is going to have to change before language to use to 6½ percent.  On those questions, I am reluctant to put down another I would like to make a few comments regarding communications challenges ahead.  As long as the unemployment rate is more information on what 'well past 6½ percent' means.  And considering the proximity of the 6½ percent long.  We can see that coming.  We should think now as a Committee about the once we get

January 28-29, 2014

alternative A.  I would prefer to keep our explanation of the qualitative than quantitative, if that can be unemployment rate marker, as in Committee's reaction function post-6½ percent more done.

in the economy go-round, I think a falling unemployment rate may be satisfactory conditions in the labor market market within demographic groups do not speak very loudly on the of structural from cyclical factors.  As a result, I think there is more uncertainty than much of the decline reflects reduction level of the rate is consistent with full employment. As I said yesterday less reflective than we would like of increasingly when you view it holistically.  In my view, we just don't fully understand the factors driving the decline in the unemployment rate.  As the staff memo points out, the data on the inflows to and outflows from the labor separation usual about the path of the unemployment rate, about how in slack, and about what per se that resorting to a qualitative characterization of the conditions that would guidance, I think we should consider less in communications over the coming meetings and more weight every meeting supported by refreshed SEPs.  I say that with considerable empathy a communication strategy around the I recognize prompt liftoff carries risks.  Reliance on qualitative statements that are open to interpretation, both within and outside the Committee, risks some confusion and volatility in trading markets. To deal with the risks associated with qualitative relative reliance on the statement on other communications methods in our arsenal-namely, the SEP, press conferences, and the minutes.  I think there might be value in reopening the question of enhancements to the SEP.  I will also support the suggestion of President Bullard, I believe, and others to go to press conferences for our new Chair [laughter], given the singular and concentrated burden of press conferences. The Committee has time to deliberate about the design of

January 28-29, 2014

am raising the issue now to urge work on these concerns, I hope, well before coming meetings.  I we get to the 'well past' period.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Well before 'well past.'  Okay.  President Plosser. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.

the challenges, in coming meetings.  I think the going to be, at least, that there is a reasonable likelihood that our 6½ percent challenge we reach that threshold and are still in a position of trying to ease policy by continuing to We will not have completed the asset purchase program by then.  I think that is with some challenges for communication.  And, indeed, while there are risks things could turn bad again, there are also risks that things could turn much better faster than that as well. MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I can support alternative B today, but I do think, as President Lockhart suggested, and as Governor Stein suggested yesterday, that one of the things that we need to be doing is looking beyond the decision today to particularly communication challenges, we are going to face challenge is threshold will probably be met sooner than we originally anticipated.  There could be a if purchase assets. going to present us that we anticipate.  I think we have to worry about turns out to be somewhat better than the Tealbook forecast.  What how our communications and if we are still buying assets problems.  Some may say, 'Well, actually is no conflict because we haven't said we would do anything at 6½ percent, so we raise rates.'  But I think the language in the statement To put it a different way, suppose the alternative scenario offered in the Tealbook comes to pass.  Suppose the forecast kind of policy and communications will we have to engage in at that time?  They could be quite complicated.  I think that we need to be thinking ahead about policies will react in those circumstances.  In particular, I think that when we reach the 6½ percent threshold, we face two sorts of there will continue to buy assets and we will not is going to prove to be problematic.  We have placed a lot of emphasis in our statements on both

January 28-29, 2014

and the labor market in particular.  One of the risks we face is that-as us have said-if in fact the unemployment rate to be a better summary statistic for labor market conditions than we have been the better argument for keeping low longer, so to speak, is low inflation, not necessarily the unemployment problem or the is how to perhaps shift the we may not want to raise rates. the unemployment rate President Williams said yesterday, and others of turns out assuming, then we are going to find ourselves in a difficult position where we are putting too much weight on labor market conditions.  I actually think that rates labor markets.  So one thing we need to begin thinking about emphasis in our language about the reasons that the various rules put together targeting rule, zero bound.  Rates are positive in almost all those rules second quarter.  I would also add that most of those rules don't rely on the looking at the staff's measure of output gaps.  Clearly those are some sense, but they are not necessarily driven by the unemployment rate we're not constrained low, the zero bound won't Now, having said that, I would also note that if you look at in the Tealbook, by the second quarter of this year, for all but the nominal income we are no longer constrained by the except for one in the unemployment rate.  They are related in per se .  So I think we will find ourselves in a position in which the rules are telling us by the zero bound.  How are we going to behave?  That is going to present some communications challenges for us, and even though inflation will be be binding any longer.

will deal with that.  Our statement has become very complex, with many revising the statement going forward.  If continues to play out as in the Tealbook, or somewhere between that and the Again, I think this will be a communications challenge, and it's important for us to anticipate now how we moving parts, and I think we need to seriously consider the forecast

I want to encourage that we not just think about what we will do if things what we'll do if things get better than we anticipated and we will use or what kind of actions we will take in those circumstances. To summarize, get worse-we need to think about what kind of language Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Evans.

this point.  We will have more data in March, and we can further assess the of reductions at that time.  Currently, I do expect that and consistent with our communications so far. MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  I think a further $10 billion reduction in our purchase rate is appropriate, especially given all of our communications at appropriateness of this measured pace we'll probably continue to make $10 billion reductions at these meetings at least through June. That seems appropriate we've seen in the second half of last year.  But I do think that our ultimate focus As the unemployment rate gradually falls, we need We need for it to be more than just a forecast.  We need to inflation objective.  That comes out of a lot of economic analyses about the think that's something that we should fear.  In at our goal rate of 2 percent.  At else we risk a Japanese-type lack of I think it's important to There should be a high hurdle for pausing, in view of the improvement in economic growth that should be on goal-oriented monetary policy. to see inflation increase to the target. actually see it begin to increase, and, frankly, I think we probably would benefit from slightly overshooting that most appropriate monetary policies, and I don't fact, it could help solidify longer-term inflation expectations some point we're going to have to actually deliver on that, or a relationship between long-term expectations and actual inflation.

It's not a critical element, but it could be might be facing. demonstrate that our inflation objective is not lot of dithering about beneficial for vanquishing the zero-lower-bound demons that we with your commentary about the current configuration of our the funds rate will most likely stay at zero 6½ percent, interpretation of our forward guidance.  We're going further consideration of that. Mr. Chairman, I agree statement.  Communications do seem to indicate that into 2015.  I think that it's a useful package.  Still, as the unemployment rate falls to we're going to have more challenges to the to have to take

is certainly better than the 8 percent that we were very high number, associated typically with a nasty, recession-level 1 percent and it's been low for quite some time. A 6½ percent unemployment rate looking at back in September 2012 when we undertook those actions, but we shouldn't forget that 6½ percent is still a outcome.  So we shouldn't pat ourselves on the back too much just because we're getting that, especially when inflation is at better describe our reaction-function relationships among inflation, of when consensus.  I do think that it is going to feel squishy when We need to somehow labor variables, and GDP growth.  That will continue to be a challenge for us in terms the liftoff will be.  As President Lockhart mentioned, I suspect that a qualitative description is probably what we're headed for as a we get there.  It might be the best that we can do, but we won't be completely satisfied with that.

I think SEPs as a The consensus-forecast exercise was just thoroughly discouraging to I want to address a couple of things possibility that we could use SEP enhancements to help provide more guidance on our confusion-communication [laughter]-that was we're going to be disappointed when we go about trying to enhance our communications vehicle.

That's the kind of thing that we would really like to have-a more unified assessment of our right assumptions that we would jointly carry a forecast.  So I'm not optimistic that we're going to be successful. monetary policy assumption, that's going to the different policy assumptions that each of us are making but end up producing similar how the public is going to disentangle that Stan Fischer, the Board's me. forecast-and we could not even agree on the around in order to get to When we have to come back to the appropriate garble outcomes, and I've never been able to figure out usefully.

I thought President Lacker did a economic growth we've seen might be temporary. a false dawn, I think the Committee is actually well positioned.  This is the mindset that it if necessary.  So I think we're well positioned pace that it hit in the second half of 2013. MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have just a few brief comments on challenges beyond today for this Committee.  I think the key issue for the Committee, as outlined yesterday in our remarks about the we've had a good job of outlining the case that some of the If it is we've had in designing current policy.  We have a leisurely tapering baseline, I would say.  We have expectations of the first increase of the policy rate far in the future, and we have a tapering program that's state contingent, so we can alter in the case of economic growth slowing from the on the other case-What if this is not a false dawn, if it's the comments yesterday and President this morning.  I think we're less well positioned for this case. response in this case would be to increase the pace of tapering, but this would, rate increase.  That would be okay if it I'm going to concentrate real thing?-and follow up on some of Governor Stein's Plosser's comments earlier Probably our best in effect, pull up the entire time line of the first policy was warranted by stronger data, but that's what we would be doing in that situation.

a key challenge for the Committee in this scenario in 2014, which is the possible Let's suppose we do not face a false dawn.  Instead we face the real thing, a faster economy that is on a sustainable growth path.  My main comment is going to be to outline my version of emergence of the idea that the FOMC is 'behind the curve.'

has noted yesterday and today that our suite of Taylor-type rules now the policy rate should be rising off zero either now or in the near future.  I'm going as a key fact because I take these Taylor-type rules to describe normal FOMC President Plosser suggests that to take that

January 28-29, 2014

by the research literature.  So let's divide the period of a near-zero rate into two parts.  The first part is the one in which the actual policy rate is near zero and rules also recommend zero.  This is the world that we've been in over the past is what we're used to thinking about recently.  And then there's a different actual policy rate is near zero, but the Taylor-type rules recommend more we're entering into now.  In previous discussions around the table here, 'Woodford period.'  We're now entering this Woodford period, it as a very challenging period for the Committee. behavior as characterized policy Taylor-type several years, and this world, in which the than zero, which is what I've called this second part the and I see made promises to keep the policy rate lower for credible commitment by this Committee to keep rates lower for longer.  Instead, macroeconomic prospects in the United States.  Financial markets expected rates During the pre-Woodford period, we longer.  One interpretation of those promises, and maybe the one I favor, is that they did not represent a these promises were interpreted by financial markets as representing a pessimistic outlook for medium-term to remain low, indeed, but only because the economy was expected to remain weak.  This created an equilibrium of sorts between the Committee and financial markets.  We've been in this equilibrium-a word I use loosely here-for some time.

Woodford period, and such an interpretation by Taylor-type rules representing so-called normal than what's observed.  The Committee intends to The Committee will, exactly at this point-that is, in 2014-begin to is supposed to work in the Woodford model is that you made the ago, and you got a boom three years ago because you made Now we're going to move into the financial markets will no longer be possible. Fed behavior will call for a higher policy rate keep the policy rate low. gain credibility for its lower-for-longer policy.  This may, in fact, feed a boom in the U.S. economy.  The way this promise a long time ago, three years

It was interpreted as a pessimistic are diverging from what we're policy rate, financial markets are going to say, 'Well, they really do will come today instead of when it was supposed Financial markets' interpretation of what we're doing is going to have in 2014.  Likely what they will do is argue that the FOMC is 'behind the curve,' typical thing that occurs in financial markets, and they'll just point to simple evidence the Committee isn't following Taylor-type rules that are calling for higher policy rates.  So in which the FOMC has lagged behind where markets it should be. that promise.  I'm arguing that that promise wasn't credible. outlook for the U.S. economy.  But now, when Taylor rules actually doing with the mean to stay lower for longer,' and the boom to come three years ago. to change which is a that it's going to sound like past episodes thought possibly a major challenge for the Committee in 2014.  The Committee will economic data.  You can argue that the economic data aren't as strong as they appear than the markets think it is, and you can have that financial markets.  That's fine, but that gets difficult at some point if the data really we could make is that this is a Woodford follow-through.  We 'lower for longer.'  That means that the reason we're keeping policy low today is to make up for the period when we were constrained by the zero bound.  I do that is one argument that good plan right now about how we're going to this.  We need to hone our message during in which I think this is need to have a story to counteract this.  There are simple stories that can be told.  You can lean against the to be, that the economy is actually weaker debate with are coming in stronger than anticipated.  There's only so far you can go in making that kind of argument.  Another argument that made a commitment to rates not see enough consensus on the Committee to make that argument, but could be made.  So I don't think we really have a handle this in 2014, and we need to think about coming meetings to handle this possibility.  Of course, this is all under the scenario

January 28-29, 2014

growth is actually faster and sustainably faster, not under a scenario in which the economic economy slows down again.

would remind everybody that inflation is actually included in the TaylorSo the fact that those rules are calling for liftoff already incorporates the fact that is somewhat away from our target on the low side. By the way, I think low inflation is helpful.  It does give us some cover, and that's a big advantage for us, but I type rules. inflation

our forward guidance has paragraph 5 is about to reach its expiration date in the reference unemployment.  The quantitative forward guidance in that paragraph as amended guidance has succeeded in bringing market own views, but much of this paragraph is explicit or implicit reference to the 6½ percent threshold. Like President Evans and many others, I agree with you that been very successful, but clearly to 6½ percent and bolstered with strong qualitative post-threshold expectations about liftoff into alignment with our written with already have, once we've seen the January data.  So I think we need to rewrite the the coming meetings,' and I don't think that is realistic. And I just want to mention that we could easily reach that threshold very soon.  Perhaps we actually forward guidance for the post-threshold world as soon as possible.  I agreed with President Lockhart's comments, but he said 'over I think it has got to be between now and March that we really think about this, given that unemployment could be down below 6½ percent very soon.

So it would be helpful to see options around both of these of our next meeting.

She had is by as personal honor.

We had to memorize every word in that book, and we want to pull attributed to John Paul Jones, the father of the Navy.  It turned out he had a actually written it, but nonetheless, it's attributed to a great leader.  What he said was, 'It no means enough that an officer of the Navy should be a capable mariner. . . .  He should be well a gentleman of liberal education, refined manners, punctilious courtesy, and the nicest sense of clarity.' the entire predecessor, every one of those words applies to the way you have run this Committee. Obviously you're not only a mega-capable economist, but you have shown punctilious courtesy -I can't remarkably short period of time-and I don't know anybody with a nicer sense of personal honor.  There's no one in this town who has humility.  You have great power and great influence, but you've shown incredible humility, which is an example for anybody here in Washington.  And as to patience and kindness and also firmness, you have shown those to me personally, and I just want to thank you for it.  I honor else at this table.

Plosser makes a very good point that we should be prepared for the economy perhaps doing better than we are naturally cautious about.  I want to keep the book open for doing more as we go through time.  We my view, as soon as is practicable.

to make some comments picking up on what some others have said here with intermediate-term policy implementation and forward guidance.  One of the reasons I effective was not just because it was an expression of it to the forward guidance, and I've spoken So I'll just make some brief comments.  I very much welcome Bill English may already be there, or we're to it.  I think it's important that we give urgent and new and serious thought to the nuts and post-liftoff conduct of monetary policy and what our post-liftoff tactics will be. I would like regard to think that what we announced was confidence in the economy, but also because we tied about that quite a bit. and Simon Potter's promise of additional work on intermediate-term policy implementation.  I think President Evans raised a very good question about unemployment approaching our 6½ percent threshold-and, to President Williams's point, we close bolts of the a little bit longer than me, and Janet has been here longer, but I want to remind the Committee again that our balance is substantially larger and has a substantially longer duration.

Madam Governor, about to be will be our greatest challenge, and we can talk about the Taylor rule and the us, but I think the key point is that we need to do a great deal a very open mind about the form that our post-liftoff strategy and think there's plenty of room for more staff analysis, and I agree Our chances of successfully negotiating the minefield improve if we have a carefully thought-out, well-articulated post-liftoff Chair, this Woodford period and what they tell of work here, and I have forward guidance could take.  I with President Williams-the sooner the better.

when speaking about you, Mr. Chairman-I Vice Chairman Dudley mentioned time path is not a strategy, although Governor Stein reminded us that whether we things in terms of time or not, that's the way market operators work.  Publishing or Committee-agreed funds rate projections may have its uses, but I think we have to it's no substitute for articulating a policy strategy, and I look forward to there are limits to invoking 'this time is In the spirit of humility-which I referenced humbly offer a couple of comments and guidelines.

As the economy continues to balance sheet also continues to grow, and the market's ability to price risk and desired influence of investment, job and income growth, and inflation continues to puzzle. Even with these steps I remain concerned about others expand, our allocate credit remains highly influenced by monetary policy, while the policy on business is now pushing accommodation past the advice of multiple policy Tealbook inflation remains a caution, all of these rates incorporate the 2 percent I also note the increase in the Tealbook-consistent estimate of policy is now more accommodative than at the time of the previous meeting.

that it is important for us to continue to work on our the March meeting and engage in that discussion.  Thank you, Mr. As a result, I agree with others communications and to adjust the forward-guidance language as soon as our March meeting. And I plan to be here at Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker.

enjoyed my policy lectures-I mean, statements of your final meeting, to reviewing and recapitulating the my recommendations and commentary about how to conduct monetary policy. I have written a throwback statement consistent with the theme evinced by the many that were given to you last night.  My policy statement is in the style Chair-to-be noted last night, the MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Knowing how much, over the eight years we have served together, you must have [laughter]-I gave thought, in honor highlights of Instead, throwback baseball caps that was common under your predecessor, when, as our Chairman spoke first on policy matters and the policy go-round was noted for its brevity.  So here goes:  'I support your policy proposal, Mr. Chairman.'

[Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That was refreshing.

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Better late than never, right?

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.

willing to support alternative B.  As others have noted, 6.5 percent, I believe it will be important in the near term to for the fed funds rate.  So I'll spend my time talking about potential that we could be thinking about for March or April.  I'll be giving some regarding what I see as the main lessons learned about communication in 2013.  I think MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I am going to deviate from the example set by President Lacker.  For today, Mr. Chairman, I am with the unemployment rate nearing change our forward guidance changes in the language context

January 28-29, 2014

is important because my lessons learned will deviate from the lessons learned by table, and I think that's leading us to different conclusions. this context others around the the beginning of 2013.  We had the end of the asset purchase program, with a key as substantial improvement in the labor market outlook.  We also had communication in place about the evolution of the fed funds rate.  Now, when I look the latter, quantitative communication was more effective. We had two kinds of communication in place at qualitative communication in place about marker being described quantitative back at 2013, I see that

qualitative communication about the asset purchase program created two significant market outlook' evolved in ways that we could not control, and the especially given the fall in the unemployment rate that has actually transpired. led to a very bumpy ride in financial markets in the middle of the year, and I think we it did not end up having broader economic impacts. The and related problems for us.  First, market expectations about the meaning of 'substantial improvement in the labor ultimate size of the program ended up being much larger than most or maybe even all of us anticipated, Second, and relatedly, the Committee ultimately had to disappoint financial markets.  That process were quite lucky that communication worked well over the course of 2013 to pin expectations in June and think it's reasonable to attribute that blip entirely to communications challenges purchase program.  And we were able to work through that blip and own because we had the quantitative guidance course of the year, I would say markets remained convinced that the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent. In contrast, the fed funds rate down market expectations.  There was a slight blip in fed funds rate July, but I associated with the asset bring market expectations in alignment with our in place to refer to.  So over the we would not raise rates until

January 28-29, 2014

unemployment rate as a and, I guess, regret having used it in the first place because the unemployment publicly-that it might well be true that the unemployment rate is sending But I think it's critical to distinguish between thresholds and triggers is a very strong argument against using any particular metric, and, in particular, U-3, we explicitly retained optionality against kind of contingency.  We didn't put a trigger in place saying that we were going to as that measure A number of people have expressed concerns about using the threshold marker rate is providing an overly optimistic reading of labor market health.  That is an opinion I have certainly expressed too optimistic a signal. here.  This the unemployment rate, as a trigger for raising the fed funds rate.  It underscores the importance and the strength of the threshold approach, where exactly this raise rates as soon as unemployment fell below 6.5 percent exactly because we were concerned about the possibility that, in fact, the labor markets might not be as strong indicated.

monetary bound really requires a quantitative approach to forward guidance.  And qualitative approach that we laid out in until it market volatility and to have a approach in place that will pin down expectations to begin with. So the lessons of 2013 have convinced me-anew, I would say-that effective policy at the zero lower I agree with you, Mr. Chairman-right now, the December is working effectively.  But it's something that is going to work effectively doesn't work effectively, and then we are going to have to try to deal with figure out ways to do so on the fly, as we ended up doing in 2013.  I think it's better quantitative communication really ignores what I would consider the Tealbook A?  Or the unemployment rate has fallen below 6 percent, as in Tealbook B?  I'm we saw with the LSAP program last year, it is going to be increasingly Right now, I think our current lessons learned from 2013.  Does 'well past the time' mean nine months, as in does it mean until concerned that, just as

January 28-29, 2014

us to manage public expectations about the meaning of this statement as the difficult for unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent, as we all begin, in our own separate communications, to opine on what the meaning of that statement is.

threshold approach definitely has its drawbacks, and if you wanted is important in communication not to the perfect be the enemy of the good.  Market participants have, I think, grown to understand 6.5 percent.  I'm sympathetic to some of the comments Okay.  I have argued strongly for quantitative language.  What kind of quantitative language should we use?  The me to argue on that side, I could point to drawbacks.  But it let the threshold approach.  And I think it offers us a good mix of commitment and optionality.  For these reasons, I think a good starting point for consideration is that, in March, we should be committing to keep the fed funds rate extraordinarily low at least until the unemployment rate falls below some threshold lower than that President Plosser made about maybe putting a little more weight on the inflation rate, and I'll come back to that in a second.

that to move thresholds downward, which was a little bit of a surprise to me before us.  But it is clear the Committee has that sense. low enough that we don't see a substantial argued there are lowered our estimates of the long-run mandate-consistent unemployment to a year ago.  For both of these reasons, I would prefer 5.5 percent. Now, what threshold, exactly, should we be picking?  One thing I learned in 2013 is we are very reluctant because I viewed that as always an option So when we do adopt the threshold, it should really be chance of later wishing it were even lower.  In the economics go-round, I have good reasons to have rate relative think this comes back to where our as high as 6 percent.  I am suggesting keeping the fed funds rate Why wouldn't we adopt such a commitment?  I estimates of the long-run unemployment rate are.  Some participants have estimates of the longrun unemployment rate

January 28-29, 2014

falls below 5.5 percent.  Those participants could lead to undue pressures on inflation or risks stability.  So let me talk about how to deal with each of those possibilities in turn. extraordinarily low until the unemployment rate might be concerned that such a policy stance to financial actually think alternative A offers the right way to proceed on this. extremely low until the unemployment rate falls could lead by saying we are going to be keeping the federal funds rate is satisfied, and the first to two-year-ahead percent.  I'm perfectly happy to have that as the lead condition, because it fits in the outlook for inflation return to 2 percent.  That, in a guardrail.  If you are really worried about inflationary pressures, they should to two-year-ahead outlook for inflation.  The second condition would be, as the unemployment rate falls below 5.5 percent. In terms of inflation, I I'd say we should be keeping the fed funds rate below 5.5 percent.  We extraordinarily low at least until one of the following conditions condition could be that the medium-term outlook for inflation-the oneoutlook-is 2 with President Evans's view that one way to explain and articulate policy is through our goals. And we are going to wait until we actually see I think, puts show up in that oneI said, that

is one that we did not deal with when we laid out our first threshold should be dealing with now, which is that committing to this kind of strategy could to financial stability.  I think the right way to deal with this is to add a third clause-a third condition that would lead us to consider raising rates.  It would be a financial-stability knockout clause along the lines of the Bank of England'sthat would allow the Committee the option of raising rates if the Committee saw that sufficient benefits in terms of mitigating potential risks to financial So it would be very open-ended and would allow us, essentially on a meeting-byNow, the third issue and that we lead to undue risks knockout essentially language doing so would produce stability.

We can commit to medium-term outlook-the one- to two-yearthe unemployment rate has fallen financial-stability knockout clause looks like.  And I agree been said before-I think we have to move quickly.  I think March will be a very So that's my keeping rates extraordinarily low at least until the ahead outlook-for inflation has gone back to 2 percent, or below 5.5 percent, or whatever the with what's good time to do this.

And I think we should be working to make the statement an effective One last point.  I am sympathetic to President Bullard's desire to have a press conference every meeting.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Yellen.

to acknowledge, as alternative B does, that recent labor market indicators have been I sensed at the previous meeting that many of us consider the appropriate hurdle for process of winding down our asset purchases to be fairly high, and certainly this one MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  I think it's appropriate mixed.  But pausing the employment report doesn't cross that bar.

January 28-29, 2014

the is now in train.  I certainly hope that the two employment period will paint a picture that's unambiguously supportive meeting, I think it's appropriate to reduce the pace of purchases by another $10 billion Moreover, the information we have received concerning final demand suggests that strengthening we were expecting reports over the coming intermeeting of ongoing improvement.  With the inflation news having been roughly neutral since the previous today.

also think it's appropriate to make minimal changes to the statement. you noted, Mr. Chairman, that be working.  Market views currently seem well survey suggests that no changes in guidance are anticipated two strong employment reports-easily be in a situation in which percent threshold.  In that event, we will all of you who have the data end up being disappointing and we have anticipated or stronger than we have anticipated. For this meeting, I We strengthened our forward guidance in December, and, as guidance still seems quite relevant and appears to aligned with our own, and the dealer in this meeting.  But, as many of you have pointed out, we could, before our March meeting, or at itg-especially if we receive the unemployment rate reaches or crosses the 6½ absolutely need to make changes in our forward guidance.  I agree with urged that we need to think very hard about how to change the guidance quickly and that we need to be well positioned for either scenario, whether weaker than need to make decisions at our March meeting on how to modify 6½ percent threshold, we would list a broader in this discussion, and a very useful idea, that we could enhance our guidance with respect to inflation.  The So I definitely think we the guidance.  This is obviously going to be challenging.  You see in alternative A today one possible approach, whereby, as we approach the set of labor market indicators we would be watching, in addition to the unemployment rate. Obviously, there are other approaches to consider.  I have heard clearly think it's

January 28-29, 2014

indicate that projected inflation will factor into our decision on how long in its present range, but we could certainly consider ways to enhance our current guidance does to keep the funds rate emphasis on how inflation will matter to future policy decisions.

all of you to think very hard about concrete ideas that you have.  I plan to reach out in touch with me to offer up ideas that you have about the will try to use this intermeeting period to move forward on this, and I that work on this is absolutely urgent. Listening to the discussion, I've heard some very interesting ideas during this round.  I would urge to all of you.  I hope you will be forward guidance.  We agree

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.

I economy that I saw, but I did that, in part, in an to balance the discussion, which I thought, at least until Jeff and Bill and Janet began unduly emphasized the upside risks.  I do, however, agree that there are MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  Yesterday highlighted some of the downside risks to the effort to try speaking, had a little bit upside risks, and so I also subscribe to the Chairman's statement that risks are broadly balanced right now.

with those of you who have suggested that our action today will solidify there is a pretty high hurdle for departing from a $10 billion add another thought, which is that once we have solidified will, I as a pretty strong signal one way or another.  So that's probably a that there is a pretty strong presumption going relieving ourselves from every single FOMC meeting. I also agree market expectations and that reduction per meeting.  I would just those market expectations, any deviation from the $10 billion per meeting reductions think, be read by markets further reason to think from our own perspective in that this is the path we're on.  That's in addition to the reason of having to have the discussion at

January 28-29, 2014

agree with everybody else that we need to focus on the forward issue and need to be ready to roll it out, if not rolling it out, by the March meeting. And, finally, of course, I guidance Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Stein.

for all the that people have articulated.  I think we're on a good path.  I think policy is appropriately Market expectations are clearly in line.  Given where we have remarkable.  It seems like the market can't disagree about whether we're going to finish with a $15 billion reduction or reduce in October and $5 billion in December.  I think that to the extent that we can homogeneity and clarity, it is going to serve us well, because we've got all this MR. STEIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I also support alternative B, basically reasons calibrated to the fundamentals. been, the homogeneity now is just anything other than maybe by $10 billion sustain that complicated stuff around the guidance to deal with.  So I think that's very helpful.

people have made about the bar for that I think that's a good thing, but it's a we should keep on this path even if agree with President Rosengren that if the news bar for accelerating should also be very high.  A number of Mr. Chairman, as you said, right now the mechanical timing of the supporting our forward guidance.  We are about to possibly percent.  As Governor Tarullo said, there is lot of signal content.  Suppose we got to the next meeting with good $20 billion.  All of a sudden, we would have moved forward this to go down I just wanted to reiterate a point that a number of changing things being high.  And I want to emphasize symmetric thing.  It's not hawkish, as if we were saying that the news gets weak.  I want to emphatically comes in stronger than expected, the you have alluded to this. wind-down is an important pillar remove another one of the pillars as we cross 6.5 potentially going to be a news and we accelerated to mechanical aspect of liftoff by three to six months.  I would be very, very reluctant

January 28-29, 2014

of symmetry to financial-stability concerns.  If you worry a makes you careful going in, I think it has to make you that path.  And I think there's a sort lot about financial stability, and that careful going out, and you have to keep that balance in mind.

qualitatively.  I just want to just want to in the conditionality on financial conditions.  Again, it's symmetric in principle. that we get to a point where things detach a little bit and term premiums that, to some extent by slowing federal funds rate.  Do we want to allude to that theory that letting the market know that we would be leaning against that might tamp I don't know.  It's conceptually interesting.  I think it's hope it would be something that we could give On the guidance, I am in the camp that prefers doing things put one thing on the table-and I really don't have a clear view on the merits, but I lay it out there for discussion-which is whether, as we think about this, we want to have guidance some explicit But the worry I have is spike.  I suspect ex post , we would be willing to lean against that down the rate of increase of the ex ante on the possible down the volatility in the first place? worth discussing.  I don't have a clear view, but I a little bit of thought to.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I have made comments like that in press conferences, for example, and it was also one of the rationales for the non-move in September.

the rationale for the non-move in emphasize that a little bit more and hope that it has a bit of a MR. STEIN.  I was thinking exactly that was September.  Do we want to just preemptive feature?

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.

Governor Powell.

have comments on the statement and on the work we'll be doing for the March statement. MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, will support alternative B, and I a couple of

January 28-29, 2014

I didn't notice this until President Williams mentioned it, but I do think that saying mixed in the labor market will perhaps be the headline coming out of this.  It is a wonder-we have market expectations right where we want them.  I that it will send a signal that the Committee is First, indicators are signal of concern, and I don't have great certainty about this, but I worry concerned.  I'd rather not do that, so I like John's suggested change there.

likelihood of passing through 6½ percent is high. is going to need to be a pretty significant rewrite of paragraph 5 in this That is not something we should be point in the meeting in March.  I think there should be a lot of back-and-forth before think it's important to start by bearing in mind that me. Second, as others have observed, the So, obviously, there statement.  And I would echo what others have already said: doing at this then.  The purpose, of course, is to enable markets to understand how the Committee will react to changes in the economy and the markets.  I the markets have got it about right, right now.  There is a 'first, do no harm' message in there, it seems to a few of them, but really most of them-so that the case is what to do if neither inflation nor financial instability is suggested in the baseline.  If that is the case, then my strong it now.  I don't know whether that would be reflected in the statement a strong prior now is that this band of people that the Chairman added up at the there and could potentially be gotten back by a stronger I don't pretend to have all of this figured out by a long shot.  But I will just say how I'm thinking about how I would react to developments.  I think it's ideal to have a plan that covers most of the probabilities out there-not just market can react.  The first increased materially more than inclination would be to keep going and to lean in the direction of staying lower for longer. That's how I think about or not, but beginning of the meeting are out

January 28-29, 2014

financial-stability or inflation concerns, we and see whether that's the case. economy and stronger demand, and if we don't have ought to keep going question is, what if inflation reacts?  I think that in this situation-and this is In a stronger economy in which we were at risk of inflation breaking out-where there ceiling.  I don't really think that's where we are.  If past 15 years, where is it?  And I don't really expect inflation to react faster than don't know. So then the with financial stability not reacting-I would tend to support a symmetrical approach to inflation. was evidence of being near potential and inflation was on a hair trigger-I might well be somebody who would look at 2 percent as a you look at the is in the Tealbook, but I

case with which I am going to have a harder time is financial instability.  I think the case is that we have a reasonably decent economy, inflation doesn't do much, but the I don't faith in macroprudential policies.  I can learn that I'm monetary policy may have to react. The most likely bonfire is burning and asset prices start to move higher and higher.  What do we do then? come to this with a lot of preexisting wrong about that-I'm happy to.  But it seems to me language in paragraph 5 of Alternative A that Governor Yellen have a couple of comments, assuming that this is a stab at what it might look like. we put something in here, we need to be putting it in to tell the market how we are going signal we're sending by including the labor force in this list of things that we would consider.  Is it really that we are the level of the labor force participation rate-that it says to us that there is a them, to the Is that what we're saying, or are we saying that the labor force participation rate?  The notion would be that if Looking at the specific cited, I just First, if to react, and I'm not sure I understand what participation rate uncomfortable with group that is not counted in unemployment, and we are determined to go out and get extent we can, subject to the dual mandate? we'll react to further decreases in

January 28-29, 2014

has been, which nobody in this room wants it to do, how are we going that?  The first takeaway ought to be that we are actually closer to the natural rate of would go lower for getting a signal that we're closer to the natural rate of unemployment? On the other hand, if the labor force participation rate flattens little bit, that does say that there are people out there who will come back into love to evidence.  So I'd just say that if we are going to put that in message we are telling the market to take away. it keeps going down as it to react to unemployment.  But if it continues to go down, is the suggestion that we longer, even though we're I'm not sure that makes any sense. out and increases a the labor force, and that's a very positive message.  That's a message that, frankly, we'd get, and maybe that would provide there, we need to know exactly what notice, which I'll just raise now, is that we don't talk about wages costs. that was quite deliberate, knowing the process we go through.  But I think that might be any reaction from wages or from kinds, we would take that into consideration.  Thank you, And the second thing I here.  We talk about inflation pressures, but we don't talk about measures of employment I'm sure something worth considering that if we continue to not see employment cost indexes of various Mr. Chairman.

you.  Vice Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank

Chairman.  I favor alternative B at this few points I'd make. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. meeting.  There are a is that the data have been broadly consistent with continuing on the course that we the December meeting, but that shouldn't be a surprise.  It would be pretty surprising if set of data in this short period of time that caused us to totally revamp our forecast.  I the same path.  The taper decision in December markets.  The thing that struck me especially was that the forward One began at we got a don't think it's a surprise that we're staying on was very well received by

January 28-29, 2014

last FOMC policy now to do over the next year or two, and that the statement at a minimum at this meeting, which all seem to favor. short-term rate expectations remained very well anchored, unlike the situation that we saw summer.  Another positive, of course, is that market expectations about appear broadly consistent with what we actually expect really supports the idea of keeping changes to we others, though, that in March more substantial changes may be warranted. long and cumbersome, especially paragraph 5.  It seems to me that a that simplifies paragraph 5 would be helpful.  Second, as other people have said, there's a that we could get to the 6½ percent unemployment rate threshold by the March meeting.  If occur, I don't think a revamp would be optional.  It would be necessary, and so we around the when we come to the meeting mind and we know which way we want to go.  The third issue, of course, is that our in a meaningful way, too, at the March meeting, and that might a $10 billion per meeting taper rate and our 'well past another risk in terms of how our policy is going to evolve. I agree with First, the statement is quite rewrite risk that were to have to have a contingency plan for that.  I completely support what everyone else table has said, that we've got to start doing the work now so that we're of one SEP paths could change contradict the timing of liftoff implied by the time' line.  That's

that we should put more weight on inflation in our example, in paragraph 5 we could have language that was more explicit end of asset purchases, and that the amount of would likely depend to a significant degree below our 2 percent objective.  If it were further below our than if the gap was smaller.  We could in terms of our inflation forecast.  I think My own very preliminary thinking is forward guidance.  For in saying that liftoff is not likely until after the time between the end of asset purchases and liftoff on how far underlying inflation was objective, then we would be more inclined to wait longer do that in terms of actual inflation, or we could do that

January 28-29, 2014

to evaluate.  Putting more weight on inflation or the inflation those are two things that we need outlook would create an explicit escape route should slack in the economy tighten much faster than we think and inflation head up a little bit faster.

a pretty high different rate than $10 billion per meeting, because the signal from think that means we should just throw away this that either we should go faster or think the tool should still be available.  I can imagine that over a period of we really wouldn't be comfortable with a $10 might want to go faster.  So I don't want to put the thing on autopilot, it is a tool, and the point people have made is that the tool is actually really powerful. a really powerful tool if we needed to seems inappropriate to me. With respect to the pace of the taper, I agree with people that there's threshold now to go at a doing so would be pretty strong.  But I don't tool.  If data really come out on a consistent basis suggesting we should go slower, I six months data could accumulate in a way that billion a month pace and because To say we wouldn't use

I just want to reiterate what President Evans said about not putting Taylor rule's use of a 2 percent real interest rate intercept.  If you think terms of the fed funds rate target and the equilibrium rate, we're more than 3 percentage points below that supposed 2 percent equilibrium rate.  If our forecast, we have economic growth over the next year about 1 percent above bet if you went back historically and looked at the Taylor-rule relationship between economic growth rate you faster growth than just 3 percent.  I think it little bit more work on this to understand why, if policy really is rule seems to imply, we only have a 3 percent growth forecast.  Maybe that us tease out President Evans's point a little bit more.  What is the equilibrium real On the Taylor rule, too much weight on the about the distance between where we are in real you look at potential.  I where you were versus that equilibrium real rate and what subsequent got, you'd find that you would expect to get a lot would be useful to actually do a as easy as the Taylor would help

I'm the market are just going to mechanically pull out the Taylor rule, the 2 the Fed should be lifting off when, in fact, there are very good 2 percent.  It's considerably lower. rate?  To what degree are headwinds worried that people in percent real rate, and say that reasons not to, because the equilibrium real rate is not

It also feeds into also deviate in terms of markets I agree with emphasize them a little them to be, that's going to be relevant in terms of financial-stability concerns, because financial conditions could getting away from the upside, and we would presumably care about that as well.  So I think getting that into the statement somehow or into our discussion would be useful.

language as it is.  I don't think how we shade it is a big deal, but my read of the labor they were mixed. In terms of language, I feel like the labor market indicators were mixed.  I'm comfortable with the market indicators is that that 'great and good are seldom the same man.'  Well, I think you're a notable evening's remarks and in all the comments of everyone table over the past two days.  So on behalf of myself and the FOMC as Vice right person the right place at the right time.  Thank you. Finally, I want to say a few short words about Chairman Bernanke.  Winston Churchill once said exception.  I think you're both a good and a great man, and that's a broadly held sentiment among us.  That was evident in last around the Chairman, I want to thank you for your stewardship.  You have very much been the in

this question of the labor market sentence.  President Williams suggested 'on labor market conditions have shown further improvement.'  The status quo is 'labor preferences?  Do we want to take a straw vote? First is balance, market indicators were mixed.'  Are there any

past were coming in pretty strong, even though we got the bad number I'm not sure we want to say 'mixed' at this juncture-it might feed into market turmoil that's going on right now.  It is a little bit of a concern.  So I think it would be 'on balance.' MR. BULLARD.  I like President Williams's suggestion.  I do think that, over the several months, the indicators in the December report. the fair to say

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.

President Plosser.

that there if it's a description of what we thought on balance, I'd be inclined MR. PLOSSER.  I was going to say I agree with President Bullard and President Williams.  I think the formulation 'on balance' doesn't say anything to suggest weren't differing signals.  But to support that.

This is not by itself a particularly dramatic turn of events.  It's just evidence of continuing might have hoped for more definitive easing of pressures. very hard to predict these things.  It's actually reasonably typical in emerging market move by the authorities to be followed by some positive response, Now, what's also true is that subsequently it's for the situation to get a lot better as it is for it to continue to get worse. reverberations in a context where we Again, it's crisis situations for a dramatic then some retracing.  That's pretty common. almost as common

we don't know. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So is all by way of considering whether you want MR. KAMIN.  We don't know, and so this to put in a short reference in the statement acknowledging that.

Let me just say that a simple thing to do, if we were so and not change that.  That would be a simple thing to do.  But do you have a language CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. inclined, would be just to go back to the old risks language, 'having become more nearly balanced,' suggestion?

to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as nearly watching' or 'but developments in could pose increased downside risks,' depending on how firmly you MR. ENGLISH.  I think we have a couple of possibilities.  One would be, 'The Committee currently sees the risks balanced, but developments in global financial markets bear global financial markets wanted to point to the risks.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.

DUDLEY.  I would really be reluctant to react to what are pretty I just think that then it becomes a matter of the timing VICE CHAIRMAN small movements.  [Chorus of agreement] of the meeting and the timing of the event.  It gets over-weighted.  You know, if it happened

January 28-29, 2014

think it's too three weeks ago we wouldn't even be putting the language into the statement.  I small a move to react.

What's happened with the rupee and the and some of the other midrange emerging market currencies? MR. TARULLO.  Can I ask a question, Steve? real

In fact, at least as of 10:00 a.m., the Indian rupee and the Indonesian against the dollar. MR. KAMIN. rupiah are actually up slightly

MR. TARULLO.  That argues strongly for Bill's position.

KAMIN.  As is the Korean won.  So it is mixed.  As I say, it's not a great picture, MR. but it's not a terrible picture either.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.

markets.  I agree 100 percent with Vice in this fashion.  These aren't radical the potential of harking back to the Thai crisis, which Governor Tarullo MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, these are very thin Chairman Dudley.  I don't think we should be reactive moves.  There is mentioned earlier, but we don't see evidence of that right now, and I wouldn't want to appear reactive.

The only suggestion I would put out for consideration is, to go back to last month's existing CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. would be not to actively improve the risk balance-that language on the risk balance.

SEVERAL.  That's fine.

language that we would use, Mr. Chairman? alternative B, we would change the risk 'sees the risks as having become more nearly balanced' to 'sees the risks as nearly MR. FISHER.  But what is the CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  If you look at balance from

January 28-29, 2014

a change, and it's actually going in the direction of slightly less balanced.'  The fact is, that is risk.

three words. MR. FISHER.  You just drop those a sense of greater risk, but not a sense of less risk either.  President Kocherlakota. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I'm just putting on the table keeping that unchanged so that there's not

now that you've pointed out that that change was made, I have made it.  It's good to keep the language the same as much as MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Sorry.  Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I don't like doing that in response to the news received, but think it's better not to possible.  So I'm in favor of that.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.

DUDLEY.  Well, there's a question about what the meaning is here, more nearly balanced' means you're moving in the direction of VICE CHAIRMAN frankly.  Saying 'having become the risks receding.

It means relative to the recent past. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.

DUDLEY.  I know, but you can read it both ways.  I mean, it's not VICE CHAIRMAN obvious.  I can live with either.

MR. FISHER.  I can live with that one, Mr. Chairman.  I think that's wise.

just go back?  President Bullard. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  May we this is an improvement.  We said at the previous meeting, more nearly balanced.'  Now we don't want to say that we've made further MR. BULLARD.  I'm not sure 'having become improvement.

Right.  That's my point. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

MR. FISHER.  I don't think it's going to be noticed.

January 28-29, 2014

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  It will not be noticed.

relative to earlier that the risks were still to the downside. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It won't be noticed.  It will just be statements when we were saying

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I don't think it's a big deal one way or the other, Mr. Chairman.

you want to leave it, I'd leave it. MR. FISHER.  This won't be noticed, Mr. Chairman.  If intermeeting period, which isn't the meaning you want to convey. MR. LACKER.  There's a paradox here, because the way the language was, it referred to an improvement having occurred.  Repeating that suggests that further improvement has occurred over the

we're saying we're already there with the new wording.  I don't noticeable. MR. FISHER.  But now think it's

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think a lot depends on the reference point, which is vague.

us to refer to a change that occurred two ago rather than one.  I'd leave it the way it's written. MR. LACKER.  So it would be odd for intermeeting periods

DUDLEY.  I really don't think it matters one way or the other. VICE CHAIRMAN

privilege here and just ask going to be read any way other than repetition of our assessments last time. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  May I exert executive to put it back to where it was the last time?  I don't think it's as just a thoughts or considerations?  [No response]  If not, the only change did it go? showed further improvement.' Are there any other we have is the second sentence.  'Labor market indicators were mixed'-then how MR. LUECKE.
