YELLEN.  I'd like to begin by welcoming three people to the table today:  Stan Mester.  This is the first FOMC meeting for both Stan and meetings for We them. CHAIR Fischer, Lael Brainard, and Loretta Lael, but both have very deep experience in economic policy over many years in a variety of other contexts.  Loretta, as you all know, has actually been attending FOMC 14 years, but she joins us now as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. welcome our three distinguished colleagues and look forward to collaborating with them and to learning from items 1 and 2 this morning, which we will discuss in a need a motion to close The first thing we need to do is joint FOMC and Board meeting.  So with respect to the Board meeting, I the meeting.

FISCHER.  So it's always 'so moved'?  There's no variation? [Aside to Governor MR.

MR. FISCHER.  No variation.  All right.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  And then I say, 'Without objection.'  [Laughter]  Maybe our first item is a staff report on market developments and CHAIR there is an objection, but at any rate, operations.  Lorie Logan.

Chair.  Over the intermeeting period, market were focused on two ongoing themes:  the decline in longer-term interest and the low levels of volatility across financial markets.

As shown in the middle-left panel, on average, factors: changes in economic and policy outlooks in other advanced economies, and 'marketrelated factors,' which includes things safe-haven flows.  Changes to the U.S. economic outlook and the accumulation of U.S. dollar reserves were viewed as somewhat less important, although as you can see, a factor.

Under either option, the Committee could choose either additional indicator of money market conditions.

memo you received last week reviews the counterparty framework by each A second staff for overnight RRP operations.  As you know, the Desk conducts overnight RRPs with an expanded set of counterparties, including large money market mutual funds, GSEs, and a few depository institutions.  The share of take-up in our operations counterparty type is shown in the middle-left panel.  These counterparties were

However, the Committee may consider counterparty policy for other reasons.  In the memo you received, the staff discussed four possible approaches, outlined in the middle-right panel.  These approaches are not mutually exclusive.

the Committee could decide to defer any decision about the counterparty list if the Committee is concerned about of the recommend postponing action for short period of time, as a fixed counterparty list does not seem consistent discriminating among firms that can equally satisfy eligibility and to operational constraints.

For example, one standard reason to remove a primary dealer would be weak participation in operations, perhaps caused by a change in business model.

We will still learn just a little bit-we've got the to the 0 to 5 basis points, we could definitely MR. POTTER.

And I don't trying to explain changes like that to markets could be quite difficult, just as explaining change that 'We have tested it, it works great, and we are just going to shut it down until, learn more.  Right now-you can see in chart 14 that we don't know what would happen if we weren't restricted to the 0 to 5 basis points. think that we feel comfortable recommending a change just to test for what we might learn there, because the say, the middle of next year' would be a reasonably complicated thing to explain, given we have the authorization through January 2015.

MR. LACKER.  If I can follow up, Madam Chair.  Do markets view this as a permanent program at this point?

it will be a permanent program.  When we meet with the types of investors who use to have more clarity as to whether it will be a permanent program the issues that we face expect it to become a permanent investors have to be wary as to the decisions that you might take around this MR.

Chair.  I had a question about chart 17 on the answer to the question about expected number of months.  I had a concern this line of questioning could send the signal that the Committee is thinking about the off in terms of a time-contingent basis as opposed to a state-contingent basis.  I MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam exhibit 3, which is that decision to lift was wondering if the Desk had contemplated formulating this kind of question, either replacing or augmenting the survey by asking about changes in conditions that would lead to liftoff.

asked for economic conditions at liftoff.  We also asked-I'm just I've got this right-for the modal time of liftoff and the time at which you reinvestments to end.  Then, we took the difference between those two dates. MR. POTTER.  So we going to check that expect leading right now for us to ask for economic conditions really directly communicated that as that you choose for ending reinvestments, I think it would be a little bit consistent with ending reinvestments, because we haven't being one of the criteria.  If that is one of the criteria then we could definitely ask that question.

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I see.  So this is imputed from two different questions.  I didn't understand that.

MR. POTTER.  Yes.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Fisher.

Chair.  I defer my comments on panels 21, 22, and 23 into the discussion.  I want to come back to the Term Deposit Facility, because you memos about perhaps providing some flexibility there by rate.  And I just wondered, as you mentioned, Simon, if MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Madam until we get have mentioned we have had some allowing for withdrawal, but at a penalty you could give us a sense of the mathematics at this juncture as we contemplate this.

I'm going to pass that over to Bill. MR. POTTER.

MR. FISHER.  Bill, would you provide us with the mathematics, please?

what we described in the memo an annual rate on the amount.  So that would mean that if you term deposit immediately-when you got it, in effect-you'd be giving up the interest the week, if more expensive because you would be giving up the interest and you'd be paying 75 basis points for the whole week, in effect, rather than paying it just for the you needed the cash. MR. ENGLISH.  In terms of the breakability?  Part of was, for example, a fee that would involve giving up the interest on the term deposit and paying a penalty of 75 basis points at broke the and then paying the 75 basis points.  That would be something like using the term deposit at the discount window and getting a discount window loan at 75 basis points.  Later in you broke it, it would be also couple of days, say, that discount window, which you could do and borrow at the discount So we have in mind a pretty hefty penalty.  It's higher than the cost of using the term deposit as collateral at the window.  So we think there wouldn't be usage except in very, very unusual circumstances.

talking about the VIX and we're also issue caught my eye in terms of debt issuance has been growing very rapidly.  It is about 34 MR. FISHER.  Thank you.

What I was reporting was what we're hearing market participants focus lot about the low levels of volatility and the spread levels, in high yield, as we show in the chart.  I haven't been in conversations with them lot of staff work going into this and other areas.  It wasn't part of the conversations I've focused on these overall levels in these particular markets. MS.

Forgive me for taking up time on this, but you're less concerned about the MR. FISHER. CLO expansion domestically?

It's not like 2005 to 2007, when I think we ignored rest of the MR. POTTER.  Less concerned. some of the large growth in credit.  However, insight into what's happening in the

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Rosengren.

ROSENGREN.  I have two questions for Simon regarding eligibility.  The first one any nonbank SIFIs-AIG, Prudential, or GE Capital-have asked whether they have access to the ON RRP facility because they are supervised by the Fed, and money second question is that currently it looks like the SEC reform money market funds, do you would be sufficient capacity to run this facility with the government funds only? MR. is whether should market funds aren't.  And then the is going to go forward sometime in July.  But if it were for some reason to stall and we were to choose to only use government money market funds and not prime think there

June 17-18, 2014

To answer the first question, we've definitely heard from at least one of I think that is a different type of extended counterparty.  We could definitely do that. it's easier to have a very clear regime in place.  We could use the FSOC-if they a firm a systemically important nonbank institution, that could be one metric for doing MR. POTTER. those three. I just think designate that.

which shows you that most of the takemoney funds, and given that we have somewhere between 50 money fund industry, I think is is prime funds can invest in government-only funds.  So just excluding the prime funds have pretty quick access through the family of funds they're On the government funds-if you go to the chart up has been from the government and 60 percent of the assets under management in the government if we wanted to exclude the prime funds, we could certainly do that.  One of the things that true doesn't necessarily mean they won't in to the overnight RRP.

Though there may be a difference between treating somebody as a MR. ROSENGREN. counterparty and giving them access to instruments indirectly.

yes. MR. POTTER.  Definitely, there is a difference,

MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you.

Chair?

MR. FISHER.  May I follow up, Madam what we emphasized in the memos that we sent was there are really help for the reasons that Simon just gave.  They can still concerns about the business model of MR. ENGLISH.  I think two issues here.  One issue is the financial-stability issue, the kind of run-risk issue.  There, excluding the prime funds doesn't run.  They just run through an affiliated government fund, a government-only fund.  The other issue is the desire to send a signal, make a statement, about

June 17-18, 2014

money funds.  And that would be a separate reason not directly involving the issues prime surrounding normalization, but another policy point that you want to make.

There's another financial-stability issue which the memo highlights variability or volatility of take-up of the is much higher than that of the government funds.  If you have this individual cap tradeoff between volatility and where funds would essentially have a take-up that than if you included them.  Now of course, if the prime funds start putting MR. NATALUCCI. that you might want to consider and that is that the prime funds and the volatility of take-up is very high, you might see a you set the cap, essentially.  So excluding the prime is much less volatile money into the government funds, that might increase the volatility of the government funds, so the tradeoff is not obvious.

access.  So it could be part of the bargaining path or make the market more Sorry, President Lacker, a follow-up. MR. POTTER.  Also, we have to be careful because we don't know exactly how the prime funds use their competitive.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Fisher.

Chair.  I just want to follow up on Eric's point to So if we were to decide to exclude prime funds, closing the barn door.  You have 25 percent share of allotment problem to you? MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Madam understand the New York Desk's thought here. you're not worried about presently.  That would not present a

As I said in the briefing, we would attempt to restore the efficacy of the MR. POTTER. overnight RRP.  It's really a decision for you about that tradeoff.  At first, the efficacy would be lower without the prime funds, but over time I'm sure we can build that back up.

to follow up on President Rosengren's question as end of quarters.  Presumably, I'm guessing, there's some balance sheet there a usage variation in these for the prime funds and the government-only funds? MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you.  I want well, and I want to take a little different variation.  I think you were alluding to this, Simon.  If we stuck to government-only money market funds and excluded the prime funds, for example.  If I look across the quarter, look across the usage, one of the things that we've witnessed is this sharp uptake at the dressing that's going on by primarily the prime funds, or is periods when you've gotten these spikes sheet dressing by the prime money market funds.  It's invest a lot in European banks funds that they'll offer to the prime fund.  So one of the things that we've an increase in take-up in the overnight RRP.  That has meant that RRP market, haven't fallen that much because we've floor.  And we've improved market functioning relative to the repo markets in the It's a difficult window-dressing is so powerful and what it means for the regulations in that banks choose to window-dress so much. MR. POTTER.  It's not balance balance sheet dressing by the counterparties they would usually invest cash with.  So, for example, one of the issues with prime funds is they still effectively, and the European banks, as they get close to quarter-end, tend to reduce the amount of their balance-sheet seen at quarter-end is rates, despite this big flow of cash into the repo provided this United Kingdom, for example, over those month- and quarter-end periods. question as to why this place

CHAIR

MR. FISCHER.

YELLEN.  Let's move to our discussion, then, on policy normalization, and let make a few remarks, if I might, to begin.  First, I'd like to express my appreciation to all last meeting, and I very time and this time as well.  We to find CHAIR me just of you for the very engaging and productive discussion we had at our much want to thank the staff for their excellent support last covered a number of issues.  We considerably clarified the area in which we're likely consensus, and we succeeded, I think, in trimming down the range of options appreciably.

set a goal of time of the important deadline because I consider it essential for us to define We will also need to provide clarity about the mechanics of our approach in order As we resume our discussion today, let me remind everyone that we have clearly articulating to the public our normalization strategy and framework at the September meeting.  This is an concretely and communicate our plans well before the first steps in normalizing policy become appropriate.

market participants and to make sure that the required market to ease the transition for infrastructure is in place.

require our collective focus on some key remaining issues.  In that arise.  But it also needs to be enough that we can convincingly communicate it to the public.  Since interest a time when our balance sheet is quite large, there's broad the interest rate on excess reserves will be a central part of the rate Meeting this timetable will general, I think we've agreed that our normalization framework should allow us to deploy our mix of tools relatively flexibly to deal with contingencies simple and clear rate normalization will begin at consensus that raising normalization process.

and I'd like to describe, based on our characterize as a centrist approach.  There seems to be broad, least some role it would help to provide a more reliable floor for short-term than would IOER alone.  Assuming that we do operate this facility during normalization, rates becomes an important issue, and at the Of course, there are also some additional issues, previous discussion, what I'd although not unanimous, agreement that the overnight RRP facility should play at in our normalization plans since rates the spread between the overnight RRP and IOER last meeting, I heard pretty widespread support for keeping that spread rather wide.

spread, perhaps in the points.  First, I think there is a general desire to preserve and the overnight RRP facility, there's a desire to keep that facility modest in size. We focused on two arguments that favor maintaining a significant neighborhood of the current 20 basis trading activity in the federal funds market; and second, given a range of uncertainties concerns about of important follow-on issues, which are memos.  In particular, we need to consider the role of the federal funds, in both the implementation and communication of monetary I hope we can make progress today on a number spelled out in the staff IOER, and overnight RRP rates

minutes or tomorrow's press conference.  However, by the end of the settled most of these substantive issues.  That would allow us meeting. It's probably not essential that we reach final agreements today.  Of course, if we do reach agreement on particular issues at today's meeting, we could convey such progress to the public either through the July meeting, I hope we will have to finalize a set of revised normalization principles at the September was a very good discussion and back-and-forth on the issues last that will help us all work through these complicated issues. We had what I thought time.  I hope that we can again make good use of the Q&amp;A period after the staff presentations to make comments and ask questions

go-round to make sure we hear everyone's views on the key today to allow a good deal of time for staff.  I We will also have a full remaining issues, and we have purposely started very early this discussion.  So with those introductory remarks, let me turn the floor over to the think Gretchen is going to begin.

Chair.  My colleagues and I will be that you will need to make as you develop your approach to will talk about considerations that might bear on your choice to the public, then talk about how you might choose to limit the financial-stability risks posed the Committee's options MS. WEINBACH. 2   Thank you, Madam referring to the exhibits titled 'Monetary Policy Normalization.'  We will focus on three key decisions policy normalization.  I of rates to use for setting the stance of policy and communicating it Fabio will by an overnight RRP facility, and finally Debby will discuss regarding the end of reinvestment.

as building blocks for a couple of approaches to policy I'll begin by summarizing the staff's reading of the perspectives that you provided during the normalization go-round at the April meeting.  Although you expressed preliminary views and made no decisions, there appeared to be areas of common ground.  Staff took these areas normalization that you may find broadly acceptable, though not yet fully specified.

just noted, in risks to financial stability from disruptive surges in take-up of financial stress.  As a result, you expressed interest in RRP approaches to policy IOER and overnight RRP rates, at least initially. your reservations about executing a on a regular basis. As shown in the top panel of your first exhibit, and as the Chair April, most of you envisioned using overnight RRPs in addition to IOER to help control short-term interest rates during the process of policy normalization.  This approach could entail RRPs during periods of imposing some limits on potential disruptive surges of take-up at an overnight facility.  In addition, you generally expressed a preference for normalization that would not be expected to further reduce trading in federal funds. To support such trading, you could have an appreciable spread-such as the current 20 basis point spread-between the An appreciable spread would also help to address very large volume of overnight RRPs with money market mutual funds and other nonbank counterparties use of term deposits and term RRPs to drain could be helpful but many saw them as likely to be further it could prove useful to have them at to preserve flexibility the longer-run policy framework, and support for developing an expanded at the time of the September FOMC You held mixed views regarding the reserves; some thought such tools expensive or ineffective.  Even so, you generally did not wish to preclude development and testing of term tools because the ready if the combination of IOER and overnight RRPs does not work as expected. Two other common themes to your remarks were the desire about measure of the federal funds rate.  Finally, you generally supported informing the public about your updated normalization plans meeting.

incorporate these broad features, then, to play during is, do you want to set and communicate the stance of policy the federal funds rate, or by emphasizing the administered rates overnight RRP rate for the Federal Reserve's RRP counterparties. that rely on adjusting these two rates to manage short-term rates can be successful, whether they focus primarily on the federal funds rate rates. If you wanted to consider approaches that as noted in the middle panel, one key design issue is the role that you want the federal funds rate (or, as Simon discussed, an expanded version of that rate) normalization-that primarily by targeting on overnight RRPs and IOER?  Either way, you'd be using a variant of a floor system to implement policy, one with two floor rates-the IOER rate for depository institutions and the We think approaches interest or on administered the federal funds rate the rate is familiar to the public, so your communications should be well making a change could risk complicating policy communications during in the As noted in the bottom panel, you might want to target because understood; normalization, when clear communication will be critical.  You may also be inclined to use the federal funds rate now because you want to leave open using it longer-run policy approach after normalization is complete.

as it did prior to the financial target range.  Although current conditions in the federal funds market If the Committee chooses to target the federal funds rate during normalization, it would also need to decide whether to use a point target, crisis, or a

balances was in a point target may provide a in a With this approach, the FOMC would set a specific target level for the and direct the Desk to adjust the overnight RRP rate, perhaps close to the point target.  The Board would set the IOER rate at an appropriate the federal funds target.  Because entities with direct access to overnight rate below the RRP rate, an increase in the overnight RRP rate should put upward pressure in short-term unsecured funding markets and help to move the federal funds it falls below.  Similarly, reducing the overnight federal funds rate.  However, this untested.  As such, the Committee might also need to authorize the use of they prove necessary to hit target.  Even so, given the high level of reserves and the reliance level of the federal funds rate around the point target than was the case before it expects to be close to the point target on average over time, but not day. differ appreciably from those that prevailed when the supply of reserve much smaller, you might judge that the public would most easily understand a point target for the federal funds rate, and that changes clearer signal of adjustments in the stance of monetary policy than would changes target range. federal funds rate within a specified range, during the intermeeting period to help keep the federal funds rate spread to RRPs should not be willing to lend overnight in unsecured markets at a overnight on rates rate back up toward its target when RRP rate should put downward pressure on the approach is term reserve draining tools, on a contingent basis, in case the point funds rate on new tools, the Committee might need to tolerate, at least initially, greater volatility in the the financial crisis.  Thus the Committee might want to communicate that the federal funds rate necessarily each the Committee may want to use a target range for the federal funds as it does today.  In particular, as I just described, in current circumstances it point target for the federal funds rate with sufficient Also, if the Committee targets a range, the spread between the two likely could remain constant throughout the intermeeting period to adjustment, as would be the case if there is a point target. monetary policy and less RRP rate was took this approach, the Committee could begin to normalize range for the federal funds rate, and the IOER and RRP rates could be raised by the same increment, preserving their current how to react to situations in which range-for example, by making Alternatively, rate, may be difficult to hit a precision. administered rates rather than being subject Having a fixed spread between the two administered rates could be seen as desirable because it might be more efficient for the transmission of disruptive for money markets than the case in which the overnight adjusted regularly.  If it rates by announcing a higher target overnight spread.  However, given the level of reserves and the use of new tools, the accompanying increase in the federal funds rate could be larger or smaller than desired, and policymakers would need to decide the federal funds rate moves outside its desired target an adjustment to the administered rates.

of policy primarily through the overnight RRP and IOER top panel of exhibit 2.  If you took this approach, you could level of broadly similar amount.  You could even say that Rather than focusing on the federal funds rate, you might choose to set and communicate the stance rates, as noted in the announce a less accommodative policy stance by raising these two administered rates by the same amount, and the Committee could state that it expects the general short-term market rates to rise by a

federal funds rate attention on that rate without targeting it. market rates were to move temporarily outside of their the range would not be the primary focus of communication, pointing to the funds rate would probably reduce that leeway.  Of course, market rates were persistently outside the Committee's desired range, you expect short-term rates including the to rise by a broadly similar amount, if you wanted to focus some Communicating through administered rates may afford the Committee greater leeway to take no action if short-term expected range, since though also if short-term then some additional adjustments in the administered rates would be necessary, perhaps even during an intermeeting period.

overnight facility.  The tighter the caps on take-up at the facility-that is, the more control over shortmarket interest rates.  In general, the degree of control that the ON RRP facility over short-term market interest rates has implications for your the effectiveness with is transmitted to longer-run rates and real activity. Finally, as noted in the last panel, the efficacy of your chosen approach will depend in part on your decisions about how tightly to limit take-up at the RRP frequently they bind-the less the facility can be expected to exert term is expected to have decisions about your communications strategy, but also for which the stance of overnight rates discuss approaches to limiting disruptive surges in take-up at the as its total size. Fabio will now ON RRP facility as well

review design RRP facility.  These mitigants are the subject of one of the memos intermeeting period. MR. NATALUCCI.  Thank you, Gretchen.  In my remarks, I will features and other mitigants that could lessen financial-stability concerns associated with an overnight you received over the top left panel of exhibit 3, the memo focuses on caps on usage circuit breaker during a period of market stress.  These caps are not and a short period, which could be and nonfinancial and to additional responses are warranted. As indicated in the as a form of intended to limit average take-up at the facility under normal market conditions are expected to bind only rarely.  Instead, these caps are designed to prevent a disruptive surge in take-up at the facility over associated with a loss of short-term funding for financial institutions firms, and to provide policymakers with some time to assess conditions determine whether

memo identifies two main possibilities for the design of breakers:  individual caps-that is, caps specific to each reverse repo maximum at the facility each day.  An aggregate cap instead would allow produced by this process would be auction rate As noted to the right, the circuit counterparty (or RCP)-and an aggregate cap on potential facility usage.  The main benefit of individual caps is that each RCP would know in advance the amount it can invest greater flexibility for allocating usage across RCPs, and could be accompanied by a market-based pricing mechanism-such as a uniform-rate auction-to allocate takeup when the cap is binding.  Ordinarily, the rate the overnight RRP rate set by the Committee, but when the cap binds, the could be lower.

that apply to both individual and there is a take-up limit that cannot be in advance usage over equal to previous average usage The Committee may consider additional features aggregate caps.  Caps can be rigid (so that exceeded) or flexible (where the limit could be exceeded, perhaps at a lower rate, when demand exceeds the stated cap).  In addition, caps can be static (set and unvarying) or dynamic (adjusted periodically according to a predetermined algorithm).  Finally, dynamic caps could be set equal to previous average some period plus some amount (so additive) or multiplied by some amount (so multiplicative).

and disadvantages features, the Committee may find it useful to consider a on three of them. As indicated in the middle left panel, in assessing advantages of these possible design number of issues.  A table in the memo summarizes these various considerations.  In this briefing I will focus the two policy goals of controlling potentially The often bind could virtually eliminate rates, but allowing potentially disruptive surges into the facility. from the overnight RRP exercise to date indicates that individual take-up take-up, so it may be difficult to set aggregate usage.  This observation suggests that an aggregate cap may be in balancing the two policy goals, if accompanied by a pricing mechanism to facilitate a market-based First, how to effectively balance disruptive surges in take-up and setting an effective floor on short-term rates. caps should not be too tight:  Very low caps that surges into the facility but would diminish its effectiveness in controlling rates.  By contrast, very high and loose caps would have the opposite outcome, improving control over Evidence varies proportionally much more than aggregate individual caps that provide enough flexibility without leaving considerable room for a surge in more effective than individual counterparty caps especially allocation of overnight RRP when the cap binds.

cap with a uniform-price to allocate awards when the cap binds as well as a uniform system of more complex in which the rate on the overnight RRP declines specified schedule-would require a potentially make changes to Desk systems.  With respect to burden rate that may vary.  As a result, this option may be perceived as RCPs to Second, ease of implementation and burden on RCPs.  Current Desk systems could handle in a robust and automated fashion an aggregate auction individual caps.  However, implementation of some other possibilities-for example, a system with aggregate take-up according to a significant amount of time to on RCPs, an aggregate cap paired with an auction would require RCP bids to include both a quantity and a somewhat more burdensome than current operations, which only require submit a quantity and confirm the specified ON RRP rate.  However, when the aggregate cap is not expected to bind, the problem faced by RCPs would be no more complex than it is now.

communication issues.  Overall, simpler options would undoubtedly be rigid aggregate cap Finally, easier to communicate.  Static, uniform counterparty caps, as currently used, would probably present the fewest communication challenges, but a would also be straightforward to describe.  The use of dynamic caps might present some communications challenges, at least initially.  Advance communication of rules

Committee might want to focus the use of individual rigid caps that are range range between $50 billion and $300 billion.  Each day, the Desk with a maximum RRP rate set by the Committee; because demand cap amount, RCPs would almost always be able to invest the RRP rate. In light of the considerations outlined above, the today's discussion on two options, highlighted in the panel to the right.  The first option-an individual cap option-envisions adjusted periodically based on past usage.  For example, an RCP's cap could be set each month to its average take-up over the previous month plus an amount in a between $1 billion and $5 billion.  The rate paid is the overnight RRP set by the Committee.  The second option-an aggregate cap option-involves an aggregate rigid cap that is adjusted periodically based on past usage.  For example, the aggregate cap could be set each week to the average take-up over the previous week plus an amount in a would conduct a uniform-price auction for the cap amount allowable bid equal to the overnight would rarely exceed the amounts that they have requested and receive the announced overnight bottom panel, the wide range for the additive factors in these RRP facility effective in firming rates but also low choice of the additive factor. As indicated in the proposals reflects the difficulty of evaluating the tradeoffs between having caps set high enough to make an overnight enough to limit potentially disruptive surges.  Both components of the tradeoff are uncertain, and more staff work during the testing phase would be needed to help inform the Committee's

RRP in their own pressures. The Committee may want to consider whether setting caps so that they may bind occasionally-for example, at quarter-ends-could have salutary effects. Occasionally binding caps may reduce pressures for changes in rules when caps do bind because market participants would become familiar with procedures, expect them to be followed, and temper their reliance on overnight contingency planning.  On the other hand, caps that bind, even rarely, in normal times could also have costs-for example, by constraining the facility's ability to accommodate quarter-end automatically could result in a very size during protracted periods of stress as the effective limit ratchets its disposal to ameliorate injecting liquidity back into the system, several factors could limit of these tools or temper the willingness of policymakers to use them. want to impose an ultimate limit on facility usage as a caps.  For example, it may set an overall facility limit of work would be needed to calibrate this In addition to the risks associated with a sudden surge in take-up, the Committee may be concerned that dynamic caps that adjust large facility upwards, an outcome that could lead to further disruptions in funding markets.

The want to consider whether additional actions to mitigate strains would cap, or provide liquidity. In the event circuit breakers are 'tripped'-the Committee may face pressures from constituencies.  RCPs facing strains in funding markets Committee may be warranted in such situations.  For example, the Committee could lower the overnight RRP rate, adjust the now talk about reinvestment options. Debby will

meeting indicated that ceasing or reducing reinvestments would of normalization, and would be followed by the target federal funds rate; agency securities would likely be sold that.  Several important changes-noted in the top-right panel-have the sale of shorter-dated Treasury securities holdings it no longer expects to sell agency MBS during rates a large balance sheet. As noted in your top left panel, the exit principles included in the minutes of the June 2011 FOMC likely be the first step in the process modifications to forward guidance, reserve draining operations, and only then an increase in sometime after occurred in the three years since.  They include a substantial increase in securities holdings and excess reserves; during the Maturity Extension Program; changes in the forward guidance; the Committee's indication that normalization; and the development of overnight RRPs to help control interest with in line with the staff's in that case, the choice does not materially affect the macroeconomic outcomes, nor does it have a discernible effect on the Treasury.  That said, to the extent that the flow of rates-a possibility that is not factored into models but which some market participants appear to put weight on in the MBS halt in reinvestments may put some upward pressure on MBS which could pass through to primary mortgage rates. As summarized in the next panel, if the economy evolves baseline expectations, halting reinvestments six months before liftoff, at liftoff, or sometime after liftoff has relatively limited effects on estimates of the term premium and balance sheet.  Accordingly, timing of liftoff or projected remittances to purchases might have an effect on interest staff market-announcing a rates,

timing an strategy-before liftoff, after ceasing reinvestments prior to level of reserves prior to liftoff.  In the reserves are drained to a lesser degree (both in dollar terms As noted in the middle-right panel, there are several possible options for end to reinvestments as part of a revised normalization liftoff, or coincident with liftoff.  All else equal, liftoff-the first option-would normalize the size of the balance sheet sooner than in the other options and would slightly reduce the staff's current baseline,

than the staff originally projected in mid-2011. reductions in security holdings are a means for removing policy judged that conditions were appropriate to begin to tighten and as a share of the balance sheet) Because even passive accommodation, the Committee would presumably stop reinvesting principal payments only when it policy.

If you decide to end reinvestments after for stopping reinvestment. However, if you are concerned that reductions an unpredictable effect on interest prefer to maintain reinvestments until sometime after liftoff-which is a second option.  You also might prefer initiating policy normalization with an increase in your target for short-term use short-term interest rates as your primary tool for adjusting policy.  Moreover, you might want to gain confidence in the tightening cycle, halting reinvestments only once you were confident that the decision was unlikely to be reversed.  Some policymakers reinvestments beyond liftoff in order financial more accommodation if the economy weakens during the tightening cycle.  But other policymakers may be concerned that an end to reinvestments substantial period, implying that the much later liftoff, you might want to adopt a trigger or threshold relative to your interest rate target, economic conditions, or time.  Depending on the details of the approach taken, communications associated with an after-liftoff option could be more complicated than in the other options offers simplicity in tightening move less gradual than A third option would be to halt reinvestments at the same time as liftoff.  Taking actions on interest rates and the balance sheet simultaneously communications, but also could make the initial starting with either tool first.

to reinvesting panel, the monthly runoff of the case of Treasury to mature in size in 2016.  It is also subject to prepayment in the case of agency MBS (for which modeled estimates are shown in the portfolio, you could shift the allocation of assets within the portfolio-for example, by securities to expedite a return to an allto provide ongoing support to the housing market. Of course, ceasing reinvestments entirely is not the only alternative all payments of principal.  As seen in the bottom securities from the SOMA portfolio is quite variable in securities, which start uncertainty chart).  If you wished to see a steady decline in the size of the smooth the path by conducting partial reinvestments in months when runoff was particularly large, perhaps augmenting this strategy with sales of short-dated securities in months when runoff was small.  Separately, you could use reinvestment policies to diverting MBS reinvestments into Treasury Treasury portfolio, or vice versa staff memos on normalization.  You may want to address these The final page of your handout provides a copy of the questions that were distributed with the

in your contributions during the go-round.  Thank you, Madam Chair, that questions completes our prepared remarks.  We'd be happy to take questions.

YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  Let's go to a question and answer period, and I urge two-handed interventions when topics come up where there are a number of from back-and-forth.  Governor Tarullo. CHAIR as last time, issues that would benefit reinvestment.  As I read the memo and listened wrong-that than a real economic effect.  I know there's the continued stock it essentially a signaling device? MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Debby, I think this question is probably primarily directed toward you because it's about to your presentation today, I came away with the impression-but correct me if I'm you collectively think that the most significant effect of a decision to end reinvestment would be a signaling effect rather -flow debate, but apart from that, is

We think the signaling effect that this should have on short-term rates uncertainty around what kind of supply  For example, least some We don't think that's necessarily a big issue now, as we've been tapering purchases market participants that there could be a flow effect with the signal we send about our purchase plans. MS. LEONARD. probably wouldn't depend on which tool you use, but there is signaling effect an announcement on reinvestments could have in regards for MBS, there's some endogenous response to our purchases, and that creates at uncertainty. in a very predictable way, but we hear from that is associated impression, just listening to market that regardless of on which part of the yield curve the ceasing of reinvestment cessation of reinvestments would be read more a prelude to tightening or, if it came after liftoff, it would be read as sort of a MR. TARULLO.  I guess I had been under the participants, would have the most noticeable effects, that the generally as ramping up of tightening.  And I guess I'm asking whether the Desk shares that general view.

June 17-18, 2014

it seems that we can say things that should that big of news to markets, and they take it as a viewpoint of the reaction function.  I do Debby was trying to put in play there is if you're looking at early next year, then the will be on when the first increase in the policy rate happens.  So that's what the is potentially more signaling there. also true that if you stop the reinvestments at that point, which that point. MR. POTTER.  Based on last year's events, not be think what main focus memo looked at.  There Ex post , it is kept reinvesting, it would be a sign of all clear to might be either good for you or bad for you at to the question I had reinvestment.  It seems as though there's a certain contingency associated That is, it seems to me it's a little hard to judge now when that signal would either be most prefer.  So I was a bit concerned about the prospect at a particular stage in the normalization process.  Can you address a bit is outweighed by the need for clarity to markets, or do you think it's a MR. TARULLO.  Right.  That's very helpful, and that actually gets about the decision on with this. minimized or maximized, as we would of setting forth a chronology similar to what we did in June 2011, which had cessation of reinvestment clearly whether that concern legitimate concern and thus an argument for not committing ourselves now to where it would fit within the sequence of normalization policies?

Last year, when we tried to give clarity, it didn't work too well. It was like a blinding light.  [Laughter] a little bit different.  You saw how diffuse expectations are for would take seriously, surprisingly after all this time, the just a little bit in the MBS market.  And one of the issues the memo tried to address to reinvest or MR. POTTER. MR. TARULLO.  It was a lot of clarity. MR. POTTER.  This is when reinvestments end.  I think we flow effects is that we own a lot of mortgage-backed securities.  So our decision about whether

June 17-18, 2014

large signal for that market , which is, I think, the second point that Debby trying to make. not could be quite a was of the mortgage-backed securities.  And if we of securities that we are actually buying, then it is about 40 percent-so a think over the next two months, the reinvestments will be This is a result of the asset purchases that we've done.  We own-what was the share of the outstanding stock?-something like one-third limit it to the set significant presence in that market.  I larger than the new purchases that we're making.

to in the future, too, there's some uncertainty as to exactly how sheet and what risk we're putting back into the market over MS. LEONARD.  I could add to that, Simon.  With MBS, given the uncertainty as what prepayments will look like much will be rolling off our balance time.

CHAIR YELLEN.  A two-hander-President Bullard.

just add something?  Governor Tarullo, I think a key how you describe when it will be that you will want to end the timing is expected to be and instead condition that on economic outcomes that would suggest it was then appropriate to begin not there would be some intermediate too crisp and too clear, as we learned last think you're on a forced march to do it, and that, maybe, is where you get MR. ENGLISH.  Sorry, could I question that you face is reinvestment.  And as I think you were suggesting a moment ago, it probably would be better to not be too crisp and clear about what some set of reinvesting or reducing the amount of reinvestment.  Perhaps step, as Debby described.  But I think being a little bit year, can make people an adverse reaction.

June 17-18, 2014

the when, do you mean just in absolute terms or do you mean even relative to other MR. TARULLO.  Are you saying-when you're cautioning against being too crisp or clear about normalization steps?

Well, I think relative is okay.  I mean in absolute terms. MR. ENGLISH.

MR. TARULLO.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Plosser.

effects, Simon, I was looking at exhibit 3, at the those prior to when we started reducing purchases in MBS reducing purchases.  So should I interpret that as maybe the flow effect isn't big an effect on the spreads or what should I take away from that picture?  Because less now than we were. MR. PLOSSER.  Just about the flow option-adjusted spreads.  If I look at this past December and today, they have gone up and down, but they are kind of where they were before we started having that we are buying a lot true. MR. POTTER.  That is

MR. PLOSSER.  And the spreads are about the same now.

MR. POTTER.  There's a lot of forces that move around the option-adjusted spread.

MR. PLOSSER.  There's a lot of forces that move around lots of interest rates.

That's true, and that's one of the issues that we face with the large-scale know when we announced the $40 billion per month, that which is probably related to the dynamics of the tripwire for Vice Chairman Dudley's speech tells you something similar Now, I can construct calculations in which the market's view of the stock of MR. POTTER. asset purchase program.  It is probably only contributing 20 to 30 percent of the fluctuations we see.  So we look at experiments.  We had an effect which was a little outsized at first, mortgage market.  The to that as well.

June 17-18, 2014

following that speech to justify that fall in the model. mortgage-backed securities changed sufficiently option-adjusted spread.  But I wouldn't put 100 percent weight on that type of that you are facing as you move toward liftoff, the situation you don't want to conditions.  And we are putting a little bit of weight on panel 17, the market has moved a little bit, but a little bit all over the place.  Some people will be surprised right now. The issue have is an abrupt tightening of financial the MBS flow effect as potentially producing that, if you announced a reinvestment policy that was surprising to the market.  As you can see in it's

Just one point to make.  The effect of Vice Chairman Dudley's speech in the future, and that affects the stock of the securities long time, potentially.  And I think that also had an effect. telling me that there's a flow effect and how saying it's telling me there are stock effects and other market dynamics, and were before. MR. ENGLISH. in markets isn't really a flow effect.  We didn't change our flow of anything.  We were talking about a change in flow being further we're going to be holding for quite a So I'm not sure how much I want to read this as much I want to be we are now expected to hold more MBS for longer than we what I was trying to get at.  It's more than just sort ofof how to interpret that. MR. PLOSSER.  That's MR. ENGLISH.  It's hard to be confident

YELLEN.  President Bullard, you had a two-hander. CHAIR

because it has been on a schedule, has not had very much impact in markets. managed reinvestment policy in which you allowed the sheet to shrink at some fixed rate over time would be equally smooth and equally MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  This is a question for Debby.  You argued that our tapering, So, by analogy, could I argue that a balance predictable in markets, and that, there again, you would get very small effect or no effect?

June 17-18, 2014

doesn't necessarily mean by that you risk having the opposite effect.  I think with the amounts that we're looking one thing to go from $40 billion a month to zero.  Depending on how large an effect, right? MS. LEONARD.  We think that could certainly help.  That not doing it at for reinvestments, it's much you have coming off in any month, that may or may not have as

Yes.  So what I'm saying is if you look at this picture at the bottom of 4, that's saying that it's highly variable if you just cease reinvestments altogether.  But if so that the balance sheet goes down in an orderly way, then evidently, MR. BULLARD. exhibit you manage that process or I guess, you would get the same kind of effect that we've gotten from our taper, which is that that gets fully incorporated into market expectations.  There are no surprises.

a schedule like this, is what I'm saying, and then you think I think something like the speech by Vice Chairman Dudley does create something of a surprise in markets, because they are not quite sure how that is going to be managed in the future.  But then, we could announce it would work out smoothly if we went in that direction.

right, to provide that kind of clarity, I think then the market can market. MS. LEONARD.  That's slowly adjust and find other marginal buyers as we slowly step out of the

MR. BULLARD.  Thank you.

YELLEN.  President Fisher, did you have a two-hander? CHAIR

I did.  Simon, going back to your 30 percent number, in your own mind, MR. FISHER. do you contemplate us conducting reinvestment in order to maintain that ratio?

what the reinvestment would do-it would maintain that ratio. MR. POTTER.  That's some kind of adjustment of the reinvestment rates. MR. FISHER.  Unless we agreed on

subject to the rate at which the outstanding stock is growing.  The has been quite small for a while, as you know.  We would expect, then, that in MR. POTTER.  That is net issuance

June 17-18, 2014

of the outstanding stock reasonably constant. 2015-2016, that would start to grow, both as you got more activity in the housing market and house prices went up, the limit becomes a smaller share.  But effectively, if you reinvest the principal paydowns, you are keeping your share

MR. FISHER.  Thank you.

YELLEN.  Vice Chairman Dudley, did you have a two-hander? CHAIR

Yes, a two-hander.  On this issue of the announcement and stocks is very difficult, because it is also a question of, how does this signal affect pretty large rates-you know, last summer is a good example of that.  Even though it sheet is actually likely to evolve.  So I think market positioning VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. effect, I think it really depends a lot on market position.  This issue of distinguishing between flows what portfolios people actually want to hold.  And so you can have a signal that has a effect on interest doesn't change how the balance is really a big factor here, and I think we do not want to lose sight of that.

think we do have to say something, because we basically said in the old exit principles And I think to say that probably not a very good outcome.  But I do agree with Governor we don't want to say more than what we actually know.  We certainly want to keep looks like, what the Now, in terms of Governor Tarullo's observation about what do we need to say, my own view is I that we're going to do the reinvestment ahead of raising short-term rates. we have no idea now, is Tarullo that flexibility, because when you would want to time the end of reinvestments could depend on a whole host of factors, depending on what the shape of the yield curve strength of the economy is, what is happening in the housing sector.  So you might want to maintain a fair amount of flexibility in terms of the precise timing.

YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota, did you have a two-hander? CHAIR

June 17-18, 2014

actually builds on Vice Chairman Dudley was just saying.  I understand the desire to retain flexibility, but I that the Committee's to retain flexibility in September 2012 left markets with uncertainty about what we meant reaction function, about how hawkish or dovish this cost of retaining flexibility-that your decisions are not viewed as of the Committee.  My own view of the events of 2013 is that we weren't what led to the challenges.  And I think we MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I did.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  And it what guess I took a slightly different lesson from the events of 2013, which is desire about sufficient improvement in the labor market outlook.  And then our decisions were viewed as containing information about our Committee is.  And so that's a being necessarily conditional on economic outcomes, but rather on the makeup and the inclinations sufficiently clear in September 2012, and that's should be careful in thinking that through as we are thinking about communicating in the future.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Governor Powell.

about MBS, which I'd like to ask about Treasuries.  There is quite a Treasury volumes coming up in 2016 as the MEP cycles out.  I assume these the Treasury market, in ordinary times, to be able that the case?  And, if not, have we thought about ways to MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I had several questions have now been fully answered.  But I have one bit of volatility in are the kind of volumes that we would expect to absorb without great difficulty.  Is mitigate that?

we're not rolling it over, this is an amount that we think the market be able to accommodate in their refundings. MS. LEONARD.  If would be able to absorb, and that Treasury would also be able to make plans for in their primary issuance and

MR. POWELL.  Thanks.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Fischer.

June 17-18, 2014

we want a system in which we about the predictability of the MR. FISCHER.  I want to slightly change the focus, and that's why it was one-handed.  I have a series of questions.  First, we are thinking about whether are going to use the overnight RRP and IOER, and then make a decision about what we want to do with the federal funds rate.  What information did you get federal funds rate from this experiment?

a little bit was an untested approach is that we don't know rate on the overnight RRP would lead to changes in flows in the federal market, which would allow us to then control the fed funds rate.  We think that the logic that we would be able to do that.  I don't know, Bill, if you want to add some more. MR. POTTER.  It's printed somewhere between 7 and 10 basis points.  It's firmer over the last week.  The reason we said it whether changing the funds suggests the funds rate has continued to move with other the overnight RRP rate has set a market rates that has been reasonably good in the period when there was a reduction in issuance and rates fell.  I think that what we have learned is really about control and the we can get from the overnight RRP rate.  But as Simon indicated, particularly if you 5 basis points or 7 basis to the higher floor?  And so how rapidly does the funds rate get And also, there is the constraint that if you want to keep the funds market more or less the overnight RRP rate too far, too close to the IOER the funds market. MR. ENGLISH.  I think that's right, that short-term market rates, as Simon discussed.  We think that floor for bill control that were trying to hit a point target, the question of, if the funds rate is points below your point target, how much do you move the overnight RRP rate to get it there? How quickly do markets adjust there? trading as it is trading now, you can't raise rate, because that will ultimately undermine the trading in

just a bunch of things that we don't really know, and trying to implement an is a target for the funds rate that you are trying to hit by moving the So there are approach in which there

June 17-18, 2014

reasonably large spread between target, and you just have some uncertainty of where the funds rate will be relative to target. overnight RRP rate would require some learning by doing.  And potentially some of that learning would be, do you want to also be constrained by keeping a IOER and overnight RRP.  There may be times when you can't hit your to live with question I have is, if we had never had the federal the federal funds rate for two or three years, and more or less works, and let's say there's a lot of turnover on this Committee, so federal funds rate.  [Laughter]  Isn't this a strange thing that Federal Home were reinventing it? MR. FISCHER.  Okay.  So the next funds rate, and we run without worrying about the system nobody remembers why we used the you want to focus and go back to?  It's a market between European banks and Loan Banks.  Why would you put that in the middle of this system if you

It's currently this somewhat idiosyncratic market.  But in normal the rate at their marginal cost of actually seems to me an attractive rate to target.  The marginal cost of funds for DIs, a relatively small market in which we control a lot of the parameters, so that we can operate small balance sheet, relatively small operations, market rates.  I think it has MR. ENGLISH. times-and we hope to get back to normal times-it will not be.  It will be, again, which DIs are lending to each other in an overnight market, and it will be funds, and it it's in that market and control rates with a relatively and depend on the DIs basically to arbitrage that into other short-term real appeal as a long-term way of implementing policy.  That's why we ended up, back in the 1980s, using that structure for implementing policy.

would agree Well, I think the discussion around this table has suggested are people who want to go back, down the road, to implementing policy with the funds If the Committee were confident they didn't want to go back to that, then I with you that currently this is a somewhat strange market.  Why are we twisting ourselves around to not unwind that market? that there

June 17-18, 2014

least costly to step away from that rate for a while, allow potentially get very small and idiosyncratic, and then try to come back to it later. rate.  And that, I think, suggests it is at that market to

Can I just add one thing?  We need some market rates that we would is actually working through from the other rates that we something like the effective federal MR. POTTER. actually look at to see whether the policy are setting.  And it is pretty natural for the FOMC to look at funds rate as the market rate that it might be looking at, just because that's what we used before.

comment.  As I understand it-this is academic a complicated story.  And if you were tell that story, it would sound no less complicated than the stories we have about using and all that, and everybody has to get up in the morning and figure out into the market, and so forth.  So is it a very natural policy MR. FISCHER.  Well, just one last knowledge-actually hitting the federal funds rate is starting to the federal funds rate exactly how much liquidity to put rate?

with that in normal times, because in normal times, market is small, we control a lot of the parameters through reserve Treasury balance is going to be.  So we can make pretty small adjustments very closely, and we understand that market very well. MR. ENGLISH.  I actually disagree as I said, the funds requirements and through our open market operations, and we have pretty good visibility into, for example, what the and target the funds rate implementation process that is feasible, but you would very, very large market.  And it would just be, I think, a very different that we would have to learn about, and we'd learn about them, and we'd I would be at least hesitant and would want to think pretty hard about shifting to a system in which we're implementing policy in an ongoing way through an RRP rate and our operations are overnight RRPs.  I think that's an have to do it with a much bigger balance sheet, because potentially you'd be doing a lot of RRPs to push around what is a set of special factors

June 17-18, 2014

is a very different way of implementing policy, and for the balance sheet and the size of our operations.  I know have more to say on that. figure them out, and we could do that.  But it it would have serious consequences Simon will think we have to worry about checks getting stuck on planes MR. POTTER.  I don't anymore, the way that check processing works.  So that's good.  That simplifies one part of some of the issues that we have.

we have to worry about the computers being hacked. MR. FISCHER.  Now right.  It's a lot easier than it would have been 25 years ago.  I do to people what that operating system was, it is not the most obvious MR. POTTER.  That's think that when you describe operating system that we evolved to.  However, it worked really well, and it achieved the goals of the FOMC for a substantial period of time.

in the financial system, which I think we discussed each day, we could hit the target basically by injecting a very small amount of now, and whether we'd financial conditions. Regulatory reform and other changes at the last meeting, make me, I think, a little less confident that we could go back to that nice position in which, cash, you know, one three-thousandths of what the balance sheet is right really want to do that to affect

Dudley was really clear at the last meeting that none of you really Desk.  What you care about is the impact you are conditions.  And Bill English gave, I think, the real strength rate, which is that targeting it was very effective in moving financial balance sheet, whether that market will be as effective as some other system, particularly driven by regulation. I think Vice Chairman care about which rate we target each day on the going to have on general financial for the federal funds conditions around.  What we don't know, when we get back to 2021, 2022, whenever it happens, and we've got a smaller markets, given the change in the financial

June 17-18, 2014

MR. FISCHER.  Okay.  Thank you.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman Dudley.

DUDLEY.  There is no reason, though, why we have to make this out one or the other?  As long as both are still it seems that it's more sensible to learn more.  I mean, the world is going to be quite in 2021, 2022.  I don't see why a decision needs to be made today.  I mean, Bill, do you or in any way pre-commit ourselves? VICE CHAIRMAN decision today about what we're going back to.  It seems to me that the only decision we would probably want to make is, do we not want to rule viable, different think we have to decide all of you have said in the past is that doors.  And I think it would be at least pretty close to closing a door, for the rate on overnight RRP very close to IOER; it should the federal funds market to function, at least in its traditional way.  And if all of in terms of IOER and overnight RRP, then I think it would MR. ENGLISH.  No, not at all.  But I think what you don't want to close example, if the Committee went with then not expect the communication about policy was be difficult to go back to something like the pre-crisis structure.

rate of interest on excess reserves, one possibility is that we would get back the traditional market.  What we have right now is a market that we don't want someone to write a rate is constructed, because it is basically with the Fed, giving it to a foreign banking back into a bank account with the Fed and earns 25 basis points.  That's efficient deposit market.  We had a very efficient market MR. POTTER.  So, Bill, not to disagree [laughter], but if we got the overnight RRP close to the fed funds long newspaper story on about how the effective FHLBs taking money out of their bank accounts organization that puts it a pretty unusual market.  It's a very before for sharing liquidity across banks.  Both of them seem to work in terms of getting your intent through to financial market conditions.

YELLEN.  President Lacker had a two-hander. CHAIR

MR. LACKER.  Madam Chair?

Fischer twotheir reserves target.  It worked by itself.  We only really target the last day.  It was the expectation of that that made the funds rate equal the two-week maintenance period.  A lot has changed, but the implementing a point target for the funds rate-provides the funds rate. MR. LACKER.  Two observations on the line of questioning that Governor initiated.  One is that under the old regime, when targeting the fed funds rate, there was this week window in which DIs had to hit needed to hit the the target for all the other days in fact that we were targeting the federal funds rate is what led it to behave the way it did.  It is not obvious that now-when we're not good evidence about how the relationship between the RP rate and the funds rate would work if we were targeting that, in the old regime, the spread between the RP rate and the funds tremendously variable.  You know, it was above 15 basis points, below 15 basis points, market interest rates.  So the nature of these spreads is a point would be like is difficult to do. I'd also point out rate was above and below very frequently.  And it didn't seem to bother us, and as you said, we had effective control over the broad set of something that is very regime-dependent.  And just making an inference about what target for the funds rate

market participants are building Fed RRP facility.  And I raised this point last fall.  We and we are raising adjustment costs.  We are inducing people to to reverse, and the prospect of those costs has the to back away from offering RRPs on the About whether we need to decide our long-run framework or not, we're building some machinery and we're raising some expectations.  And some business models on the availability of a are raising expectations, undertake investments that would be costly ability to kind of stay our hand, and make us reluctant

them now.  This is why I raised the question at the scale and scope that we are offering beginning.

Can I just make one little point?  The fact that we had a lot of control target.  In the situation we're in right now, people might doubt the precision market.  So announcing a point target, we'd proof of concept that we can get the effective federal funds rate to hit target with a reasonable amount of ease. MR. POTTER. means that, if people know you have a lot of control, you don't necessarily have to do that much to achieve the point of control that we have on the federal funds probably have to have a that effective.  But if thing that has a fixed relationship to IOER, and announce that that's the thing the same way, even though if to claim you're targeting, as MR. LACKER.  I'd say a third thing-so it could be that IOER is quite we choose another we are changing, it's not clear everything is going to work out just you looked at it, the funds rate would look like a peculiar market Governor Fischer pointed out.

thought in response to what you said on building overnight we don't necessarily intend to use it in the long run. MR. ENGLISH.  Can I just add a expectations about overnight RRP?  I think the Committee can choose to build expectations or not.  In particular, one could imagine in September saying that we are going to use RRP as a tool during normalization, but you go to a point target.  Over time, the balance sheet is shrinking.  Over time, the important in applying a floor.  The setting of IOER is pull rates higher.  So you allow the overnight RRP rate to fall relative to market relative to IOER, and over time it becomes essentially irrelevant.  Nobody really wants it And I can see a path forward that would involve, let's say, raising IOER and overnight RRP basically in parallel as you tighten, raising the target range for the federal funds rate, maybe later on overnight RRP isn't as helpful and isn't as sufficient to rates,

June 17-18, 2014

it is lousy relative to market rates, and so it goes away.  I don't see that there you raise rates when the time comes to raise rates, but not make it part of a because the rate on isn't a process for proceeding whereby you could use overnight RRP as a tool to give confidence that you can long-run toolkit.

in the long run, you might have some about possibly relying quite heavily on nonbanks, paying them interest.  That gets overnight RRP facility in the short term but not necessarily forever. MS. WEINBACH.  I was just going to add one thing along those lines, that in the April memos the staff raised the issue of the consideration of how big of a footprint you would like to have in the long run in the nonbank sector.  And the conversation so far has mainly been about control and efficacy and transitioning back and forth.  But concerns attention politically, maybe, and you may just have some longer-run considerations that mean that you could rely on the

Chair, may I follow up?  There was this point where, in the that the overnight RRP rate isn't that before we would reduce MR. LACKER.  Madam sequence you sketched out, in which we discover necessary.  Then, we reduce it.  I'm unclear on how we would learn that it.

Within the range between overnight RRP and IOER, market rates reserves goes down, as IOER is the more toolMR. ENGLISH. would move up toward IOER.  As the amount of effective

I mean, we know that it's about a 15 or 20 basis point spread you need IOER and the ON RRP rate.  We have a lot of information that points to something interest rate on ON RRPs at 15 or 20 basis points, you are not whether, without that floor, the arbitrage is effective. MR. LACKER. to arbitrage in that range.  So if you keep the going to see

rates in the way I described, doing you all that much good.  It might be that RRP would provide a sufficient magnet, would move rates I described.  You would ultimately shrank and the amount of reserves shrank, market rates moving up between overnight RRP and IOER.  And, as it take-up on the overnight RRP facility.  It would just be less lot of dollars coming into overnight MR. ENGLISH.  I agree, at the beginning, when you raise you wouldn't see whether the overnight RRP was just raising IOER with no overnight up along with IOER.  You would not see that in the process see, as the balance sheet within that range-that, say, 20 basis point range moved higher, you would have less important as a way of providing a floor.  You wouldn't get a

YELLEN.  President Fisher has a two-hander. CHAIR

Well, with regard to Governor Fischer's comment about the possible last meeting about the contractual minds give us an in terms of, if we were to move away from fed funds qua fed funds, does this a problem from the standpoint of the outstanding $11 trillion in contractual obligations the last meeting? MR. FISHER. vestigial nature of fed funds, we had a discussion at the obligations being $11 trillion.  Just for point of clarification, did our legal answer on that present that we discussed at are a number of issues which are addressed in the previous this time.  The first one is, how robust is the current effective rate print?  And do we feel that we can print the effective federal funds rate in the data or the FR-2420? MR. POTTER.  I think there memo and the memo that you got federal funds future, either from the brokered

June 17-18, 2014

as a reference rate could get low if the volume in the markets got of incentives for behavior that we don't want. Now, the quality of that low.  And we don't want a very small cash market supporting $11 trillion of other types of instruments, because that offers lots issue if we try to expand the federal funds rate.  If we take option 2, in effective federal funds rate which has the Eurodollar contract frustration claims.  We don't think that's a a higher risk than under option 1, in which you are printing off the federal bank funding rate, whatever name we go with.  That was one There is another which basically we start printing an transactions there, whether that could lead to high chance, but that's funds classic, say, and an overnight of the issues we addressed in that memo.

think any of the lawyers in the room will be able to give us great confidence on don't know, Scott, if you want to explain that. I don't this.  Scott had some reasonably good ideas about how, when we refine the data collection on the FR-2420, we could guide market participants.  I

one in which we continue to print the first effective federal market to self-adjust without changing the effective fed funds rate. MR. ALVAREZ.  Yes.  We think that we could do either of the two options.  The advantage of the second option is we think it would have slightly less disruptive effect in the market, the second option being the funds rate and create a new rate.  That allows the expectations around the first in some contracts are going to want to terms based on the information that is available.  Our rate is put out there not as the markets to use, but just as information that we make available to the they are able to use as they want.  As long as we give them notice about how we the market more flexibility contracts.  And so we think the second one gives it a little more flexibility. On the other hand, either way the parties renegotiate their one that we expect public and that are changing those rates and we give them various options, we give to adjust its

June 17-18, 2014

1 in the way we described this, Scott, is that right? it is, soMR. POTTER.  I think that's option Yes, I think

MR. ALVAREZ.  Okay.

One of the problems with option 1, or, as Scott called it, option 2, is we might be harder to do.  And we can't really say that it's a printing, but we'd like to persuade people to move to the more robust MR. POTTER. are still printing the effective federal funds rate.  So shifting people from those contracts which have the effective federal funds rate very bad rate that we're rate.

reference-rate work that Governor Powell is going to be involved in is trying reference rates are more robust in the future.  And the effective rate that we are printing doesn't have some of the characteristics you'd like of a robust rate. A lot of the to make sure that currently two-hander.  I'm sorry.  President Fisher, do CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Powell with a you want to-

FISHER.  I'm just trying to decide, does this interfere with our deciding between It sounds like option 1 is a little more friendly. MR. option 1 and 2?

it is.  Under option 1, the push to move from the federal funds We could indicate through the data collection that we believe that this and try to make it clear from that. MR. POTTER.  I think classic is less big. overnight bank funding rate is a more robust rate

MR. FISHER.  Thank you very much.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Powell, a two-hander, and then we're going to go back to our- my comments, but because of the I have been involved in, I've spent a fair amount of time on this contract MR. POWELL.  I was going to talk about this in LIBOR work that

June 17-18, 2014

'no.'  I mean, there are other things that can be weighed back and forth, but under just frustration issue, and my answer to the question of do we need to let the contract frustration issue drive this is New York law, it's a very, very difficult case to make, and we've got pretty good facts that wouldn't fit within any of the precedents that have been done, in my view.  I no longer have a license to practice law, but that's my take.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Rosengren. CHAIR

topic completely if I could, and I want to caps.  My question is, the purpose of the caps is to deal with intended to deal with micro issues money market funds.  So if we think about the prime money market funds-and are in European bank debt.  Currently most of that paying about 25 basis points.  So it's a way for the prime funds, in effect, to pay for MR. ROSENGREN.  I'm going to switch the talk about the individual rigid broad-based financial-stability concerns.  It's not really specific to Simon mentioned that one-third of their assets bank debt is their management fees, but it doesn't really get passed on to the investor.

that the prime funds previously were investing in are no longer going to are going to switch, or the prime funds are going to situation in which the caps become time when it was just meant to be a 25-basis-point change that we did that wasn't bunch of these individual rigid caps becoming binding.  And now we concern, and it could be at the we tighten. But if all of a sudden we raise rates when Europe isn't-say we go up by 25 basis points-then the assets be particularly attractive.  So either investors switch.  That's going to cause variation in individual funds, both in government funds, potentially, and in the prime funds.  And you might get a binding at a done in conjunction with Europe.  And as a result, the micro decisions that the prime funds have been making result in a have something that's binding not because of a financial-stability very first time

June 17-18, 2014

caps?  And do you think the individual micro-focused run the risk of not really dealing with broader financial-stability much more micro concerns than we're trying to get at? So do you have that concern with the individual caps that are so concerns, but maybe in those terms, but following up on that at the variability of take-up of an individual fund.  So if you think of the between where you set the size of the cap and the frequency of cap has a better tradeoff.  Because the individual caps are individual cap to get an equal frequency of binding an individual cap versus an aggregate cap.  So the individual cap has a less favorable tradeoff the aggregate cap, whereby you can essentially have a lower aggregate cap and at the same one of the arguments I made during the get a better tradeoff between the potential surge and the frequency caps to bind.  That was one of the arguments in favor of the applied to that specific European case, but that was the underlying MR. NATALUCCI.  I don't think we thought thought, we looked tradeoff during a potential surge binding of these caps, the aggregate much more volatile, you need a much higher for than time have the same frequency of binding.  That's briefing, that you essentially of the time that you want the aggregate cap.  It wasn't argument.

of the liftoff the case, then, that we'd want to trigger one of the any rates behind.  So I take the point that we should think very carefully, if we do use initially raising rates. MR. POTTER.  One issue is, suppose we do use the overnight RRP as part and we do have caps, we should think very carefully about what might happen as we're first raising money market rates.  It wouldn't be caps, because what we're trying to do is raise rates and use the overnight RRP to make sure we don't leave the overnight RRP, about how flows might change as we are

So even if we raised dollar rates, those would vanish from think you would see

I think everyone will be relieved think there are back to interest rates are back in the 3 to 4 percent range, consistent with what the a lot of these issues that seem very important right spreads, are basically very important fact that we're going to be raising rates from 25 to 50 basis points.  I see those questions as probably being MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam to know that I'm going back to the line of conversation between Bill English and President Lacker.  [Laughter]  Seriously, I thought it was very important and very interesting.  I are two kinds of long runs to think about.  One kind of long run is when interest rates normal.  So Committee thinks is back to normal.  I think now, about 20 basis point spreads versus 40 basis point right now because of the think when we're back to the 3 to 4 percent range, I don't as material.

If we think about allowing the spread to increase Is there a technical problem with So my question is, how easy would it be to vary the usage of the facility, the overnight reverse repo facility, as we raise rates? between the two rates as we were to raise rates, is that doable? that?

think so.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Evans. CHAIR

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Right.  Thank you.

EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Let me pick up where President Kocherlakota first question-I have two-but he just asked one, which was would the ON this is only going to be a not really, MR. left off, because my RRP effectiveness be reduced if we announced explicitly that temporary program and we have no intention of it being permanent.  So the answer is not much difference.

interest-rate control. MR. POTTER.  Not on the permanent think we would benefit than later, had some of the scenario analysis.  But if we are thinking about MR. EVANS.  Okay.  All right.  So the second one is, I personally think it's going to be tough to end this overnight RRP program.  I keep thinking about what the consequences of it are.  I'd like to ask a question along those lines.  And I if we, sooner rather

long-run implications of using the overnight RRP program with our RRP rate behave during a global risk event? how to understand the monetary policy tools, how would the overnight

There's a lot of risk aversion somewhere else in the time when the United States is running the more normal funds rate, say 4 percent, and economy is doing well and maybe we're worried about inflation.  Following up on that is a big policy indicator, and we're running an aggregate cap to quality.  We hit the cap.  The overnight rate is going to run down at a time when Suppose there's a global risk event. world at a in fact, the Governor Fischer's question, which I interpreted as maybe we don't need the funds rate, so maybe it's the overnight rate with flight we're posturing that we probably need tighter policy.  How are we thinking about doing monetary policy in a world configuration like that, in which signals are being confused?

cap is triggered.  The uniform price comes in, and then the rate that clears that auction goes down.  And the next week in the that temporary effect there.  If you had a more rigid cap, you would still have flight-toUnited States, into other markets, that would be affecting those rates. MR. POTTER.  So in this world, the aggregate auction example, the take-up can go up in the overnight RRP and the cap resets to a large amount.  So you have quality flows into the that we really didn't want to MR. EVANS.  Suppose the Committee had an attitude increase beyond this cap very much; that, you know, we're willing to use this, but we don't-

really want to get into U.S. they will tier through various U.S. assets at that point, which effectively will ease conditions in the United States, which you might not like.  With the overnight RRP, rate. MR. POTTER.  So then what you're going to see is if people assets, financial you have a little bit more control of that because you're fixing that past we would-you know, when we had a funds rate that we mean, we could control it, and Treasury rates would start plummeting, like the MR.

not.  But all of a sudden this could lead to when you think that inflation is the United are we going to implement a tighter policy?

The caps are not meant to entirely solve your problem right there.  They're breaker would work, to reassess conditions and the appropriate response will be. MR. NATALUCCI.  One point we try to make clear in the memo is that this is meant to be a circuit breaker, to give you some time to reassess what conditions in markets are and what the appropriate the overnight RRP or you could decide to play with the caps.  You could decide you decide just supposed to give you some time, as a circuit decide what

lately we haven't seen too many instances in which the U.S. financial system we see is spikes of risk aversion abroad, we see spikes of increase in corporate credit spreads and declines in stock prices, wherein-although reduction in the fed funds rate might not be MR.

we still thought that there could be in the United States. MR. EVANS.  Right-it was one in which inflationary pressures they raise the overnight RRP ratea flight to quality.  So they're busting through the cap. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So MR. EVANS.  No, but there's MR. POTTER.  But then the next week people know that the cap is going to go up.  So

If I can clarify something at least-it's either the cap or the rate, right? want quantity because you have concerns about the quantity.  Then you're going to have to MR. ENGLISH. You either set a quantity or a price, and I think President Evans is suggesting that you don't to raise the

Alternatively, if you want to raise the and you want to do whatever you think is right for monetary policy, you're going to have to, the cap be let the rate at least over some period of time-maybe not immediately, as Fabio was saying-let much higher.

Also, it's the aggregate that matters here.  So it depends what kind mechanism you have set up.  If you adjust based on usage during the previous week and you cap moves itself up to accommodate demand, and the price impact is lessened. MR. NATALUCCI. of reset quickly, then the going to be intended to be an example in so that we could expand it into, potentially, a very large cap a tremendous flight to quality.  We'd have to be making some contingency decisions to allow that cap to increase.  There are a lot of moving parts in it when we have a funds rate as the it is issues in a careful, clear fashion sooner rather than MR. EVANS.  Okay.  One thing, I mentioned is that this is a more mature period.  So we have to decide what the size of our balance sheet is so that we have sufficient assets on our balance sheet if there was about how we'd want to be able this, and we're familiar with the way we've thought about instrument and the Treasury market responds as it does to market forces.  And I think incumbent upon us to just think through these later.  That's really my only point.

think we have been trying to think through them in a If the balance sheet gets smaller, then we'd have to think about whether you want to are many reasons separate from interest rate control that this is Reserve might want to offer, reasons to do with the regulatory changes provision of safe assets.  I think we're focusing a lot on the the negative parts to do with the disruptive surges.  There are other MR. POTTER.  President Evans, I clear way. keep the overnight RRP.

I think the Committee will be making state-contingent decisions in a MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I thought this was a very interesting and useful conversation. The part I took away as being especially for these caps we should be communicating about them if they are put wired, I think, is very short period of time to deal with a crisis.

I think it's not humanly possible to think through all of the scenarios that will arise in those situations.  I think staff has done an excellent job of think it's very challenging for us to be kind of calm we're sitting in right now with VIX at whatever it is, thinking about what's going to happen in these crisis scenarios. I would actually push back a little bit on what President Evans said about the need to think through these scenarios. possible leading us through a wide range of important ones, but I thinking through this in the 11Â½-to be make in the memo is that, if you want to ease about how it would work when the cap binds, how the auction it bind occasionally.

Having read note the openness with which participants in which the Chair encouraged productive with which the staff has responded in the second set of memos.  And I say all heap praise key issues that will serve us well over the course my basic reaction is a growing uneasiness at the prospect of ON RRP among the tools we use during normalization, and with respect certainly merit in thinking about the idea of having ON RRP as a monetary policy.  So my uneasiness is grounded not in opposition to the Turning now to the substance of the set of policy issues on normalization, I don't want to bury my lead, so I'll say upfront that our normalization process resulting in a large, regularized ON RRP program.  I hasten to add that I think we need to have to longer-term policies, there's permanent tool of instrument as such, but in a concern that by committing or perhaps overcommitting ourselves now to a large, sustained ON RRP facility, we could be courting unintended and possibly undesirable consequences.

One large and permanent ON RRP facility would encourage a assume greater risk in the belief that they can quickly shift their asset certified might take advantage of this safest of havens through a restructuring of such actors would have what we might call a line of liability with qualified counterparties.

Even financial actors that are not ON RRP counterparties the interconnections of financial actors, whereby standing memos for this meeting didn't really address the potential for far-reaching financial sector.

The counterparties was desirable precisely because of the intention to use ON RRP as a primary tool of normalization.  In any case, I don't think we yet have a very good basis for understanding the effects a large, sustained ON RRP program would have.  Among other things, I wonder whether such a program some years from now its contemplated termination would be seen as too disruptive financial sector.

financial-stability concerns from the previous meeting were addressed mainly on a system of caps in order to limit the potential for a surge that it's very difficult to determine avoid disruptive surges. The through a proposal for some variant of disintermediation during a crisis.  The memo on financial-stability concerns considers both individual and aggregate caps but forthrightly acknowledges what level of cap would best balance the presumed reliance on ON RRP to firm rates and the desire to the cap might be set at average recent use week of the tantamount to forgoing this balancing effect by having formal caps that are not at least would be uncomfortable launching a normalization program that interests of maximum control over Actually, though, I read the suggestion that plus as much as $300 billion-the estimated amount of flight to quality in the worst crisis-as practically binding.

I think there's some reason for skepticism that the caps would hold in a period of near-crisis, and in fact, I circuit breakers or triggers rather than real caps dynamic that would ensue.  Based on what we know and have discussed to this point, the cap system strikes me as an almost textbook case of a time-consistency problem.  We will grow the

And, it's circumstances, but it's precisely for this reason that the caps may lack ex ante credibility.

the Fed would mean the withdrawal of funding from lots affect significantly credit is flowing in the economy.  But in this new world, we might have resort to an intermediator of something less than last resort. how much more disintermediation would take place in a world in which a safe asset whose price was, at least for a time, insensitive to increased the amount we saw actually occur during the last financial crisis.  But least possible that it would be significantly greater and, indeed, that the existence of a program would, by facilitating disintermediation, amplify it during such as that we experienced in the late summer of 2011.  More is possible that such a program would encourage business models of short-term A large-scale flight to quality at of private balance sheets, a circumstance in which we would doubtless feel considerable pressure, policy and political, to lend the funds that we were borrowing.  In that case, we would once again be in the business of creating our alphabet facilities that de facto where relatively scarce morphed from being a lender of last I think it's hard to know the Fed was providing demand over and above it's at large, standing ON RRP moderate stress periods, generally, it intermediation that would be premised on the ability to exit quickly to a completely safe haven.

If the program does not become and remain predictably large, the odds of unintended and perhaps prominent use of the program in pursuit of specific monetary policy ends, as opposed to simply for testing, might provide some insight into what the effects would be.

I why we'd necessarily want to rule out the possibility of continuing its monetary policy instrument.  It's from the early growth that concern me.

implications for our choices on normalization to be at least somewhat constructive here, I've tried to specify for Obviously, this set of concerns has policies, and in an effort myself what I think those implications are.  First, we should rely principally on the IOER rate to affect interest rates.

fine-tuning using ON RRP, to the we set the federal funds rate as a target-whether the current or revised version of the target should be a range rather than a specific point.  I'm not really sure better to have this rate as a target or whether the Committee can instead simply be and other instruments on relevant interest rates without setting today. Second, in order to avoid the need for continuous degree that federal funds rate-that whether it's monitoring the effect of IOER even a target range, and on that point I'm interested to hear the views of others to limit the growth of the ON RRP program, the spread should be at least the Third, so as current 20 basis points.

VICE CHAIRMAN used the word 'large' a lot in your been able to get a very good system that people had contemplated.  But I have to say that MR. TARULLO.

Thank you, Madam Chair.  Let me begin by thanking the staff for the background memos on normalization issues.  I thought these a wide range of topics that could intend to simply walk through the four questions posed in the appendix of the staff 'Overview monetary policy.  My main that I think it is risky to keep referring to the federal funds rate or its more The first question concerns the wisdom of keeping the federal funds rate as a primary vehicle for Committee communications regarding the stance of comment here is

This leaves the overnight reverse repo rate, most promising candidate for the label of policy Moreover, the inappropriately in times of stress, as events outside U.S. borders.  This could make for a difficult situation to manage if FOMC communications were to be squarely centered on such a rate.  The IOER rate, in my view, also has limitations because financial intermediation with its broader system of counterparties, as the rate.

suggesting how the overnight RRP rate might in conjunction with the IOER rate seemed reasonable to me.  I would be open to making makes it clear that this The scenarios outlined in the staff analysis be set some reference to the federal funds rate, but obliquely and in a way that particular short-term rate does not today carry the importance that it once did.

the potential circuit breakers to prevent what might repo program during periods of memo on this topic, I would be willing to support, at least is that, should a period of severe financial stress in which financial firms are turning to the overnight reverse repo program aggressively, we breached to respond to the crisis-and in this the comments just made by Governor Tarullo that these are not credible The second question posed concerns be thought of as excessive take-up in the overnight reverse financial stress.  After reviewing the initially, an aggregate cap that would adjust dynamically according to relatively slowly changing macroeconomic conditions.

We want the cap to be binding during do not want it to be binding during normal periods, including year, and tax deadlines, when flows in and out of funds much larger than normal, particularly if this becomes an attractive Thus, I am quite concerned that understood at this time.

Obviously, these questions have implications for monetary control, communications, and financial handout, especially, as President Rosengren mentioned himself, the need few years and to recognize that we will be set up a plan that both To begin, I just want to reiterate my support for the areas of common ground that are listed in exhibit 1 of the both for flexibility in our approach over the next doing a lot of learning along this path.  I think we want to make sure we allows for that flexibility and recognizes the need to learn along the way.

my answers to the four questions, my preference is that we initially target a interest rate on excess reserves and the be sufficient to achieve a reasonable target range-say, 25 basis points. To preview range for the federal funds rate.  I believe that varying the reverse repo rate should

And I support am not as a substitute.

and financial stability shortmarket rate like the fed funds rate has an advantage, and that there can be times when there are idiosyncratic factors that drive the repo rate down or up, spread from that repo rate to the market rate to be moved around.  Going back to a William Poole's 1970 article in, targeting a market rate like the federal funds rate and the repo rate and why a market rate is better than the So let me expand on each of these points.  First, monetary control both call for continuing to emphasize the fed funds rate during normalization.  Most of the time, an administered overnight repo rate would provide similar monetary control of relevant term rates, but I do think targeting a is that causing the principle from insulates you from idiosyncratic factors that create spreads between that acts as an automatic stabilizer.  So that's my argument for overnight repo rate.

of communications, our lengthy briefings and discussions on this issue make it think we've got to to understand our is well known. In terms clear that normalization is already complicated enough.  So, where possible, I keep our procedures simple and familiar and make it easier for the public policies.  And as I said back in April, the fed funds rate may not be perfect, but it to the question of a point target versus a targeted range-I strongly support a range as this process of normalization.  A quarter-point range will provide sufficient while reducing pressure to immediately perfect our use of the IOER rate So we start macroeconomic control, and the reverse repo facility.

June 17-18, 2014

we will learn how to best control the fed funds rate with these We will also learn about how much take-up there will be on the overnight reverse target at some point in the future.  But to my mind, the most important thing to control market interest rates per the requirements or per I really see the need to to raise for macroeconomic through the facilities we have. Now, over time instruments. repo facility.  And as we get that information, and we get a finer understanding of this, we can transition to a point we need to do in this early stage of normalization is to make sure that we can demonstrate to the public our confidence in our ability the desires or as needed for monetary policy goals.  In the early stages, focus attention on the fact that we have an interest rate we are trying reasons, and we are able to do it overnight to gaming and actually create some incentives for firms to use the facility the Committee adjust the cap as needed, as we learn more about the market take-up and an aggregate fixed we could adjust that. Turning to the second question, when it comes to circuit breakers on the reverse repo facility, some sort of static cap would be simple and preferred.  Dynamic caps are potentially subject more.  In addition, they are hard to properly calibrate, as said in some of the earlier conversations we had today, and I also think they are just more difficult to communicate.  I recommend that we let behavior.  Again, thinking of this as the early decision, it would be to have static cap, but then as we learn more over the next six months or a year after we start this process,

ending reinvestment sometime after liftoff.  My views on this are similar to or later negligible economic or financial effects.  This is just not a first-order policy decision of achievement of goals.  However, Third, I favor how Governor Tarullo set up that question.  Stopping reinvestment six months earlier should have in terms of the effects on the economic outlook and in terms ending reinvestment before liftoff, or even at the time of liftoff, could be counterproductive

In a way, I think of the reinvestment decision off the front page of the paper and buried in the business section, because that really is the level of effect it has on the economy.  So I regarding the timing of the ending of reinvestment-there or economic conditions.  I do think we want to a number of people have already mentioned, to be able to and financial conditions. I would rather avoid the the table until we have this as wanting to get back of the would not be more specific than that were some ideas of linking it to the interest rate have that flexibility, for the reasons make that decision based on economic conditions simple, and I would argue against I guess we all take different lessons went very smoothly.  I don't think And when we do end reinvestment, we should keep it trying to smooth the week-to-week or month-to-month reinvestment rates or trying to taper it. actually think, again, this is not a first-order macro or financial event.  I think what we really need to do is just execute a plan.  One of the lessons I took-I from events-was that once we started executing the taper, it that we really need to worry as much about market functioning around the ending of the reinvestment.  Obviously, if there were real problems in market functioning, those should be taken into account.

Eurodollar transactions as an rate.  The rate on actual federal funds transactions, which would of course take Fourth, I support publishing the expanded rate that includes additional advantage of the new FR-2420, would remain the basis of our communications, in my view. Focusing on fed funds transactions is simpler to communicate and should be fine for monetary

June 17-18, 2014

monetary policy target.  But, again, I am all for developing that. control.  And the expanded rate might be more precise but offers limited benefits at this point in terms of our

Kocherlakota and President Evans earlier about learning, think we should start the normalization with familiar tools and terminology, wherever a reversal. Let me finish up with some broader observations linked to some comments from the previous meeting and from President language, and war-gaming.  We are going to learn a lot about this after we start this process.  So, again, I possible, and later changes then can be an evolution and not we use in the revised exit principles should not lock us in range for the funds rate now would provide of future more explicit that the rate target.  So rather than reverse repo the federal funds rate target range-'the Committee Given that, the language unnecessarily.  For example, highlighting a flexibility, and we can later narrow that range to a point, if it's appropriate.  In terms statement language, draft 3', which provides a fed funds range, could be reverse repo facility supports the implementation of our federal funds saying, 'The Committee authorizes the Open Market Desk to execute overnight agreements at a rate of 30 basis points,' I would prefer to say something like, 'Consistent with this decision'-the decision about authorizes the Open Market Desk to execute the reverse repo operations.'

really open question is, where do we want this spread to be-and also, much take-up do we really want from this I do think a getting back to Governor Tarullo's comments, how facility?  Those, again, are things we will learn when we are actually doing it.  Right now, we can maybe just guess.

Kocherlakota said in April, and as President Evans brought up, I really need to think through or wargame some of these scenarios, and the scenarios are more interesting are not like the fall of 2008.  In the fall of 2008, you're cutting And finally, as President do think we that I think

June 17-18, 2014

interest rates to zero.  That's kind of a no-brainer from a stress situation like in the Asian financial crisis and around that time, maybe even and early 2008, when there were runs to safe assets but we actually had a target fed trying to deal with the fact that there is dislocation in the reverse repo or the how these various arrangements and also how these caps the funds rate to zero.  You're driving all the point of view of thinking about some of these issues around market operations.  So you think more about late 2007 funds rate that was significantly above zero.  So then you start thinking about scenarios in which you are trying to maintain monetary policy control for dual-mandate reasons, at the same time that you are Treasury market, and thinking about could actually work.

President Evans was pushing arguments along this line.  And I do think we interest rates in addition to the actual meeting-is the credibility or the war-gaming this, we have to be realistic and think about than what we would declare.  I think this is something we should just continue to discuss and think about.  Thank you very much. I think that should be thinking through those, and how we expect it would work, and to what extent we would need to have monetary policy decisions changing the functioning of the facilities as set up.  Obviously, the big question that has come up a number of times-President Kocherlakota brought it up at the previous time-inconsistency of these caps.  In how we would really behave in these stress scenarios, rather that

to the at the Hotel Okura Brainard, I had the MR. FISHER.  If I may, Madam Chair, I'd first like to welcome two old friends Committee, Stan Fischer and Lael Brainard, and I suggest that we garnish Governor Fischer's substantial new wages to pay me back for all the times he used the treadmill and charged it to my room over in the-  [Laughter]  And as to Governor pleasure of working with her-actually, under her tight control-for four years during the Clinton Administration.  So I want to welcome both of you.

do want to give credit to everybody that prepared those with that in mind, bearing in mind again, as I mentioned earlier, that in the old days, we in essence are only one-quarter or maybe one-fifth of the credit as we process these different questions. As I mentioned in the previous meeting, we are in the process of evolution.  I went back to Roosa, Volcker, Sternlight, Fisher, and now you, Simon Potter-obviously this discussion has informed this evolution enormously.  I found the previous meeting and this meeting, particularly the first parts of these meetings, to be enormously informative and very, very helpful, as well as the papers that were delivered, and I papers and thank them for them.  But I do think we need to proceed deliberately, and I'm going to answer the questions unlike system, and we have to be mindful of that fact am in full agreement with Governor Tarullo's statement and also, Rosengren.  But to the principal tool to affect I was captivated by and shockingly, increasingly over time thinking more and more like President start out with question 1, I do think we ought to use the IOER rate as

June 17-18, 2014

rates.  I have a concern about the ON RRP program.  I want to talk about that in just a that basically the principal tool to affect interest rates is the IOER rate. interest second, but I do think had today it as a circuit breaker.  I think that makes eminent sense.  I have concerns, types, there's a little bit of a 'more the merrier' tune memo that was written in terms of the review of the counterparty think we have to be careful here.  I think there a clear and principled dividing line between those with access to that facility and Chair, are so many possible counterparties, this could grow limitations and definitions are.  I'm not saying we should not with what the order of dimension will be. With regard to the ON RRP program, I was affected by the discussion we about using however-and I hope the New York Desk will forgive me-I don't mean this critically, but when, for example, we looked at exhibit 4, item number 22, and you mentioned your option was to add more counterparties of the current that comes through the framework for overnight RRP operations, and I ought to be those without.  We could discuss what that dividing line should be.  My concern, Madam is that-and maybe this is what Governor Tarullo was saying-I don't have a sense of final dimension here.  And I'm worried, given the fact that there and given the fact that we're one-quarter or one-fifth of the credit system, that like Topsy and maybe grow slightly out of control.  We can't be all things to all people, and we have to figure out what the strict have RRP operations, but I personally struggle

that, if we had a clear and principled dividing line, we would include money market funds.  I could make a case for excluding the money market funds.  But I am a little bit worried that if we just keep adding more, we in a place of being too much a part of the market, and I just Desk and to the rest of the folks at the table. I could make a case depository institutions-our traditional Fed partners-the Federal Home Loan Banks, the housing GSEs, and government prime might create something that puts us wanted to voice that honestly and frankly to the

June 17-18, 2014

issue of reinvestment of principal, I think President Rosengren makes much as we want to define forward pointed out, we've had two goes at it before.  This is very much a matter of With regard to the a very good point.  I view that as a signaling device, and as guidance with specificity, as much as we try to define an exit principle with great specificity, as President Rosengren feel.

in today's discussion.  The old way to would feel comfortable moving the base rate up once we see the whites of the eyes of a mandate.  There may be a utility in using the reinvestment rate, depending on how the economy evolves, as President Rosengren said. think it makes a huge difference in terms of affecting the size of the balance sheet, but it would be in favor of keeping open the option of tapering back our send a signal to the market that we're increasingly confident and it's a bridge to raising thing I feel very strongly about, and I've discussed this with you Chair, is that when we decide to raise the base rate, I don't want to do things in a to do it by a quarter-point or maybe less than a quarter-point my feelings on the reinvestment of principal. The term 'war-gaming' has been used quite a bit conduct a war is, you didn't shoot until you saw the whites of the eyes of your opponents.  With modern technology and modern modeling and so on, that's been affected, but I mention that only because I full recovery and meeting the dual tool as we feel more confident, but don't quite have the absolute level of confidence we would need to raise the base I don't is a signaling device.  I repurchases-I think, President Rosengren, you used the phrase 'symmetric reduction'-in order to the base rate.  Because the other offline, Madam sudden, old-fashioned way.  I'd like at a time.  So those are am in favor of continuing to publish something very much like bank funding rate that would capture in the overnight Eurodollar market.  We had a little discussion there, clarified and then As to the fourth point, I the current funds rate, but maybe described as the overnight trades

June 17-18, 2014

the limiting to domestic and U.S. offices of foreign institutions could blunt the political criticism we might confused by our great legal counsel, but I'm basically arguing the case that option 1 might be the easiest thing to do from the standpoint of the transactional commitments that exist in marketplace.  And I think one of the benefits of that would be that institutions receive if there was a sense that we were providing a facility that's unduly influenced by foreign borrowing costs.

Chair, and I realize they're not all that specific, but go through time. Those are my overall views, Madam we're still feeling our way through this, and we'll get more specific as we Thank you very much.

MR. POTTER.  Option 1 has us printing two rates, the fed funds classic and the overnight bank funding rate.  There's a little bit of confusion about that.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lockhart.

June 17-18, 2014

Chair.  The discussion so far has been useful and many complexities and subtleties, and when presented with a number of clear-cut, my approach is to pose some framing questions or as a way to sort through the options. MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam illuminating.  There are tradeoffs in which the choice isn't tests to allow tactical adaptation as we learn; and, third, simplicity and together. My tests are, first, the probability of achieving control over short-term rates; second, where feasible, some flexibility clarity of communications.  When I go through the questions I will reorder them a little bit and bunch some

funds rate or administered rates, first, I and trying to preserve in that construct the use of the in the early stages.  So I favor the second of the two staff memo.  I see it as giving us the best chance of exerting control over go this way, a first order of business will be to construct statements that as possible, given all the moving parts.  I think the 3' verbiage in the illustrative time meet the test of clarity and simplicity. On the question of the emphasis on the federal expect we're going to settle on using alternate rates for both monetary control communications purposes, and I think it's worth fed funds rate.  I favor beginning with a target range for the federal funds rate, since it is now familiar and probably more workable options presented in the short-term rates.  If we are as clear of liftoff statement would is the question about publishing an expanded fed of the target funds rate, that leads me to thinking that we should include in our planning the scenario in which we to a balance sheet of a size at which reserves are relatively scarce.  So I don't know if Now I'll go to question 4, and that funds rate definition.  I'm open to an expanded federal funds rate, including an expansion that incorporates Eurodollar transactions, along with nonbrokered fed funds transactions.  At the same time I think we should aim for the most durable definition possible and return

June 17-18, 2014

in coming deliberations. including Eurodollar transactions presents any issue in such a scenario, and this is the kind of question I think we can sort out the staff took a mostly neutral position memos, but on this question I thought the staff went pretty a decisive consideration, this implement in terms of IT systems in the memo.  Some of my other duties in the System make me to such a statement.  I'd like to spend more time on this question of limits and circuit On question 2, about circuit breakers-I thought in the presentation of options in the far in pushing a cap on aggregate usage paired with a uniform-price auction mechanism.  I think this is a sensible place to start.  Although this is perhaps not approach strikes me as simpler and less problematic to adjustments, as was pointed out attentive breakers leading up to the July decision point, and I hope we can ask follow-up questions of the staff during the period before the next meeting.

reinvestment question-ceasing simultaneously or with liftoff is clearest and conveys greater conviction, but I'm open to doing it after of tightening goes.  I wound down based on tactical considerations transition represented by liftoff has been accomplished.  This, I think, is an area in Thank you, Madam Chair. The third question, which I'll treat as the last one, is the reinvestments or taking a graduated approach.  Ending reinvestments coincident liftoff because I think this buys some time to observe how the first phase think the reinvestment program can be ended or after the which tactical flexibility is feasible.

not, but I actually share a lot of his views, as my remarks.  But before I address the specific questions under consideration, I'd to state some of my general views regarding the normalization of policy. MR. PLOSSER.  I'm afraid I'm going to have to agree with a lot of he said.  [Laughter] Now, if that forces him to recant all that-I hope you'll see in like to me that a lot of our discussion recently about our exit and normalization are rates.  I'm a bit uncomfortable with the to which these concerns are driving our policy options.  Historically, volatility in the funds operational feature of monetary policy, and I see no compelling reason we should expect that that volatility will with our broad macroeconomic mandate. It appears overly concerned with the daily volatility in overnight extent rate has always been an why we can't continue to accept volatility or why impede our ability to carry out policy consistent

and to essentially sidestep the legal restriction on paying interest on is not a depository institution.  I fear doing so could potentially have Also, I'm reluctant to move to conducting monetary policy operations with a large set of nonbank counterparties reserves to anyone that some unpleasant political ramifications.

June 17-18, 2014

to restate my guiding principle that any near-term tactical decisions we make prefer or will rely on other instruments to monetary policy on a regular or routine basis.  Special facilities, such as the TDF or repo facility, should be viewed and communicated as temporary and I also want should leave open the option of returning to a corridor system of some kind based on the fed funds rate or perhaps a more broadly defined interbank rate sometime in the future, which is my preferred way of conducting policy.  This means I probably would not support any communication or tactical steps that suggest we administer the overnight reverse shelved when not absolutely necessary.

mind, in the interim as we shrink the balance sheet, I would rely primarily on specify a range for the funds rate as we've been if we expanded the range of that federal funds rate-maybe it doesn't need to be can be 40 basis points.  We can have a broad range initially. may indicate that we would use other tools at our disposal-intentionally vague run to ensure that the federal funds rate or our expanded definition doesn't range.  That would keep the ON RRP a smaller facility, at least in the near to shrink the funds rate target range as we get more comfortable with our ability to With that in the IOER administered rate, but then I would doing for the past five years.  It's not new anymore.  In doing that, I would be inclined and even comfortable 20 or 25 basis points.  Maybe it And then we there-in the short fall below that broad term.  As we gain more experience, we will find out if that works, and whether we need to employ the ON RRP rate to keep the funds rate in its target range.  As we raise rates, we might be able conduct monetary policy by having the IOER rate raise rates.

would also be comfortable with expanding or extending the definition of the to include Eurodollar transactions.  I'll note that, in exhibit 20 from the had this morning, if you look at the period between 2010 and 2014 when there was a As I said, I effective funds rate briefing we

I think proceeding along these system that targets the domestic interbank rate.  I'd also note that as a governance matter, FOMC and the Board of Governors IOER rate would be set, and how that would be set relative time as we can return to

the ON RRP rate specifically.  I believe that relying on We do not know the consequences for the microeconomic structure of already witnessing an increase in demand from many people who wish to do that.  So there must be financial benefits to this, or at least in some sense encouraging a huge demand for this So I prefer this option to targeting the ON RRP rate is risky. short-term funding markets, or who's being helped or harmed by us crowding into this market in such a big way.  We are to be counterparties.  Why is that?  I don't suspect they're doing it out of patriotism.  I suspect there's a financial reason why they'd like and we could be artificially creating product.

the consequences of that be, both intended this have to do with operating monetary policy and achieving I previously mentioned, I'm very uncomfortable with the fact that But who are we squeezing out, and what will and unintended?  And what does our macroeconomic goals?  As we are engaging, I think, in a backdoor practice of paying interest on reserves to nondepository institutions.

June 17-18, 2014

designing our monetary policy instruments and operating procedures and using a financial-stability reasons-I think we're conflating those two. ON RRP facility as a tool for should be that. ought to be monetary policy instrument for Even today I heard people moving back and forth between the monetary policy and as a tool to meet liquidity needs in the case of a crisis.  I think we very careful about for to a prefer fewer counterparties and probably aggregate caps.  The size of the than one that's dynamic.  I think our So with respect to question 2, as I said, I am opposed to a full-allotment program reverse repos.  If we choose to use reverse repos at all as a tactical tool during a transition smaller balance sheet, I cap should be an FOMC decision.  Simplicity would be desirable, and thus, probably, I would start with an aggregate cap that's static rather communications are hard enough without explaining how we're going to dynamically adjust some kind of cap.

the fact that the overnight reverse repo facility seems to be making it balance sheets at the end of the quarter.  I don't this facility seems to be least some institutions to do that.  That gives me pause to think a counterparty cap might be appropriate as well, and I'm open to thinking I do not like convenient for some institutions to dress up their see that as a macroeconomic goal or role for the Federal Reserve, but providing great support for at about whether or not further about that.  Again, simplicity, I think, is going to be valuable.

I would urge us to play down the role of the ON RRP facility as much as we can.  It balance is a bit awkward at best for us to be entertaining an in which money market funds are the major transmitter of monetary policy, Like President Rosengren, I think it operating system

That does suggest to me that shrinking the about this further-just considering government-only money market funds as counterparties if we choose to go in that am in favor of terminating our reinvestments in a prompt manner taper has ended.  As many people have mentioned, the process of reducing or tapering told the markets what we were going to do, has come off pretty to taper and shrink the balance sheet, and I would be open to that-in fact, I even would Regarding question 3, I after the our purchases, once we smoothly, and I would be inclined just to keep on going.

And as some people have argued, very large carry trade right now, and we're going to have to unwind that will be costs to bear when we do that.  I'll have some more to say about maybe we shifting our reinvestments into short-term Treasuries that would allow us a little sheet as we move forward in time.  That might be a step to structure and exit. I'd also like maturity structure of the balance sheet.  We have a political risk, I think, as we are in the midst of a at some point, and there this later, but one thing that we might consider as we think about reinvestment is ought to be more flexibility on our balance manage our balance sheet's maturity let me reiterate that I'm supportive of extending the definition of the interbank that we target.

MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  And thanks to the staff for excellent analysis of complex financial products and financial engineering of some of these tools.

the staff's overview assessment of the Committee's consensus position from to reduce monetary accommodation, the Committee expects rate can be expected to trade within an indicated range. I agree with April.  When it becomes appropriate to employ our IOER and overnight RRP tools with a relatively wide spread between them, so that federal funds in our prior policy environment, circa money rates is a useful approach.  That term.  And even if we did, I would I will expand upon shortly. As long as our balance sheet remains larger than 2007, using the overnight RRP tool to firm up short-term said, I do not favor moving to a floor system for the longer not favor a permanent ON RRP program, for reasons that

it is crucial that the language announcing our use of the ON RRP program and temporary nature of our use of ON RRPs during our policy normalization assume it is here for good and make costly market investments.  At that point, we will almost surely accept that our credibility will require So I think our exit strategy should emphasize the temporary duration of this policy tool.  We should be explicit about the period.  Otherwise, market participants will structure us to maintain the overnight RRP program indefinitely.

to avoid this eventual and unplanned fait accompli outcome, we need to be this is a temporary facility.  Let me be clear: market, and I would prefer not using it at all, if that were our policy settings, the overnight In order explicit, now and throughout the program's use, that I worry about the complexity of this reasonable.  Over the transition period, while we renormalize

June 17-18, 2014

to hit a target for the funds rate, and that is an actions to minimize financial instability risks over can see some benefits to using the program temporarily.  But over the term, I don't see the benefits, certainly not relative to the possibly large costs of increased program can be an insurance policy that helps us important benefit.  As long as we take prudent this transition period, I longer financial instability.

is a big payoff to having a permanent overnight RRP program, now time to provide that important quantitative and persuasive analysis.  Maybe I'm overly risk and there are actually important benefits.  But I think a compelling affirmative case still made for this program to be used permanently. If anyone thinks there is the averse, needs to be heightened risk full-allotment program could lead to destabilizing withdrawals of funding from lending institutions to avoid exposure to credit instruments with even the memos discussed aggregate caps, individual caps, discussions did an unusually good funding markets during times of stress. As the briefing memos discuss, there is a potential for the overnight RRP program to generate financial instability problems.  For example, during a period of aversion, a money funds and other modest credit risk.  To address these risks, dynamic and flexible caps, and other circuit breakers.  These job of convincing me that this new financial instrument is much too complicated.  We just don't know how it's going to interact with other short-term

monetary policy, we simply need more analysis of how such an interest rate tool would affect during normal times under various stress scenarios-that is, during is 4 percent or more, but we face a stress scenario. For a temporary implementation of this program, I would favor an aggregate static cap for simplicity.  Before we find ourselves endgamed with a permanent overnight RRP instrument for our policy effectiveness normal times when the funds rate

June 17-18, 2014

focusing a lot of my attention on the possibility that this program will be 10 years from now.  My misgivings mean that I have to know one heck of a lot more effectiveness of this new policy tool, its social value, and its use as a new financial today that would likely lead to it becoming a Obviously, I am around 5 or about the product before I can imagine undertaking actions permanent operational fixture.

In the absence of a strong and compelling case for a longer-term only a temporary use of should authorize SOMA balance sheet will approximately return to normal, and no longer we continue well after we begin our interest rate tightening.  Given the list of policy watch liftoff decision itself. Now, let me turn to reinvestments.  I prefer changing our strategy so that reinvesting maturing proceeds until long duration of our SOMA portfolio, I don't believe there is a material change in the degree of accommodation that is provided under the various timing possibilities for reinvestments.  I think signaling our policy intentions is simpler and cleaner if we reduce the variables to just the interest rate

all together for the sake of being clear about my preferred approach, here is are found in paragraph 3 liftoff policy statement example in the planning memo.  At the appropriate due to large excess reserves during our extended policy normalization period, the effective perhaps.  So this is like paragraph 3 but with a and an expected trading range.  Basically, we announce the target funds Putting this how I could see the FOMC policy statement emerging.  Key ingredients of the illustrative time, I would state that the Committee decided to increase its target funds rate to 0.25 percent. But funds rate may range from 15 to 40 basis points, target federal funds rate rate, and we admit upfront that during the normalization process trading may occur in the range

June 17-18, 2014

target.  Now, I have heard all the conversation so far, and it strikes me that a range is consensus for the funds rate.  So that is okay.  In this case, I am okay with IOER rate to 40 basis points. IOER alone could do most of the tightening work for us, and I with the overnight RRP rate at 15 basis points and not being that if the funds rate trades a little below 25 basis points.  Of course, if the 25 basis points, we could raise the overnight rate around the what is going to be the using the existing language in paragraph 3 on the Committee authorizing the overnight RRP rate to be within a range of 15 to 25 basis points and setting the However, I would hope that would favor starting out anxious to increase it funds rate was persistently far below somewhat.

funds rate that includes Eurodollars.  I am open to arguments from the Let me add that I have not come to a firm view about whether we should target an expanded version of the technical experts.

conclude by saying that I think it's obvious that engineering a smooth in short-term policy rates with our enormous balance sheet will be fraught with times we will see markets both overreact and underreact to our policy-tightening moves. compound the challenges of our task with an unrealistic as we draw it up on the board.  Let's deal Finally, let me increase temporary obstacles and challenges.  I think we need to be very explicit in accepting that at various It's going to happen.  Let's not expectation that policy adjustment will go 100 percent with the known unknowns as best we can and react as prudently as possible when the unknown unknowns arise.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

floor and push up from below, if needed.  Today, IOER is at 25 basis points, federal ON RRP rate is set at 5 basis points.  So this rates.  Of course, that managing short-term rates with IOER pulling up from above and the ON RRP facility available to provide a funds are trading around 10 basis points, and the really just means moving the whole structure upward as the Committee tightens policy, and it ought to give the Committee a reasonable level of control over short-term remains to be seen.

it as a given for purposes of this discussion-that the development of an improved measure for the federal funds rate based on to target a federal the one we would target.  I would find it odd that we would do all the work to it out there and then not have the confidence to target it, but instead not sure how we would explain that.  So that's going to be my It also seems likely-and I take Committee will support the FR-2420 data and including Eurodollar transactions.  And I assume-I had assumed, anyway-that if we go to the trouble of creating this rate, and then choose funds rate, that is create this thing and put target the old one.  I'm assumption for this purpose.

For me, the facility is just a tool to provide a floor for rates, and it need been thinking that it limited purpose. I also have to say that I share the discomfort with the potential for the RRP facility to get very large very quickly. not be a perfect floor.  Nothing more.  As I said at the last meeting, I have could be small and tailored for that been raised is, is that possible?  If you go back to memo, a facility that is sized off a trailing one-week average of usage capacity, it still could get very and the effect on industry structures would be unpredictable at best.  I also don't know that Really, though, the question that has what's discussed in the volume with a $300 billion cushion could grow enormously very quickly, obviously.  And even if you lengthened the averaging period and lowered the surge large,

real answer to the fact that the caps would come under huge pressure in a crisis-I breakers-and that the see that in advance and plan on it. there is any would characterize them as speed bumps, others have called them circuit market will would prefer to to say, let's wait to make decisions about counterparties until to do, but not threaten to become something that we really don't want-that I don't So I have those concerns, and from the standpoint of the counterparties, I choose the first option, which is there is significantly more discussion on how we can create an ON RRP facility that will do what we need it want, let's say.

a role for IOER, for the federal funds rate, and for the first is whether to target the either a point or a range or, instead, to target short-term rates. options are there in paragraphs 3, 3', and 3", and-no surprise-my desire would be to use 3'. Within that general framework, with the ON RRP facility, there are some choices to be made, and improved federal funds rate as The the ON RRP facility only as needed, and that pushes me in the direction of was perhaps suggesting, though-that a point target around the federal funds rate, and the tools are as supporting characters.  In option 3", the communication is very different and is really the federal I find it a plausible idea to target the I don't like the idea of as the primary actors in the play, if you will.  And I would say I do like the idea of thinking of IOER as the principal tool. I would echo what President Evans with expected volatility around it kind of approaches a range in the limit.  And also, in these formulations, in 3 and 3', the communication is there focused on the administered rates, and the general level of short-term rates, including funds rate, is kind of an afterthought.  Let me say that general level of short-term rates including the federal funds rate, but featuring the administered rates that

June 17-18, 2014

the publish the improved version and call it the federal funds it later.  My preference is what I would call the it the federal funds rate.  The work of covers some of these same issues, and maybe it can shed some light by The second issue is whether to continue to publish the old federal funds rate alongside new and improved version or to just rate, and take the old federal funds rate off the market, put it out to pasture-pick your metaphor-but have it out there in case we need one-rate solution, which is to publish the new rate and call the LIBOR reform effort analogy.

reform effort has included a Market Participants Group established by the Committee (OSSC) of the FSB and led by Darrell Duffie, a well-known market participants of all different varieties.  Noting the recommend the federal funds rate as a reference rate without an improved that the federal funds rate is at risk of not meeting the standards for 7 of the IOSCO benchmark principles requires that a benchmark in real transactions in an active market.  In addition, the LIBOR Market Participants wider range of transactions and counterparties, and that it be anchored in real kind of a direct parallel to federal funds reform.  Market participants the old LIBOR alive and created a new rate with these they preferred a rate that is called LIBOR, but that is no limited to London or to interbank lending, and it's not an offered rate either [laughter] but, anchored in real transactions. The LIBOR Official Sector Steering academic, and it included financial current state of play in the federal funds market, the Market Participants Group said that 'it would hesitate to fixing.'  And one critical test a reference rate is that principle be anchored Group recommended-and the OSSC agrees-that the definition of LIBOR should be broadened to include a transactions.  And this is did not prefer an option that kept improved characteristics.  Instead, longer rather, is

June 17-18, 2014

it reformed, and naming it something else.  In addition, I don't really think it's less confusing or just a level of complexity that I don't think we need. I don't say this is dispositive, but it suggests to me that market participants have concerns about the federal funds rate as a reliable benchmark and would probably like to see which I believe would mean changing the definition of the federal funds rate, rather than creating a new rate easier for market participants to have two rates out there.  I don't know how you explain that. It's issue we talked about earlier is the contract frustration issue, which, as I as a serious concern and shouldn't be the thing that pushes us around in the federal funds rate.  It will The other mentioned, I don't see this issue.  So where that leaves me is, I favor one rate to be called include Eurodollars and the FR-2420 transactions.

that limiting the size and effect of the facility over time.  But, an aggregate cap with a single-price to allocate capacity if the cap is hit.  I'd like that cap to be rigid.  I think I'd like it to be surge capacity, to be low-no more than $50 billion.  And I I don't think I in capacity. Turning to the second question from the appendix, as I mentioned, I'm less sure circuit breakers can be successful in nonetheless, this is how I would make the tradeoffs.  I'd like auction static.  I'd like X, which is to say the would allow indulgences for quarter-end and other scheduled events like that. would see those as reasons to trip the surge capacity.  I would look more for changes got several concerns about ceasing reinvestments I think this could correctly be seen as the beginning of is a risk of a market reaction that might actually have the effect of pushing liftoff date.  Now, I don't know that, but let me say that after the last two major decisions me to feel like I have a lot of confidence in predicting how the market would think people Finally, moving to reinvestment, I've soon after the taper ends.  First, tightening, and there out the it is very hard for take this signal.  If you look back to, for example, the June meeting last year, I

June 17-18, 2014

market reaction.  Then comes the actual taper at the end of the I will say I overestimated what would happen.  I think that taper was clearly well all expected by the market.  But who thought that the stock So, I would say, same lesson, different sign, in both cases. the possibility of a market reaction that might push out the liftoff date. pretty widely underestimated the year, and justified on the economics, but not at market would close up 300 points? But in any case, there is time to tighten raising rates less. Second, even if that doesn't happen, to me the highest priority when it is policy is to get away from the effective lower bound.  And so for any given amount of tightening, using both tools by definition means that we'll be

think that using both tools at the same time can be confusing. Third, I

terminating our reinvestments in MBS, which amount probably at a modest amount, and I just don't think that higher mortgage rates are in the economy.  For that reason, I am open to the idea of smoothing the the taper is a good one.  I don't have a great answer on that one. And, finally, I am concerned that to a substantial part of projected gross issuance, could well flow through into higher mortgage rates, albeit what we need right now taper.  I also think that the idea of creating an agreed path for know that I

to stop reinvestments well after liftoff, and I would avoid hard and at is, for example, 1 percent, which feels like about the end of 2015 in that time.  But I do think it would be helpful to take it off the table for now, focus on and getting away from the zero lower bound, and return to it near the end of 2015. Finally, I would prefer complex triggers.  One approach would be to state an intention to hold the balance sheet stable least until the target rate case.  Or you could take a softer approach and defer to Committee judgment as to when is the appropriate raising rates Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman. CHAIR

June 17-18, 2014

DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  It's probably appropriate for issue of reinvestment.  As I noted in a speech last month, I think there are of short-term rates VICE CHAIRMAN me to begin with the some compelling reasons for ending reinvestments sometime after liftoff rather than before or coincident with liftoff.

mind, ending reinvestments later, after liftoff, serves four purposes.  First, it the risk of foreshortening the entire tightening process.  If we were to end reinvestments the risk of both raising long-term rates, especially to the extent that people than stocks, and also raising the expected trajectory of short-term rates it would pull forward people's expectations in terms of the probability of liftoff, and the would be pulled forward in time.  Thus, I think ending reinvestments first could tightening of financial conditions that might be more than we desire or the economic expansion, and that could actually delay the liftoff the be greater than we anticipate, and if it was greater than we desired, it might be risk of an overly-large market response. In my lessens before liftoff, then the end of reinvestments would be viewed as the beginning of the tightening process.  That runs emphasize flows rather because timing of liftoff lead to a significant anticipate.  That could disrupt of short-term interest rates.  Similarly, if we end reinvestment and commence liftoff together, effect could awkward, if we're doing both together, to then reverse course.  I also think separating the two decisions reduces the could conceivably delay liftoff in certain is inconsistent with our goal of getting off the zero lower bound as soon as in order to regain monetary policy flexibility.  It seems to me that getting off the zero Second, because ending reinvestments first states of the world, it possible lower bound as soon as possible, consistent with our dual-mandate objectives, should be a goal of policy, as that would provide greater flexibility in terms of responding to future shocks.

June 17-18, 2014

think delaying the end of reinvestments also should simplify our communications interest rates-rather than two.  Also, the same time, I think assess what the particular effect is of each instrument. Third, I as we lift off.  There will be one moving part-short-term if we're adjusting both short-term rates and the size of the balance sheet at it would be more difficult for us to two scenarios:  reinvestments end before liftoff versus the end of after liftoff.  Now, assume that, in these two scenarios, the might the expectations about the end of reinvestments to be pushed out.  That would would act as an automatic stabilizer in terms of And, fourth, ending reinvestments later also strikes me as a better risk-management strategy.  Let's compare reinvestments is delayed until economy subsequently disappoints.  In the first case, when we end reinvestments first, we have to reverse course.  In the second case, ending reinvestments later, disappointment about outlook would cause keep the balance sheet larger for longer, and that supporting economic activity, which I think would be desirable.

how to specify the end of reinvestments, my original thinking was maybe to as a threshold or a trigger, but after talking to the Vice that retaining some flexibility was a better rates are raised significantly above zero and the FOMC is its dual-mandate objectives.  I'm not wedded to any particular relatively vague so we have some flexibility makes more sense. In terms of specify a level of interest rates Chairman-not myself, but Stan-I concluded approach.  So I would favor general language to the effect that reinvestment is expected to continue until short-term interest significantly closer to meeting language, but I think keeping it So, Stan, you did convince me.

depends on reinvestment in 2015, you probably would end it amount of maturing agency MBS is pretty modest, about $20 billion per In terms of ending reinvestments all at once or more gradually, I think that timing and circumstances.  If you were to adjust outright because the

June 17-18, 2014

you might want to taper it because you're not really sure circumstances of the economy at think we have to really foreshadow exactly how we at this point in time. month.  But if the end of reinvestment doesn't occur until 2016, then you're talking about a much bigger end, and so in that case what such a large end might mean.  I also think the particular the time would be very important.  So I don't would do it to focus on is the federal funds rate.  Here I have a strong part of the calculation, and I want to substitute this new methodology rather than having a new rate and an old rate.  I favor single improved rate. The second issue I want preference for revamping how we calculate the effective funds rate, adding the overnight Eurodollar borrowing as for the current effective federal funds rate moving to a

moving to a single improved rate helps us we make the switch, then we have more robust that trillions of dollars of derivatives contracts reference.  If we keep the have this problem that we have all of these derivative referencing this old, infirm rate.  I think we found with LIBOR that there's a rate, yet people all of their derivatives contracts.  So I would prefer to avoid the problem by just actually giving people an improved rate, and then it happens simultaneously and we're done with that problem. As Governor Powell has pointed out, considerably with the federal funds rate as a reference rate.  If a rate that's old rate and have a new rate, we still contracts tremendous amount of inertia.  Everyone knows LIBOR is a troubled reference are still using LIBOR in of forcing the transition to the new reference rate reference the switch as large, relative to the risks of contract My reading is that the contract frustration risks are very low because most contracts of the substance, the new rate will be very close.  Over the I view the benefits of forcing frustration. simply say the effective federal funds rate is what the Federal Reserve says the effective federal funds rate is.  And, second, in terms

June 17-18, 2014

terms of the difference in the two rates, it seems like past four years, it averages less than 1 basis point difference from the old federal funds rate.  So both in terms of the legal reading but also in just moving to the new rate makes the most sense.

issue that changing to the new rate will make it hard down the road to heard people express that as a think this exaggerates the degree of difficulty of in the future.  If the federal funds rate market think it wouldn't be that hard to move back to moving back to the old definition because the reasons.  I don't think that constrains us very much. With respect to the move back to the old definition of the federal funds rate-I concern once our balance sheet normalizes-I going back to the old federal funds rate sometime deepens again as our balance sheet normalizes, I the old definition and just explain that we're now funds market is much deeper now.  It's a much better reference rate.  It's much less idiosyncratic. And so we're moving back for those issue I want to discuss is the issue of our target.  My own view is that we of money market rates rather than the federal funds rate. funds rate has gotten pretty idiosyncratic.  I'm with Governor Fischer on this-why what we really care about in terms the general level of money market rates to actually influence to emphasize the general level of money market to throw it out, that over actually the overnight RRP rate, because those are administered rates. The third should be targeting the general level The federal are we holding onto this thing as a vestige of times past when of setting monetary policy is setting financial market conditions?  So I would prefer rates-and we could keep the federal funds rate around, you know, we don't have but I would emphasize general money market rates.  I think I'd prefer emphasizing the IOER rate or

do want to avoid, though, is having the Desk try to pin the federal funds rate overnight RRP and IOER rates around on a day-to-day basis. really see the benefit, in terms of affecting financial conditions, of small movements of One thing I to a particular level and moving the I don't

June 17-18, 2014

rates just to try to pin the federal funds rate to a particular rate.  I think that the control of financial market conditions, and so the market rates, and as long as the rates stay within that administered rates except when you're these administered what we really have to emphasize here is simplest regime that generates good control of financial market conditions is what I'm for.  So that means a range for general money range, then I wouldn't see that you'd need to adjust the trying to implement a policy change.

are lots of ways to do it.  My emphasis would be on having caps that do overnight RRP facility, to limit the upward spikes in riskier money a way that creates unnecessary frictions in peacetime just to be slightly The fourth issue is with respect to caps on the overnight RRP facility.  I think the staff made it very clear there not bind in peacetime, or noncrisis periods, but bind in wartime-crisis periods when we want to limit the inflow into the market rates.  I want a regime that's well designed for the most common case, peacetime, rather than overengineered in better in wartime situations that might never occur.

to design a very complex mechanism that only is relevant on one day out of mind, an ideal regime would have no caps in limit that you would never expect to reach, and then in market conditions when stress I think we're overemphasizing, a little bit, the risk of this future financial crisis, and I don't want 1,000 days.  It just seems sort of backward.  In my peacetime, except for a high overall wartime a system of caps that was automatically triggered by conditions developed.

in interest rates.  So if the spread between risky rates and risk-free rates caps automatically come into place.  Now, I know the staff hasn't proposed this.  It's risk that you might not be In other words, what I'd prefer to have is an arrangement in which the caps automatically get triggered by a spread widens, the probably too complicated to be easily realized.  You'd always have the

June 17-18, 2014

a regime like this was feasible, but I'm going to confine my remaining staff memo. sure that the caps would be forthcoming in all circumstances.  I would encourage the staff to consider whether comments to the construct as outlined in the

Individual caps have the benefit of certainty for the caps have the value that you get the pooling advantage, and so they're the sense from reading the staff's report that they lean in the aggregate caps.  I certainly get a sense around the table that we as a collective group I would generally be pretty indifferent between individual caps and aggregate caps.  It seems like the staff nailed the distinction. investor.  The aggregate more efficient in that sense.  I get direction of lean in favor of aggregate caps.  So I'm perfectly happy to go with the sense of the Committee and go with an aggregate cap.

a few thoughts on the whole issue of the overnight RRP facility, lot of comments today.  I think the consensus around the table, as I hear it, is to establish a floor on rates to enhance our monetary policy control, but we want to keep it pretty small in terms of its in the market.  And so that implies that we're going to have to keep the spread a spread of 20 or even 30 basis points would effective in terms of setting a floor and maintaining monetary policy control.  I think that we weren't going to get a facility that was in some sense.  I don't view, in the context of the U.S. financial system, a facility that is assets is, but it's probably $60 trillion.  So if you had a facility that was would be not large but pretty trivial in the context of the U.S. economy. Finally, I have just which has gotten a that we want to use the overnight RRP facility credibility in terms of footprint relatively wide to limit take-up.  My view is that probably be if we did that we could be pretty comfortable large $200 billion or $300 billion as large.  I don't know what the total amount of financial outstanding in the United States $200 billion, I think that

June 17-18, 2014

permanent, but I would prefer would just keep it open.  I think really going to bind future Committees.  And so I think I'd keep it open and not lean in terms of what's going to happen over the longer term.  Thank you, Also, I think we should make no commitment to making it not to make a commitment to making it temporary, either.  I we're going to learn by having this facility in place, and maybe it will work better, in more miraculous ways, than we anticipate, or maybe it will work worse, and I don't think anything we say today is one way or the other Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George. CHAIR

GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Like others, I found the discussion from with how the Chair has described a centrist this. MS. April and again today to be very helpful, and I remain open to considering this mix of tools as we go through normalization.  I am very comfortable approach in thinking about we'll need to be clearer about our intentions regarding the that the staff included of possible hold no more securities monetary policy efficiently and effectively is in brackets, which discuss.  My own view remains generally principles that we affirmed just last year, which say that we intend to I do think, though, that ultimate size of the balance sheet.  When I look at the draft revised policy normalization principles, the phrase that indicates we will than necessary to implement suggests it's an issue that we're going to need to consistent with the 2011 eventually hold no more securities than needed and reduce reserves to the smallest levels consistent with the efficient implementation of policy.

the normalization discussion and this use of overnight RRPs that makes me have noted, is the substantially larger footprint we could have outside of Tarullo's views and counsel in this One aspect of uncomfortable, as others the banking system, and I would align myself with Governor

June 17-18, 2014

money market funds seem a natural boundary today, I could see over size of our should remain a central tenet of our normalization strategy. regard.  Transacting directly with nonbank counterparties raises concerns about where we would draw the line, and while time that this pressure around fairness could grow and cause us to consider insurance companies, nonfinancial corporations, and pension funds as direct counterparties.  So, although as a practical matter the footprint may need to expand in the near term, I think steps to reduce the balance sheet in terms of the federal funds rate, returning the balance to its pre-crisis levels relative to GDP with a small amount of excess reserves calls, I think, maintaining a role for the federal funds rate throughout the normalization process.  At the To address the specific questions, sheet for same time, control of overnight rates will require, at least for a time, the use of an ON RRP facility.

funds rate is even though it may not serve as the primary tool during the early stages following to serve that purpose given the size of sheet and the use of IOER, but I would prefer to take an approach that maintains a in relation to the IOER rate. In terms of communications, I think continued reference to the federal appropriate liftoff.  As a practical matter, the ON RRP rate will need our balance wide spread as any kind of formal target of policy. I also support the development of an expanded federal funds rate, though I would prefer that we move cautiously before adopting it

sheet will naturally take us in this direction, and so, for that reason, I Regarding circuit breakers, I am comfortable with aggregate caps, with a market-based pricing mechanism designed to become activated when the cap is reached.  However, again, I think a smaller balance think we should remain focused on steps to reduce that balance sheet.

economy has not June when we reaffirmed the plan to cease midpoint of our SEPs projected improvement in the unemployment rate and increased inflation, I don't see a market expectations have shifted, we might consider maturing Treasury and MBS securities into shorter-dated Treasury securities.  That also provide for a more And, finally, regarding reinvestment policy, it seems to me that the disappointed relative to our expectations last reinvestments prior to liftoff.  If you remember, last June, the headline PCE inflation to be 1 percent in 2013 and the unemployment rate to be 7Â¼ percent.  Of course, unemployment fell more quickly, and inflation was above these projections, and given subsequent compelling reason to deviate from the plan of ceasing reinvestments prior to liftoff.  However, given that the primary dealer survey shows redirecting would allow us to maintain an elevated level of the balance sheet, but rapid runoff after liftoff.

YELLEN.  Could I just ask a question?  Did you say that last June we had CHAIR reiterated something about ceasing reinvestments?

MS. GEORGE.  We affirmed the broad principles around our 2011-

YELLEN.  But not the specifics around that.  We said-

CHAIR

right.  The tactics-in the press conference, it was clear that they suspended. MR. POTTER.  That's were sort of saw as being the broad outlines of the principles that we had laid out in MS. GEORGE.

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  The Chairman, though, explicitly said something about agency MBS being-

June 17-18, 2014

YELLEN.  I believe the Chairman said we would not sell MBS, and I think he CHAIR said eventually we would have a smaller balance sheet, but that other aspects of it were up for reconsideration.

Right.  If I remember correctly, Chairman Bernanke was the sense of the Committee was not to sell the agency MBS. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. very explicit that

MR. LACKER.  He didn't disavow anything else in that statement.

You're correct. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

[Simultaneous conversation]

YELLEN.  He didn't avow it.  He said we need to reconsider many aspects of the CHAIR exit principles.  They were essentially no longer-

DUDLEY.  The way market participants read it is that these VICE CHAIRMAN principles were sort of in suspension.

Of course, as the Chair noted, I have attended quite a few during my career, but up to now that were any doubt, preparing for this meeting underscored the fact that while the physical distance

So I'm looking forward to contributing what I can to the discussions you in my new role.

time and task to find the common ground in the discussion at meeting, but you did it.  And I found the memos helped both me and my staff focus To that end, I want to add my thanks to the staff for the very helpful memos this last time on normalization.  It was a heroic the previous on the open issues.

communications we make about normalization are going to be nearly as important, if not important, as the economics behind the choices.  In many cases, there is going to be a to explain to the public, which mitigates the benefits of more complicated methods. Now, in thinking through the issues, it became clear to me that the surrounding the choices equally tradeoff.  The more complex methods of conducting policy might afford tighter control of interest rates, but they are going to be considerably more difficult in my view have testing is, by necessity, small and in an environment rates.  There are going to be surprises along the way.  I able to raise interest rates with our tools, but precisely how much much we want to achieve as we begin raising think we need to be guided by experience as we It also seems clear that there is going to have to be learning by doing.  Although we been testing our tools, which is prudent, the in which we haven't been raising interest am confident we will be control of interest rates our tools provide, or how rates, is unknowable until we are doing it.  So I implement the transition back to more-normal policymaking.

to start with simpler methods, and then, as These considerations make me think it's better we gain more experience and we find those methods aren't working quite the way we'd like, we

As a contingency, I think we need to be prepared to use the full our tools, is that we communicate the stance of it, rather than Communicating in terms of market rates rather than administered rates that it's the effect of monetary policy on market interest rates and the transmission IOER rate target, since set the IOER rate, this doesn't solve the problem of what IOER target will produce the effect Turning to the questions, on question 1, my preference of policy in terms of a range for the federal funds rate, or an expanded measure by administered rates. makes clear of those to the economy that's important.  While we can trivially hit an we on the economy that we are seeking.

range is that it will transition from the period of normalization into a longer-run framework terms of a fed funds rate target or similar market rate.  Such a is my preference at this point.  That said, I realize there are measurement challenges funds rate as currently formulated.  With little trading in the market, the rate can and could be decoupled from other market rates.  So I'm open to thinking about into account a broader set of trades like Eurodollar to explain earlier rather than later, along the suggested We certainly need to do it before liftoff to avoid the appearance that we just because we failed to hit it, which would undermine our credibility. Another reason I favor communication based on a target funds rate provide continuity as we in which policy is formulated in framework with the federal be idiosyncratic an expanded version that would take transactions.  But if we go in that direction, I think it's going to be important for us carefully why we are doing it, and to explain this time frame in the memo. are redefining the target rate target at this point and communicating that we I prefer setting a range for the funds will be using IOER and ON RRP as the tools to support achieving that target range.  We can add term deposits or asset sales if we find we need more control over market rates.  I note that we are

June 17-18, 2014

range rather than a point target.  The public has target would seem to be swamped by the we consistently missed the point target, and by the might be needed to hit the point target.  So I don't see any at this point of moving back from a range to a point target, especially at the early stage is reduced to a size that gives us more control over the rate. currently formulating policy using a target accepted it.  And the economic benefit of hitting a point potential credibility issues posed if complexity or size of operations that advantage of normalization.  We can always narrow the range as normalization proceeds and the balance sheet the Even aside from the financial-stability concerns during times of financial full-allotment facility would decrease the potential for a revival of run.  And I think it will be very difficult to turn back once we limit the size of and avoid committing at this point to a permanent ON RRP facility. On question 2, regarding the overnight RRP program, I do have some concerns about full-allotment facility. stress, during normal times a the funds market over the longer go to a large-scale facility.  In addition, such a facility implies a sizable expansion of implementation of policy through nonbank counterparties, including money market mutual funds, whose accounting rules we have criticized.  So my preference would be to the program

would be binding more often than not, limits during normal times, market participants may might make contingency plans for binding caps and rely less I would also favor imposing aggregate caps that even in normal times, but particularly as we start the normalization process.  Such a binding limit on the size during normal times could have an additional benefit during times of financial stress-namely, having seen binding size view any circuit breakers we choose to impose to limit inflows during times of financial stress as being more credible.  And then they on the RRPs.

estimated effects, it probably doesn't make that much difference are simply stopped or gradually reduced once a decision is rate increase, the exit-strategy principles of Committee would likely first stop buying assets, then stop reinvesting, rates.  And I guess there is a certain salience to that given that the is related to the degree of accommodation.  But that timing presents a interest rates as our main policy tool, I would prefer to end reinvestments either at the in short-term interest rates or, if the other participants preferred, after increase. On question 3, given the economically whether reinvestments announced.  Regarding timing relative to the first June 2011 indicated the and then begin raising interest size of the balance sheet communications challenge.  I think it would be hard to announce an end to reinvestments without bringing forward market expectations of liftoff.  The cessation of reinvestments would essentially be the first tightening move, if it came before liftoff.  And since my preference would be to use time of the first increase the first rate it, it's going to be important to explain why we are doing it well before liftoff.  Coming into the meeting, I didn't have strong feelings about to publish two rates, but I found Governor Dudley's discussion persuasive that it may be better just to publish would prefer that we base the expanded rate on the FR-2420 data when those data On question 4, as I indicated earlier, I'm open to thinking about an expanded version of the funds rate.  But if we do redefine and to do it whether to rename the expanded rate the funds rate or Powell's and Vice Chairman one rate.  I become available to avoid the perception that we are targeting borrowing costs associated with foreign entities or money market mutual funds.

Thank you, To help, I think we might consider asking the staff to issue a some of the normalization considerations.  This could be similar Board staff issued early last year about income.

Of course, such a working paper would not replace any official communications by the Committee and the Chair, but it there are different approaches and several normalization, and that Madam Chair.

rich discussion at our previous meeting and digesting a rich array of on excess reserves and the MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  First, a couple of general remarks.  After listening carefully to the memos for this meeting, I remain unconvinced that we are going to need an overnight RRP program to ensure market rates rise when we raise the interest rate funds rate target.

for the vast majority of the links in the make up the monetary policy transmission mechanism.  And isn't going to work to keep the RP rate aligned with and the staff hasn't really explained a to my knowledge. We rely on some obvious arbitrage relationships chain of economic relationships that I don't see any reason why arbitrage interbank rates like the IOER rate and the fed funds rate, theory about why that wouldn't happen, at least

June 17-18, 2014

use at a scale like what we've seen runs the risk of inducing money markets, a concern many have alluded to here.  I think flows facility are going to be potentially unpredictable both in normal times and in think we are close to understanding remains open.  The staff, particularly in New York, collateral financing side remains a mystery, and there collateral that might otherwise have are lending to us now is being financed or held. Moreover, I think routine significant restructuring of into the ON RRP times of stress, as Governor Tarullo has emphasized.  I don't them.  I'd point to one question that documented shifts in funding in the sense of cash lending that seemed to be a response to our program.  What is happening on the doesn't seem to have been much staff work into where the been financed by the money market funds that temporary it to 40 or 50 basis points. the upper end of the range of the target federal funds rate accordingly to either would just that on the table.  Now, we will learn in short order whether the obvious arbitrage or not.  If it is, we can keep the overnight RRP rate at a deep backstop of IOER rate.  And the concerns everyone has about an large program will be answered.  It will be a relatively small backstop, just in case Accordingly, I would prefer to use an overnight RRP facility only as a contingency program.  In my view, we should start raising rates the usual way.  We should raise the interest rate on excess reserves by 15 or 25 basis points-so, take We should raise 40 or 50 basis points.  We should leave the overnight RRP rate at 5 or maybe 10 basis pointsmaybe increase it 5 basis points.  And when we did that, we would say that we may increase the ON RRP rate at future meetings.  We'd leave ourselves open with that option.  We leave relationship is effective 50, maybe 75 basis points below the excessively it's necessary.

I don't think term, but this is the idea that we announce we are tightening conditions, market conditions don't tighten.  Well, I don't think D-Day is the right way to this first increase.  If we held it in suspense, made it a big surprise, and then attacked the way to do it.  [Laughter] could do something a little more modest.  We could just say we are making an We without saying, 'This is the big day, everybody.'  When I was a kid, we'd get the TV rocket up. the IOER rate.  For our be inconsequential.  I don't think one much one way or another.  The big risk is what I'd call Bill English used this and some approach financial markets with overwhelming force-I don't think that's Instead, we adjustment in preparation for a plan to raise interest rates and adjust financial conditions. could do it and we'd watch John Glenn lift off and everything-T would get to zero, and the rocket would light up, but it would just stay there for 5 or 10 seconds before it started moving up.  [Laughter]. I think we'll get the with a big than later.  Let's get our learning If we do this, I think we'll learn pretty quickly whether we need a big-scale program, a medium-scale program, or what.  And given everyone's discomfort around here program, I think we'd want to do the learning sooner rather done right at the beginning, and it's just going to take one move and we'll figure it out.  So that's just a general comment.

how we configuration toward which I think we are going to head-IOER and a that is anchored at the top by the IOER rate of, say, 25 basis pointsIOER and describing things in We can even describe it in terms of the discount rate, for that matter. Let me grind my way through the questions here.  On the question about communicate, given the target federal funds rate there is an equivalence between describing things in terms of terms of the funds rate.

June 17-18, 2014

funds in terms of the funds rate or some suitably let the IOER rate be set by the Board in a related action.  That But I think the logical thing, given the governance reality that the Committee controls the rate target, is that we continue to describe policy defined interest rate and formulation has worked very well for the discount rate, and I think we should continue doing that.

point versus a range, unless the range gets much smaller, I think range.  Later on, when reserves get smaller, we can shift to a point.  I'd be We started targeting the funds rate because of controversy surrounding the On the question about a we should stick with a against stating a target in terms of general money market rates.  And I'd just remind you of a bit of history: accountability of the System Open Market Account manager and disputes about whether they were faithfully executing the charge we had given them.

DUDLEY.  I trust the System Open Market Account manager. VICE CHAIRMAN [Laughter]

With all due respect-There's an important element of what are we to do, how do we know they're doing what we have asked them to do, and so on, so it is important to keep a specific range that we can monitor. MR. LACKER. asking them I think think circuit breakers on a fixed rate, fullcapable of addressing the financial-stability issues that context.  If investors want to flee a particular counterparty, or a money market funds.  They've got bank deposits.  And that is just in the or from one On the question about circuit breakers, I don't allotment overnight RRP program are some have raised in this particular class of counterparties, depriving them of the option of Federal Reserve Bank overnight RRP investments is hardly going to stop them.  They have short-term Treasury securities.  They have United States.  Indeed, most of the bank runs in 2008 were from one bank to another

June 17-18, 2014

is worth troubling counterparty to another in the same asset class.  So I just don't think this ourselves about.

think we should impose an explicit quantitative limit on the size of the only because of the finite size of our balance sheet.  I mean, if we go to full would raise questions, what do we do if we get everybody showing up, and  running In our earlier discussion, we had a really the cap and then having an auction that interest rates down-this would be a mechanism to reduce the rate of return on ON RRPs to discourage people from shifting into them.  The obvious question is, why don't we the assets they're in?  That's what we that's germane here. Now, on the other hand, I do think we should limit the size of the program, if we're going down that road, and so I program, if allotment, it an auction like that described under option 2? interesting exchange about interest rates.  Stopping out at drives in order just reduce interest rates if we don't want investors fleeing usually do in a crisis anyway.  So I'm not sure reinvestment, I'm in President George's camp of viewing elements we articulated in 2011 that have not been specifically refuted as standing We indicated that we'd begin normalization by ending raising interest rates.  I think the macroeconomic implications of start running off our portfolio several months before or several months after we start are likely to be negligible.  And I think that the staff's analysis supported the idea is not terribly consequential.  But I do think it would erode our credibility to fail to the margin we would always to renege on past statements.  I think, as a general principle, there ought to be On the question about of the exit strategy that as implicit commitments of ours. reinvestments and only later whether we raising rates that this follow through on the guidance we provided several years ago.  Forward guidance is really central to how we conduct policy these days.  I would think that at be reluctant

June 17-18, 2014

little to gain there. something at stake.  And to me, the macroeconomic difference doesn't seem to be worth it.  It just seems like there is came in having been left with the memo-I can't remember which one-that there were enough legal to establish a new rate, Dudley seemed persuasive about those issues, so I be persuaded that we go with a single new rate. On the question about an expanded federal funds rate, I impression by some staff differences between federal funds and Eurodollars to make it important but Governor Powell and Vice Chairman could easily

the time and energy they have devoted to this.  We a great deal of time on this as well. I have two final thoughts.  The staff has spent an enormous amount of time and effort on these memos, and I greatly appreciate all have spent

Not as much as they have. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

a sense in which the memos have been focused on a narrow The issues we're talking about-should the central bank offer moneylike liabilities the banking industry-this goes back a couple of centuries to the about the banking school and the currency school, 100 percent reserves, narrow banking, a broader debate here and a broader set of economic issues about how structured that we haven't really touched on. MR. LACKER.  First, there's perspective. to counterparties outside debates and the like, and there is central banks should be thought-I'm sure there are market participants who are operational mechanics of our exit.  But the closer I get to September, the Is it the rate of change of resource utilization, or Second-and this is my last dying to know about the more I think that the operational mechanics are not what most Americans want to know about our exit strategy.  I think they are interested in when it's going to happen.  I think they will believe us when we say it depends.  But I think they are going to want to know what it depends on-is it the level of resource utilization?

June 17-18, 2014

like?  How does inflation figure in?  Does inflation have to get consumption, or output, or the high first, or are we going to nip incipient pressures in the bud?

the time we are spending on the mechanics of our exit are detracting from I worry that useful work that we could and perhaps should be devoting to the macroeconomics of our exit. Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota. CHAIR

Chair.  I'd like to start by echoing your look forward to working with all of you and learning from you.  One thing I have England.  I'm tempted NBA basketball, but perhaps that it too far.  [Laughter] MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam welcome to Governor Fischer, Governor Brainard, and President Mester.  As you said, Madam Chair, I already learned is that the name 'Fisher' is surprisingly popular among central bankers.  Look at our Committee.  Look at the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of to say that 'Fisher' is to central banking as 'Williams' is to stretches is that the dual-mandate benefits of the facility are small.  In contrast, as some around the table have already alluded to, I think that there effects on the industrial organization of short-term funding markets.  It's to say that they might well be this decision is rightly seen as being is in the purview of the FOMC.  I'm not talking in a legal sense, but more in the sense of In my remarks I am going to have three themes.  The first is that we haven't seen much analysis concerning the dual-mandate benefits of the overnight RRP facility.  And my own assessment, in the absence of that analysis, likely to be are very likely to be big hard to predict what those effects will be, but I think it is safe large.  Those two considerations together give rise to a sense of uneasiness for me about this decision being taken by this Committee-whether or not one that appropriateness.

June 17-18, 2014

market interest rates and the interest rate being paid on excess Lacker emphasized in our previous meeting and mentioned again today, are going to serve to keep those gaps finite and well defined. Let me turn to my dual-mandate point first.  This will echo some of the remarks that President Lacker made last time.  In the absence of the overnight RRP facility, there will of course be gaps between short-term reserves.  As President the forces of arbitrage that a bank borrowing federal risk-free return of more than 7 percent if that spread IOER rate and the fed funds rate reached 40 basis points.  This is taking into account and the FDIC assessment fee.  It's worth emphasizing that the the arbitrage would be even more effective if the System were to imposed on bank leverage. Some admittedly simple calculations by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis staff support President Lacker's point.  Those calculations suggest funds and investing in reserves could earn a between the things like the bank leverage ratio calculations suggest that exempt bank reserves from the 4 percent floor

Using the overnight RRP facility actively could close this gap further.  But this is think.  How much would our standard measures of of deviations from our inflation and employment goals, rise if there were funding rates, as Governor Tarullo mentioned?  I will repeat this, that could be as large as 40, 50, or 60 basis points emerging the IOER rate and other short-term funding rates.  How would that magnitude of gaps I talked about a 40 basis point spread being consistent with a risk-free rate of return of 7 percent. really a question about the benefits, I quadratic loss, in terms a gap of 40, 50, or 60 basis points from the IOER rate and other short-term opposed to the gap of, say, 20 basis points that just to try to be as clear as I can be:  If we just used IOER and did not have the overnight RRP facility, I would anticipate gaps between affect the quadratic loss in terms of our macroeconomic objectives relative to a smaller gap of, say, 20 basis points?

June 17-18, 2014

on this point.  My own the increase in quadratic loss would be a particular target for some short-term rate.  Making monetary policy is about influencing the public's beliefs about the conditions over the next few years.  And I believe that we can just as the the target, or target range, for a market short-term interest opposed to changes in multiple administered rates.  And this belief is supported experience of other central banks that use different operating procedures. As far as I know, we haven't seen any specific staff work assessment, in the absence of that work, is that de minimis.  And this again goes back to a point that President Lacker made at our previous meeting.  Making monetary policy is not about hitting interest evolution of financial effectively communicate this information through changes in a single administered rate like IOER rate as opposed to changes in rate-or as through the on the benefit side.  What about on the cost side?  I think it's very hard for us to will be a lot of demands on the think the fairness criterion that the really hard for us to predict modeling and analysis available answer to this question is going to be So that is know the ultimate effect of this facility on the industrial organization of short-term funding markets.  And we can say we'll start small, but I think there outside from other counterparties that want to have access.  I Desk has suggested using is going to force us to expand this.  It's how the structure of money market funds will change and what that change will mean for the funding of other financial institutions.  We could use the best between now and September, but I think even with that, the highly uncertain.

comment, then, along these lines concerns the role of the Congress and the input from the public.  And I think that form of So we've got limited dual-mandate benefits, and then big-time effects on financial markets.  My last public in making decisions about this facility.  The way we operate is, we deliberate in secret without much in the way of direct oversight or

June 17-18, 2014

course of monetary policy.  Should we be using that same closed-door to reshape the structure of the financial industry in possibly very fundamental waysthe absence of being able to point to very convincing and compelling dual-mandate decisionmaking is well designed and appropriately designed to prevent political considerations from influencing the process especially in benefits?

the power to pay interest on reserves to depository after deliberating for at least three years-probably those of you who know the than that, but I'll say for at least three years.  Should the in whether we can essentially pay interest on reserves to other financial it would seem to me that representatives of the public should be able to effect of this potentially far-reaching decision. The Congress originally granted us institutions history can say it was much longer Congress not have a say entities?  At a minimum, provide public input on the potential my general comments.  I see the dual-mandate benefits of this facility as more detailed analysis, and I see these costs on the industry structure the purview of our usual kinds of decisionmaking in So those are small in the absence of a side as being such that it is sort of outside this closed-door forum.

of the questions.  I thought that Governor Fischer's line of it's 1999.'  [Laughter]  That's a quote from tracking the Ninth District closely.  You know, we were all in 1999.  But that doesn't mean we have to monetary policy that way. Let me turn to a couple comments about the fed funds rate were very apt.  And to quote a Ninth District resident, 'There is no need to go back to making monetary policy like Prince, for those of you who are not much younger in 1999.  Everything was a lot better make can communicate effectively about the evolution of conditions through a single administered rate, the rate of interest on excess reserves. To get serious about this, I think we financial

June 17-18, 2014

monitoring interest rates were too relative to what we're trying to achieve, we could raise the rate of interest just extending his thinking to short-term interest rates. Governor Tarullo raised a great way of thinking about this.  I think we should just be short-term interest rates.  They are just one more indicator among a host of other indicators we can keep track of and we can be responsive to.  If we thought short-term low, for some reason, on excess reserves.  Actually, Governor Stein raised this way of thinking about things with respect to long-term interest rates.  This is on has to do with reinvestment.  I thought there was exit-strategy principles.  If you wanted a set of principles to enunciate in in that.  When it the likely sheet, I liked Governor Powell's language, which actually might also have thought it was a very nice fed funds rate gets to 1 percent. I think that we should have a deterministic path for the balance sheet, under which it to be thinking about a deterministic path for the balance sheet, and then IOER rate as our main policy tool. The other point I wanted to comment a great conversation about this.  I was drawn to Vice Chairman Dudley's language, which was more flexible, for the September, I thought Vice Chairman Dudley was right-we should be flexible actually comes to the time of trying to communicate something more specific about path of the balance been Vice Chairman Dudley's at some other point.  But in any event, I idea that the change in our reinvestments will begin when the After that, evolves slowly over time.  So that would mean smoothing out paydowns due to reinvestments and Treasury fluctuations.  We think of the balance sheet as exerting force in terms of our policy, so it makes sense for us using the

Governor Tarullo did, to making my future remarks short. Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have been relatively lengthy in my remarks, but I will not commit, as

CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you for that.  Governor Fischer.

June 17-18, 2014

you, because I was diet of papers, and it was very, very helpful.  I almost understand some MR. FISCHER.  Thanks very much, Madam Chair.  We all benefited from the excellent staff work and preparation of papers.  I benefited even more than most of force fed [laughter] this of the issues now.

of last time's discussion, and it was impressive, was very serious.  It was even interesting.  [Laughter]  And I thought it was at a high I thought the staff uncharacteristically made a mistake in this list of five possibilities, are three you know which one to go for.  This time you had to choose possibly be 1 or 5.  So we got to I'm not sure that it's a policy rate, but we'll come to that in a minute. I was required to read the transcript actually.  It level. because when there between three in the middle, options 2, 3, and 4.  It couldn't options 2 and 3, and options 2 and 3 barely differ.  In option 2, the policy rate is a market or administered rate.  I think it should say 'or rates.'  And in option 3, the federal funds rate is how you describe the policy.

corridor system in which the top of the corridor and the ON RRP rate was the bottom of the corridor.  But, a very complex one, because in most corridor systems the upper rate is the borrowing the central bank.  And here the down and down is up, and things like that, on most issues. Now, as I first heard about this, I thought what we had was a IOER rate was the if so, it's rate from the central bank and the lower rate is the deposit rate at upper rate is the deposit rate-  [Laughter]  This almost sounds like the difference between Britain and the United States-up is banks are not currently how I understand this issue.  And that really to an issue that bothers a lot of people, including me, and that issue-it was put too But the difference arises primarily from the fact that the U.S. active in the federal funds market.  At least that's brings us strongly as, is it our job to enable nonbanks to indirectly receive interest payments from the Fed? And while President Kocherlakota raised very valid issues, I think the answer is, it would be

June 17-18, 2014

happen and we didn't have to go to the Congress for a discussion on this want to, and we need to think about preferable if that didn't issue, which would probably end up with us getting a triple mandate or something else.  You don't go to the Congress lightly, in any case.  It does seem to me really problematic that we would be spreading seigniorage much more widely than we that.

just want to raise three issues.  First of all, how confident we can run this system smoothly and successfully?  Who was on the other side-this the reverse market funds?  Was it European banks, as I was Before I answer the questions, I are we that is a question for Simon and the people on the Desk-who was on the other side of repos all the time?  Was it American money originally told?  Who was it, and how robust is the behavior of this system?

been in favor of the IOER-only hope that the federal funds rate would I think that might happen when there are very few reserves in the If so, it with a lot of problems that some people have with using the federal funds rate. Second, a related question:  A lot of people have system-don't bother with the ON RRP program, and just trade close to the IOER rate. system, but it probably wouldn't happen right now.  But it would be interesting if we could have from the staff their view on whether there is any prospect of such a system succeeding. would deal third issue-and this is one that bothers me more generally, but it applies also in this that I am much less fond of trying to fix a deterministic path for what we are going three years down the road.  I don't think we know.  We can say what we think today to that they have suffered a huge loss in The context-is to do two or we are going to do two or three years down the road.  But if I look back at the 2011 exit-strategy principles, they are all about the federal funds rate.  Well, now we are considering whether make that the way we do monetary policy.  And if we watch what happened to the British with their forward guidance, which didn't hold up, I don't see

June 17-18, 2014

that the person who changed it wasn't to retain some flexibility, and I'll come to that in a moment. credibility as of now, but that may have to do with the fact the person who said it.  And it may be more complicated for us.  So I would prefer more the stance of policy primarily by targeting the federal funds rate or by that system seemed to work fairly well.  But it doesn't seem to be the IOER rate and, I think, Let me try to answer these questions.  The first one is, during normalization, do you want to communicate emphasizing administered rates?  Well, I would like to do it by targeting the federal funds rate. As Bill English said, something we could do right now.  We would have to go to at least the overnight reverse repo rate.

President Lockhart would like.  ON-blank-RRP is a for something.  I think if you wrote 'ONRRP,' without a blank, you would save committee, but may I By the way, I have a suggestion that very long name paper [laughter] and you'd save ink.  I'm not volunteering to join your propose that as a possibility?

that's one possibility-should it be a or a target range?  From what I understand now, if we made it a point target, we'd If we continue to target the federal funds rate-well, point target miss it significantly.  If we wouldn't, then I don't know why we're not doing it now and why we don't just go with that.  Everything I've read suggests we would have trouble hitting it, so I think a target range would be preferable.

overnight RRP and IOER rates, we the reason that the public knows about it.  It has of spreading the seigniorage around If we communicate the stance of policy using the should, I think, refer to the federal funds rate for the attraction that as we get to a much smaller size of the balance sheet, we could probably run this system operating via the banks, and we'd solve the issue too widely.

June 17-18, 2014

those to be so tough that you can't act as crisis.  And we're all thinking that everybody wants to pour their money everybody wanted to get their money out of here to think about keeping those caps flexible because they are do with our portfolio.  I think we need to retain that flexibility, and that movements, and we'd have to be ready to move interest In terms of the circuit breakers, you don't want lender of last resort in a into the United States.  It has happened that sometimes.  And we have really got caps on what we can would certainly involve interest rate rates.

Yes, because if we got close area in which we would be operating with no Should there be limits on the size of the overnight program? to the size of the portfolio, we'd be well into an knowledge of how the system would work, and we really need a constraint on allowing ourselves to get anywhere close to that point.

this the other day, I said, 'By the way, under which we would run off the size of the portfolio before raising of the portfolio. On the reinvestment of principal, when I wrote what is the circumstance the short rate?'  Having listened to the discussion, I think we shouldn't, and that we should raise the rate first and then start thinking about the size think we need to retain flexibility, composition of the portfolio and on the timing of beginning to run it off.  And on the already mentioned the real estate problem.  Real estate is much weaker is going to straighten out.  If it doesn't I don't know that we should try to fix a date for that.  I both on the composition, somebody now than we thought it would be, and I expect it straighten out, I don't think we want to be selling off MBS at the time that we have decided we should be beginning to reduce the size of the portfolio.

Fed constructs this index of the federal funds rate and the case in which we're targeting a rate A final thought-if the Eurodollar rate, then we have really got ourselves into a

June 17-18, 2014

a heck of a lot of influence over, and we're relying on the market keeping like it has been tight for quite a while, but it doesn't feel to me, given all the things that which we don't have them together.  Sometimes those arbitrages work, and then sometimes some strange thing happens and they break.  So I think we should say we target a measure like that, but I would prefer to actually publish the federal funds rate.  I think the Eurodollar rate is pretty far from us. It looks influence Eurodollars, that we can rely on that.  Thanks, Madam Chair.

And let me turn the floor over to further narrowing the range of possibilities here, and we will try to come back to you with something that we think principles that we can discuss at our meeting has now concluded, so we're in an FOMC Jeremy Rudd for the presentation on the economic situation.

Not to diminish the excitement of this moment, but, as presented in the almost completely unchanged from the April Tealbook.  After a relatively robust performance in the second half of last year, GDP growth turned sharply south, barely surpassing 2 percent in the first quarter.  As panel 2 shows, this decline was concentrated in the emerging market economies (EMEs).

In Mexico (line 5 of the table), any nascent benefits of the government's well-intentioned long-term structural reforms have been overshadowed by near-term tax hikes and a collapse in construction.

In contrast to the United States, total foreign potential growth (the black line in panel crisis years, ahead.  Interestingly, this shift up in growth occurs despite the fact that, over the next decade, potential growth in the AFEs (the blue line in panel 5) remains below its precrisis pace and EME potential growth is expected to steadily decline.

The top panel shows pickup in of 2016, that most of you view as broadly in line with your individual judgments two panels show Exhibit 1 shows the broad trajectories of your forecasts for key economic variables under the a modest slowdown in real GDP growth this year followed by a notable 2015.  Subsequently, in 2016, real GDP growth begins to move back toward its longer-run rate.  Your projections for the unemployment rate, shown in the second panel, decline gradually over the forecast period and, by the fourth quarter reach levels of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.  The bottom inflation gradually rising over the next few years, although almost all of you see it remaining at or below the Committee's 2 percent objective throughout the period.

As shown in the second panel, nearly all of you made a downward revision to your projected path for the unemployment rate this year and next, noting the greater-than-expected decline in months.  Moving to the bottom two panels, a number of you marked up a bit your total PCE inflation forecasts for 2014, but the central tendencies over the projection period are similar to those in March.  The Tealbook forecast for economic growth is slightly above the upper end of your central tendencies for 2014 and 2016, but at or slightly below the lower The Tealbook projections for the unemployment rate slightly below the lower period.

As shown in the top panel, most of you continue to think that panel of the target federal funds rate at the end of each year longer run.  Although your expectations about the year for the federal funds rate to leave the effective lower bound are little changed, a few of you marked up your target funds rates over the projection period, while marked them down:  The median funds rate projection now stands at 2015 and 2.50 percent in 2016, compared with 1 percent and 2.25 percent, respectively, in your March projections.  The mean projections also rose, albeit by less, from 1.11 percent to 1.18 percent in 2015 and from 2.42 percent to 2.53 percent in 2016.  The distribution of projections for the funds rate out a bit, with the range the appropriate level of the federal funds at the end of 2016 will still be at least 100 basis points below your assessment of at time was associated with an assessment that inflation would remain well below at the end of 2016.

A couple of you also mentioned measures of than the unemployment rate.  Compared with March, six projections now show lower values for the longer-run federal funds rate, with a lower potential growth rate cited as the contributing factor for half of those revisions.  As a result, the median longerrun rate shifted down to 3.75 percent from 4 percent in March.

They're estimated on got your estimates of underlying inflation.  In her shows, I think, some of You've got the StockWatson unobserved components-stochastic volatili ty model, the CogleySargent model, and this timevarying parameter-stochastic volatility VAR.  In figure 4, it's pretty clear that those estimates jump off data through the fourth quarter of 2013, and they take off from there.  Some are just straight lines from there, and some gradually go up a little.

just as a matter of arithmetic, if this unobserved trend, the last data observation is It's at least as important as any other, and, in most cases, it's more an intuitive reason why the most recent inflation for the second is higher.  I think that in the Tealbook, it was 1.8 percent.  But did you say Now, that's the natural property of these things because, you're forecasting the future and you've got the most important one. important than any other single observation.  So there's data are more informative.  But I noticed that your forecast for core quarter of this year that you're now thinking 1.9 percent, having seen the CPI data?

MR. RUDD.  For Q2 or Q3?  For Q2, it's 1.9 percent for core PCE.

But if that forecast for Q2 comes true and you rethey jump off from Q2's core inflation be higher than the MR. LACKER.  All right-1.9 percent for Q2.  Now, I realize that your inflation statistical trend estimation estimated those trends using data through Q2, wouldn't rate of 1.9 percent?  They might trend down a little, but wouldn't they all estimates that you show in Deb Lindner's memo?

end of your sample, you worry that those observations are influence by the last observation.  So in some sense, I think what you're alluding to is that when you've got one-sided estimates at the more influential.

in most of these cases, the trends probably wouldn't change all that much, and that the inflation forecast will still converge to some of these trends from a converging up to the trends.  It's not that the trend has been pulled down that  we're converging up to these trends from a lower level.  And if we a higher level, we'd probably converge from a little bit higher.  In particular, the expectations were anchored-over the past I think that what will happen is different jumping-off point.  You can see it in the sense that, in Deb's figure 4, we're below the trends and we're unduly.  Rather, it's started from timevarying parameterstochastic-volatility VAR is going to be least susceptible.  That trend looks extremely flat over the period that we think 15 or so years.

in figure 4? MR. LACKER.  Is that

not, because it's hard to do forecasts off of that model.  It's a model to run.  So for a whole host of reasons, we didn't do it.  But the trend memo, are different from MR. RUDD.  No, that's complicated estimates in panel 5 of the briefing, which was actually taken from the the forecasts that are shown in figure 4.

Well, let me just make sure I understand.  These statistical models, MR. LACKER. holding aside the Phillips curve models, would all go up, right?

MR. RUDD.  Models 3 through 5, say, in the panel.

MR. LACKER.  If you re-estimated them through Q2, all of the estimates would go up.

MR. RUDD.  Well, the trend estimates may or may not change very much.

I didn't ask how much.  I asked whether they'd go up.  None of them MR. LACKER. would go down.  They'd all go up, right?

parameter-stochastic might not change model but with a very the Cogley-Sargent model, I that model allows for possibly sluggish deviations from its trend, and it a relatively transitory movement away from the trend.  The going to react the least. MR. RUDD.  The timevarying -volatility VAR much at all.  The Stock-Watson model is very close to an accelerationist long lag right now, so that might actually pick up a tiny bit.  For don't know, because could interpret a surprise as being trend itself might be better anchored than in, say, the Stock-Watson model.  So I think, in order of precedence, Stock-Watson is going to react the most, and the time-varying parameter/stochastic-volatility VAR is probably a random walk.  The is right where it is now. MR. LACKER.  The Stock-Watson model's trend looks like forecast

walk. MR. RUDD.  The forecast is basically a random

MR. LACKER.  Right.  So it would go up the whole way, right?  It would go up to 1.9 percent or close to it.

June 17-18, 2014

reverse a lot of shock in the next quarter and then keep going at the trend.  The idea is that the very long moving average.  The current data will only have a tiny influence. MR. RUDD.  No, if the trend doesn't change, what will happen is, it will the current Stock-Watson model sees most shocks nowadays to inflation as basically transitory shocks that are reversed very quickly, and so it would probably pass through some of that and reverse some of the shock pretty quickly.  The trend itself is not necessarily going to move very much.  That's more like a underlying it was based on this stuff, and I'm wondering-you were sort that aren't a part of the analysis in Deb's memo, incorporates that or not. MR. LACKER.  No, I understand.  I understand.  So the question is your inflation in the memo sounded like of silent on whether your forecast for second-quarter inflation, which takes on board some highfrequency observations If Q2 comes true, will you revise up your underlying inflation forecast?

we think that, ultimately, what drives that object is longer-run inflation expectations have think that changes in underlying inflation as we've defined it are basically driven by in longer-term inflation expectations.  And those, we think, are still pretty anchored.  So would probably keep our 1Â¾ percent assumption and then see what the MR. RUDD.  Probably not, because inflation expectations, and we don't have evidence that moved.  We changes in our staff forecast, we dynamics of the model implied for our response to the Q2 data.

MR. LACKER.  Thank you.

rather obvious observation that, relative to the to the upper end of the envelope of those estimates.  So I think if those estimates moved up, MR. WILCOX.  I would interject only the estimates that are provided by our suite of models, we put our judgmental assumption pretty close we wouldn't feel much compulsion to adjust up our judgmental assumption.

measures?  I'd prefer MR. BULLARD.  Yes, just to follow up on this, though, one thing about inflation expectations is, you're using survey measures.  Why not use TIPS-based five-year TIPS.  I think we can control inflation over a period of five years.

to the Committee in January about the staff's inflation framework, we talked about that you get of inflation from financial-marketthink Deb cites one in her note-also imply that inflation is not coming back. MR. RUDD.  In the memo, there was a discussion about that, and, in the previous memo that we sent that as well.  More broadly, some of the forecasts based measures-I

MR. BULLARD.  But they shift around more than-especially the Michigan survey, which has been misforecasting inflation for more than two decades.

problem we have with the financial-market-based measures is they don't extend through long samples.  So it's hard to build a model around attribute to inflation expectations.  When people to the Blue Chip or the SPF or some other measure of inflation expectations to tie down measures that they think is really and MR. RUDD.  I think the that, first of all, them.  And, second, weird things can happen in Treasury markets that make those estimates move in ways that we probably wouldn't actually back out inflation expectations from those measures, they often do so with reference things like the component of movements in the financial-market-based truly reflecting inflation expectations as opposed to other things.

Well, I'd prefer you switch.  The Michigan measure has been off for MR. BULLARD. decades.

have the memo in front of MR. BULLARD.  I didn't get that out of the memo.  I don't me.

the point estimate models.  The same is true for the SPF.  One of the points that Deb makes didn't see the oil price shock coming. MR. RUDD.  That's actually the adjustment that's being made to get that's backed out of the in the memo is that the SPF, to the extent that it did well over recent history-the last decade or so-it was lucky.  It was because, basically, they

Okay.  Here's TIPS from your memo-2.5 percent over the period up CPI came in at 2.1 percent.  TIPS to get to PCE. MR. BULLARD. to 2004:Q1.  Actual headline CPI was 2.5 percent.  In 2009:Q1, TIPS said 2.7 percent.  Actual headline was 2.6 percent.  So it was right on the button both times.  It did get it wrong for 2014:Q1, but that includes the period of the crisis.  Headline said 2.7 percent.  It's been superaccurate.  It's CPI based.  So you'd have to adjust picture before-is the huge fraction of the forecast really practically the entire picture here. and we've got underlying or above-trend inflation, the Committee's official target? I have another question on this.  On the decomposition of core PCE inflation, what always gets me-and we've talked about this that's coming from this underlying inflation measure is So how should I interpret that?  If inflation comes in at 1.9 percent inflation at 1.75 percent, then should I say that we've got above-normal or am I supposed to compare it with 2 percent, which is

this is a relatively well-anchored level influences like slack or supply shocks canMR. RUDD.  In our judgment, you should be comparing it with 1.75 percent.  We think 1Â¾ percent is the underlying rate of inflation, and that around which other to be, 1.75 percent MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  So 2 percent is above.  I'm interpreting this is the new 2 percent.

serious about 2 percent. MR. RUDD.  Well, as we pointed out in the Tealbook extension, if you want to get to 2 percent, you'll have to do something.  Right now, we think that if you want to get inflation to 2 percent, you're going to have to push the unemployment rate below the natural rate for an extended period and prove to people that you're the credibility of the Committee is eroding, MR. BULLARD.  Well, are you saying that and that, therefore, the world now expects only 1Â¾ percent from the Committee?

ever expected 2 percent.  It's not clear they really even MR. RUDD.  It's not clear they know what the PCE is, for one thing.  [Laughter]

MR. BULLARD.  I suppose a lot of things aren't clear, but you do have inflation expectations here and, for instance, the SPF is right at 2 percent.

the next 10 years.  If you back about the next 5 years-it's above 2 percent, and it has been ever since the 10-year been 2 percent.  It's never been 2 percent for 5 years, 5 years forward, which to me that you have to be a little careful about interpreting even the SPF's 2 percent. MR. RUDD.  Well, but the SPF is saying 2 percent over out what the SPF is saying for the 5-year-forward period-in other words, 5 years down the line, what it says average has suggests

Okay.  But I'd be willing to interpret that over a 5-year period.  I think MR. BULLARD. we can control inflation over a 5-year period.  If the market doesn't expect 2 percent, then maybe we're not doing our job.

June 17-18, 2014

that it could perfectly well be the case that inflation expectations are the statement that's being made. MR. WILCOX.  Indeed, I think that's a version of what we're saying:  The proposition underlying this memo is anchored.  It doesn't need to be the case that they're anchored at 2 percent.  And, as best we can tell, the burden of evidence leans slightly toward inflation expectations being anchored at a modestly lower rate of inflation.  That's

FISCHER.  David, where were inflation expectations before 2008? MR.

have basically been pretty stable since the late 1990s. Michigan apotheosis of the run-up in oil prices and other commodity prices right maybe long-run expectations were starting to that these are longer-term expectations.  Short-term from the Michigan survey go all over the place. MR. RUDD.  Inflation expectations There's only one small hint that things were coming a bit unglued around 2008 in the survey, when, at the before the crash, there was a hint of evidence that react slightly.  I should point out expectations

MR. FISCHER.  When there was the economic collapse, nothing happened to expected inflation at the beginning of 2009?

MR. WILCOX.  Not to speak of.

that led us to concludevery grudging convert to this view-that inflation expectations were extremely well recessions we'd swings in commodity prices and a big increase in unemployment that we budge.  There's almost no measures that we look at. MR. RUDD.  That's the remarkable thing.  One of the things and I was a anchored was that, in the face of the 2007 to 2009 recession-one of the deepest ever seen, with massive think was cyclical-longer-term inflation expectations didn't movement in the survey don't change.  If you look at MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  Again, the survey-based measures the TIPS-based measures, they were very tight before the crisis-2-year; 5-year; 5-year, 5-year

very tight around 2 percent or maybe even a little higher. really gone away completely.  So I would say the character of inflation expectations was pretty stable. forward; and 10-year.  They're all They blew out during the crisis.  People didn't know what to think.  They did come back together after the crisis, but there was a lot of variance-a lot more than there was before the crisis-and that's never was damaged somewhat during the crisis, although, generally speaking, it to worry about things that happened in financial markets in that MR. RUDD.  I'd have period, too, though.

crisis itself, but then you're talking about years afterward whenMR. BULLARD.  Only during the period of the a couple of leading to flight-to-safety flows and were affecting Treasury markets in ways that, again, make me worried about using MR. RUDD.  Well, we had the European crisis things that these TIPS-based measures.

MR. BULLARD.  These are normal shocks- that we did. MR. POTTER.  The inflation compensation measures have been remarkably stable for the past year or so.  The last time they moved a lot was probably September 2012, in reaction to things

definitely not arguing about that.  As David said, we still think they anchored to?  That's where it gets a lot harder for us to back out MR. RUDD.  And we're inflation expectations are anchored.  That's a fundamental cornerstone of our forecast.  The question is, what are something specific.

a fundamental issue, because what you're really saying is inflation to 2 percent, you've got to shift longer-term expectations somehow.  And I MR. BULLARD.  I think it's that, to get

June 17-18, 2014

I've heard, anyway, have terms since September 2012, when we undertook QE3. don't think the Committee is even thinking about that.  The discussions not really talked in those there's a real issue here, but, to have recourse to in the back of the Tealbook volume, which shows survey-based to 10-year-ahead inflation just been remarkably flat, I would say, since the late 1990s. MR. WILCOX.  I'm not convinced that facts, I direct you to page 26 in the data sheets both inflation compensation from TIPS, down in the lower panel, and the measures, in the upper-left panel.  What is shown there is that the 5compensation measure has been running consistently above 2 percent.  That's for CPI.  And, consistent with Jeremy's description, the median 5- to 10-year Michigan survey, in the upper-left panel, has

itself has averaged closer to 2 percent than 1Â¾ I recall.  Is that your understanding of the PCE? MR. LACKER.  Madam Chair?  Inflation percent over the past 20 years, as inflation. MR. RUDD.  Headline

got all of these expectations measures, averaged 2 percent, anchored to 1Â¾ percent. MR. LACKER.  An average of 2 percent.  We've which you say indicate strong anchoring of inflation.  Actual inflation has and you think it's they're saying the underlying inflation rate is at some length in the memo is that, if you think curve, as were futures markets, and so they didn't really anticipate shocks that When we put these measures into our core inflation first two models in panel 5 of exhibit 4 are doing-they spit out levels MR. RUDD.  Well, for two reasons.  One is, when we put those measures into our models of core inflation, we don't find that 2 percent.  One of the things Deb talked about the SPF got it right, it looked as though the SPF was just wrong about the oil shocks.  They were behind the occurred that boosted actual inflation. models-that's what the of inflation-underlying inflation, as we've called it-that are lower than 2 percent.  In other

That's a 10-year-ahead forecast.  We're not really evaluating how well that did 10 years later.  We're some longish average period, what happened, but we haven't we've looked to evaluate how well the SPF did 10 years ahead.  What we did do is to back out what they're saying between years 5 and 10, and there you don't get 2 percent, which I interesting.

with 1.75 percent, and it's just been chance that this extra factor, right? MR. LACKER.  This thing about the oil shock last decade has always confused me. Let's say it's unexpected, the SPF is consistent we've gotten 2 percent instead of 1.75 percent-it's

MR. RUDD.  1.75 percent for core.

MR. LACKER.  Right.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Let's-

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY  Move on.  [Laughter]

YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota, did you have aCHAIR

Lindner memo, the staff has lowered its measure of underlying inflation from underlying inflation? MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I had a two-hander.  I'd like to ask a quick question.  As a result of the 1.9 percent to 1.75 percent.  I haven't been keeping track of where it was before it was 1.9 percent.  If I go back, say, two years, what was the staff's measure of

June 17-18, 2014

it looked as though average inflation over history, because of the new methodologies the MR. RUDD.  We changed it around the time of the last big revision of the NIPA statistics because BEA was using, was down one-tenth.  I can't remember the exact date though.

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes.  So it was at that time.  It went from 2 percent down to 1.9 percent.

the inflation memo forward to the MR. RUDD.  Then in January, I believe, when we sent FOMC, Mr. Wilcox briefed, and I remember there was a kerfuffle about 1.9 percent.

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Right.  Okay.  Thank you very much.

YELLEN.  President Williams, did you have a question? CHAIR

on the same subject.  [Laughter]  We've is a serious forecast now tells us that we have to create a substantial and sustained overshoot of 2 percent goal.  So it is consequential.  This is a bigger issue anchoring inflation, you've got to get that anchor back up.  We should think seriously about how we what it means for policy over the next few years. MR. WILLIAMS.  I did.  And, unbelievably, it's actually thought about and discussed this at length, so I really do want to just very briefly comment on this and not on the issues that have already been mentioned.  But this issue.  Your maximum employment to reach our than just one-tenth in a forecast.  When you say it's-let me just finish-in the actual of interpret this in terms of thought Deb's memo was really interesting.  I thought it was a great box on a I wasn't convinced at all by the analysis-the points have made.  Inflation over the past two years has been almost exactly 2.0 percent.  SPF is percent for the 10-year ahead.  And if you really get into thinking about what's a how you're starting from core and I actually contrarian risk to the forecast.  But already been exactly at 2 good measure of underlying inflation, why not look at the Dallas Fed trimmed mean?  That's 2 percent over the past 15 years.  So there's something about

June 17-18, 2014

long time, and I've done these inflation models myself, and I not the only way to think about this.  If you go from the top down, the FOMC has as our goal.  The fact that inflation ex food and energy runs under 2 reflection that, given the relative price movements over the past 15 years, you had to building up-I've been in the Fed a know this is committed to a 2 percent inflation objective.  It's not serendipity that we've gotten 2 percent. You could think of this percent is a have core be below 2 percent.

mean and some other measures of underlying different.  So I guess my challenge to you is to maybe bit from just building up core and then saying relative prices must be flat this analysis from a different perspective.  Again, I thought was good and interesting.  It's important, and I'm not quibbling over the facts in the consequential, and it's worthy of further discussion and analysis-but not Again, I look at the Dallas Fed trimmed inflation, and they're not nearly that distance yourself a little over the next 10 years.  Think about the analysis models.  But it is necessarily right now.  [Laughter]

WILCOX. We recognize that it's consequential.  We discussed all of those factors raise.  I would be the first to acknowledge that the confidence intervals encompass a of possibilities.  But, in the end, after having argued about this at great length the weight of the evidence was a little more in want to put up a harder to reflect that judgment on our part. MR. that you wide range ourselves as well, we came to the judgment that favor of a resting point for inflation that was a bit south of 2.  I wouldn't front than that, but I felt that we owed it to you

MR. WILLIAMS.  Well, the good news is, I finally heard Jeremy Rudd, after some 15 years, say that he has embraced the anchoring of inflation expectations.

at 2.  [Laughter] MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Just not

June 17-18, 2014

that we've taken, is the basic proposition.  Now, if the view that, through communication alone, you could get wage and price setters, who running the economy a little hotter for a period of my plausible for inflation expectations right now to be anchored at just a little different from what the Committee has in mind as its objective. MR. WILCOX.  President Williams, consider the following thought experiment.  As to the sanctity of 2 percent, if the Committee were, for whatever reason, to announce that your objective had been revised from 2 to 2Â½ percent, one could introspect about what the effects of that would be.  A consequence and implication, a corollary of the perspective that you might not get all of the way from, say, 2 to 2Â½ just on the basis of words alone, and that you might need to back that up with some actual behavior.  That's one takes are actual flesh-and-blood people engaged in the acts of setting wages and prices, to conform their behavior to your announcement without time, then you could take the view that 2 percent itself is a natural attractor.  That informs judgment that it's entirely something that's

YELLEN.  Okay.  We will probably continue to discuss this, I think it's fair to probably going to break around 6:00 for dinner, through a reasonable amount of this, it would be good.  President Rosengren. CHAIR say.  Why don't we begin our go-round?  We're so if we could get

My MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Even with the assumed strong second quarter, real GDP growth for the first half of this year has been quite disappointing. December submission expected growth for 2014 of 3.1 percent, and I now expect 2014 real GDP growth of only 2.1 percent.

While some of this can be attributed to temporary factors, from bad weather to unusual trade previously expected.  Several sectors of the economy explain For example, over the past six months, I have lowered my forecast for residential investment and

The scars from the recession appear earlier, investment than we would normally forecast as remain concerned about slack in the labor market.  I assume that some of the labor the unusually wide spread been the U-6 and U-3 measures of be less responsive than normal to the remainder of this recovery.  Specifically, I have in mind employment, more of the workers marginally attached to the labor force time for economic reasons will return to the labor market as full-time some of the decline from the previous employment report. I also market slack reflected in unemployment implies that the U-3 unemployment rate will the pickup in growth I anticipate for that, as we approach full and working part employees.  In fact, I was a bit surprised that the unemployment rate remained at 6.3 percent in May and did not reverse

Throughout the labor force participation rate because of the continued one-sided misses, but I will reason for this decline, particularly in the 25-to-34 age group, reflect the more recent developments in participation. is overstated as real GDP grows faster than potential. The labor force participation rate continues recession and the early recovery, even the more pessimistic projections for labor force participation have missed on the upside.  Like the staff, I have lowered my estimate of the steady-state need more evidence about the before I lower my steady-state estimate to My suspicion that some of the recent drop in the rate of labor force participation provides another reason why I do not expect to see the unemployment rate fall quite as quickly as we might otherwise have expected in early 2017.  Given the low Given my forecast of slower 2014 growth and a less responsive unemployment rate, I now expect to reach my estimate of full employment of 5Â¼ percent

I end my comments with a little trepidation about discussing the Deb Lindner model. One interpretation of her data analysis is that inflation expectations have because of unemployment systematically being above our target, and inflation being well below our target, since the Great Recession began.  Thus, contrary to the concerns of some about unanchored expectations on the upside, our systematic and persistent our 2 percent target are in danger of unanchoring expectations on the downside.  This occur at a time to take drastic actions to

This has implications for the Should the results will need to overshoot full employment in order to bring long-run expectations back to target and then to drive realized timing of our liftoff of short-term rates that we will be discussing tomorrow.

Anecdotal evidence and including the BOS, seem to indicate that inflation moving back to target, considerably faster than in the still trending upward at this point toward the Committee's information I've received from our business contacts, inflation is firming and no longer weakening.

In to decline, averaging 5.8 percent to get to the lowest number on the Committee, but I see Plosser tied me on this dimension. Accordingly, in my forecast, I have penciled in a over 3 percent for the current quarter, during the tandem with this outlook, I expect unemployment to continue by the fourth quarter of this year.  I tried that Charlie indicative of a clearly improving as on a long-term, demographically driven decline since 2000 that will likely the rate below 60 percent a decade from now.  I see it as unlikely that this secular decline interrupted in a lasting way in the medium term.  For this reason, I continue to forecast in the unemployment rate, and I continue to interpret those declines as consistent with the payroll jobs numbers, which have averaged better than 200,000 worked year to date in 2014 are up about last year at this time. I interpret the continuing declines in unemployment as labor market.  My reading of the literature on labor force participation leads me to view the participation rate leave will be relatively rapid declines indicating improvement in labor market conditions.  This interpretation of unemployment declines is per month since the Committee began the open-ended asset purchase program in September 2012, more than 18 months ago.  Similarly, hours 4 percent, almost double the year-to-date figure

My view on is that the U.S. labor market was likely badly damaged during the past five years and, to rise through 2014 and to exceed the inflation target of inflation are forecast to be by the end of 2015 on a year-over-year basis.  You heard it here first, as I told you among SEP participants in making this to generate baseline than monotonic convergence of inflation to the current levels, given the current level of the policy rate.  We have simply incorporated it into our Furthermore, I see an below the medium-term this issue furthermore, has well-known and lasting structural problems, suggesting that the natural level of unemployment is higher today than it has been in recent decades.  Accordingly, my forecast this round calls for inflation to continue 2 percent by the end of 2015.  Specifically, both core and headline 2.4 percent last time.  I believe that I am in a small minority forecast-possibly a minority of one.  But the empirical models we use forecasts consistently predict oscillatory rather inflation target from taken this empirical summary of historical experience at face value and near-term forecast of inflation with only modest judgmental adjustment.

My view is the ECB should be able to hit its inflation target of 2 percent over a period as long as five have at times advocated that Europe should be more open to undertaking a easing program similar to ours in an attempt to move inflation back toward target. Globally, I see continuing stabilization and modest growth in the euro area as helpful to U.S. macroeconomic performance.

However, I'm not sure this says anything about the causal effects of drinking sweet tea.  Weakness north of the sweet-tea line seems to reflect the Hampton Roads Carolinas, though, are seeing a pickup in loan growth and investment.  A banker in South Carolina, for example, says growth reflecting expansion-related investments.  In North Carolina, bankers said that credit quality is getting better and better.

The estimate of the long-run growth rate of real GDP has been lowered Â¼ percentage point, been reduced 3Â½ percentage points, and the forecast for this structures has been cut 3Â¼ percentage points.

There were times over the intermeeting period when I was tempted to make a pushed my GDP projection higher.  The in pretty strong for the fourth quarter.  It seemed on track for similar gains despite the weather.  But recent reports on health-care expenditures and retail sales paint a different picture, making the strength in fourth-quarter consumption growth look more temporary

than permanent.  So I don't see household spending picking up much momentum in the second half of this year.

that experience seems to have left a large segment of the as less a cyclical phenomenon than a fairly fundamental weight now on the financing opportunities and provides another good reason remains a substantial overhang of my sense is that the will be fairly persistent, and that a burst of residential that in the Tealbook, albeit delayed-is relatively unlikely. I'm also less optimistic than the Tealbook about the outlook for residential investment. Five years on from the recession, population much less inclined to make major housing investments than in previous expansions. Like President Plosser, I view this structural shift in the housing market.  People are bound to place greater possibility of large declines in home values and in their ability to repay.  On top of that, tightening credit availability reduces for caution in household financial planning.  In addition, there homes associated with foreclosures or seriously delinquent mortgages.  So sluggishness in single-family starts investment-like take so long for inflation to get to 2 percent.  President The other difference I'd highlight concerns inflation.  I really appreciated, as I said, the latest memo providing details of the staff's thinking on inflation forecasts, but I'm not completely convinced that it will Williams raised some excellent points about interpreting relative price changes and the approach of relying so heavily on core for underlying inflation trends.

the firmer inflation readings we've seen of late raise for me the serious likelihood that we're going to see toward our 2 percent target this year.  And, while the staff rightly argues than zero.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

Chair.  I'd like to spend my time the memo on inflation by Deb Lindner, which I MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes-thank you, Madam talking about two related topics.  The first is

June 17-18, 2014

excellent and was very informative.  The second topic is a couple of lessons from the intermeeting period. thought was Japan based on conversations that my policy adviser, Kei-Mu Yi, and I had with BOJ monetary policy committee members in the Lindner memo was important in two key respects.  The first has to do with 2 percent not intrinsically inconsistent longer-run goals statement.  That statement makes no reference to any kind of I thought how it feeds into the staff outlook for inflation.  The staff outlook, under their best estimate for the Committee's monetary policy reaction function, is now that inflation will return to sometime in the early part of the next decade.  Now, this forecast is with our current time horizons.  As a result, in principle, inflation could run persistently above or below 2 percent for 5, 10, or 20 years without violating our longer-run goals statement.

alluded to.  He expressed idea of exceeding maximum employment and having overutilization of If that's a think it's going to be very hard for us to say that longerdecided to make necessary to move inflation back up to say that we're going to hit 2 percent, because once inflation drifts down, a general I will make a remark on something that President Fisher discomfort with the resources in order to move up inflation expectations, if I'm interpreting correctly. general sentiment on the Committee, then I long-run inflation is under our control, as we do in our longer-run goals statement.  The run goals statement says that we have control over long-run inflation and we that 2 percent.  But if we're uncomfortable exceeding maximum employment in order to move up inflation expectations, as the staff indicated is 2 percent, then we can't we're not willing to move it back up.  That's something we should talk about if that's sentiment among Committee members.

of the Lindner memo is its implication for the behavior of inflation Okay, so the first thing is that the impact of the staff outlook is very important.  The second important aspect

hear, I took on board the estimates out of the econometrics models-the estimate of the trend component in the Cogley-Sargent and Stockthan 1Â½ percent.  What is this telling us?  This like econometricians, inflation on inflation and inflation expectations. expectations.  As you'll Cogley-Sargent and Stock-Watson models-more than I did the imputations from the SPF and Michigan surveys.  The Watson models of inflation is currently less means that if people in the economy form their expectations expectations would now be materially below target.  And this, I'm worrying, would, in and of itself, put further downward pressure guess, somewhat from the thinking of the staff is, don't see any evidence of that FOMC's with Governor Fischer they don't necessarily understand what inflation rate we're talking about, they trust us that inflation rate.  We continue to be credible in that the public trust our willingness and ability to deliver 2 percent inflation.  I don't think we happy situation continuing indefinitely.  The staff forecast does not The point on which I would differ, I when I look at survey evidence and financial market prices, I downward drift in inflation expectations at this time.  My interpretation is that, unlike the models that are learning only from the data, the public is listening to us talk-to the communications-and we continue to be credible.  Even though I agree that we're going to hit 2 percent on the continues to should just count on this have inflation returning to 2 percent for more than five years.  I think it's in the early part of the 2020s.

There's no way to know for sure, but I believe that they have on inflation.

Although inflation is still running below the Fed's 2 percent goal, there's been some over-year inflation rates Fed's median CPI and trimmed mean CPI-which, of course, I am very partial since the start of the year.

this is a one-time option, and I'm going to exercise it.  I project that be about 3 percent in the second half of this year and through 2016.  This is around 2Â½ percent.  I note I am somewhat more optimistic may prove to be right, but uncertainty around any estimate of trend growth is high. Now, I have the luxury of not having to compare my projections with my last projections. [Laughter]  I realize that growth will somewhat above trend, which I put about trend growth than the Tealbook, which has revised it down to 2 percent.

With inflation inflation firming, I project that inflation will gradually move target over the forecast horizon.

Consistent with the Committee's forward guidance, I project that, after liftoff, the fed funds rate will rule with inertia.

I'll spend the rest of this risk and the implications for policy.  Not surprisingly, much of this discussion is recent paper that [Laughter]

if we face this tradeoff-and I understand there are people in this room who convinced by this, but you think of this as a risk-it would be optimal to temporarily consistent with the FOMC longer-run policy goals To preview, are not overshoot on inflation by a modest amount.  Such an outcome balances our price-stability and maximum-employment mandates, completely and monetary strategy statement that we agreed to back in January 2012 and have since twice reaffirmed.

versus short-term unemployment on inflation.  My own reading of the research leads me to conclude that it's hard to dismiss outright the possibility that the effect on wage and price setting than the short-term the short-term unemployment gap is a far more no additional information. Various Committee participants have discussed the evidence regarding the influence of long-term unemployment data and long-term unemployed have less unemployed.  Estimating a standard expectations-augmented Phillips curve for the period from 1960 through 2013, Glenn and I found that important determinant of inflation than the long-term unemployment gap.  In fact, in our own model, after controlling for the short-term unemployment gap, the long-term unemployment gap provides this aggregate type of analysis is sensitive to consistent with research by Bob Gordon, by Mark Watson, and by Alan Krueger, Now, I recognize that some have argued that model and sample specification, and I have read those papers.  But I would mention that our findings are and they use different models and samples.

June 17-18, 2014

noted that micro studies using cross-state or cross-city variation find little and long-term unemployment in determining inflation.  I think those studies closely.  I will say that these studies are identification-basically macro effects and local effects. interesting to me that there is actually a very well-developed literature on this the British data.  It's a different country, but they do find results similar found in the United States-that the long-term unemployed have little influence on Others have differences in shortare very interesting, and I've been following that themselves not immune to some criticisms, especially around separating causation from correlation and distinguishing between In that regard, it is subject in the United Kingdom associated with Layard, Nickell, and Manning, which did do very careful econometrics on to those we price setting in the United Kingdom.

evidence right now is that there's evidence on either side, and it's far least be open to the possibility that inflation will move up faster than expected and be is a risk to the Tealbook baseline forecast I thought was worth investigating. The way I read this from dispositive.  With the short-term unemployment rate close to its historical average, we should at prepared to respond appropriately.  In other words, this that response to such an unexpected pickup in inflation depends, of course, nearing full employment.  The long-term unemployed are market and beyond our policy reach.  So the short-term good measure of maximum employment.  I want to say that long-term unemployment share in the United States is cyclical, suggesting that, as the share will return to its normal level. The appropriate on whether it also implies that we're essentially disengaged from the labor unemployment gap would also be a the evidence does not support this view.  First, our time-series analysis in our own paper shows that the economy improves, the

June 17-18, 2014

mentioned at previous meetings, the long-term unemployed are finding jobs, of reemployment has actually improved as the economy has gained strength.  This Second, as I and the rate implies that weak aggregate demand, rather than hysteresis or other structural factors, is behind today's elevated rate of long-term unemployment.

long-term unemployed look similar to the short-term unemployed across key recoveries.  So overall, this evidence indicates, in terms of employability, long-term unemployed are, in general, not that different from the short-term than in the duration of their joblessness.  As a consequence, the total maximum employment in our mandate. Finally, the characteristics such as educational attainment, occupation, and industry, especially by comparison with past that the unemployed-other unemployment rate, rather than the short-term unemployment rate, to my mind, remains the right metric for thinking about the risk that the resource gap for determining near-term inflation that satisfies our full-employment mandate. So combined, the evidence on inflation dynamics and the employment prospects of the long-term unemployed raise could, in fact, be different than the one associated with maximum employment.  In other words, the limited impact of the long-term unemployed on inflation creates a wedge in the dual mandate-in particular, a divergence between the policy path that satisfies our inflation mandate and the one

using optimal policy in a simple forecasting model, We find that the influence of this wedge is just supply shock in any other model.  Appropriate policy calls for balancing the objectives of its target by a than in standard model that does not distinguish between short- and long-term unemployment.  So, In our paper, we actually studied this and we looked at the implications of this wedge. like a price stability and full employment by allowing inflation to temporarily overshoot modest amount.  With inflation rising more quickly, optimal policy is somewhat tighter the

June 17-18, 2014

a supply shock, and you policy just responding to that as the inflation data confirm that that's what's going from the point of view of the policy implications, it's very much like can think of on.  Thank you.

The Tealbook estimate of annualized growth in the second half certainly seems doable, but I also wouldn't be we fell back into that 2 to 2Â½ percent range that we have averaged since the recovery important because it would be meaningful in driving the expected timing of liftoff.

But at the same time, I don't think we can ignore it altogether, as we many of these discouraged workers will return to the labor force as the labor run out of labor market somewhat sooner than we had thought earlier. I also view the sustained decline in the unemployment rate this decline tells you that in the participation don't know how market tightens.  So, at the margin, I think the likelihood has increased that we will excess slack in the

Earlier, I thought that credit availability the financial sector returned to health and housing prices bifurcation across FICO scores will turn out to be much is, I think, that the mortgage-lending decision fundamentally security of the loan rested primarily on the house as collateral.

Thus, the collateral of the house offered much lender than had been anticipated at the time the loan was made-hence, the weight on the creditworthiness of the borrower.  I don't think this is together with the and higher down payment requirements, this suggests that will be with us for a long time. This presumably made sense in a world in which housing prices typically rose, because that drove down the loan-to-value I think the crisis changed all of this.

few questions about the low level of volatility that currency, equity, and fixed-income markets.  This does cause me some concern participants will respond to this by taking on greater risk.  That would prove when volatility inevitably increases. Finally, I'd like to pose and answer a we have seen in that market problematic so low?  As I see it, there are two broad sets of to the consensus outlook, so existing the outlook hasn't changed in a material way. is quite narrow. The first question is, why is volatility factors.  First, the economy is evolving in a way close positioning doesn't need to be adjusted because And, second, I think there is remarkably little disagreement about the outlook; the dispersion of the forecast

question is, are we responsible for this low level of volatility?  Well, I think our to liftoff does help reduce uncertainty about the path of short-term we are partly responsible for this low volatility?  Well, I do think we should remind and that this low volatility will inevitably end at some point to behave in a way consistent with the risks that exist and how The second we are partially responsible.  Our gradual, predictable taper of our asset purchases and forward guidance with respect rates, and this contributes to less volatility.  That raises the question, should we do something about this if investors that the world is uncertain, in the future.  We want investors the world might unfold in the future.

think we want to deliberately create more uncertainty about monetary policy because low volatility also stock prices and lower term premiums that make financial conditions more As I see it, we're essentially words, we are generating lower But I don't just in order to make financial markets more volatile.  That is contributes to rising accommodative, and that is actually a goal of policy.  At the zero lower bound, keeping financial conditions accommodative is what we're trying to achieve. incurring some increased risk on financial stability-in other

In contrast, if we weren't at the zero lower bound, I would me is, at the zero lower bound, you may want to damp volatility to make financial conditions might be some payback for this later.  Thank you. For myself, I think the tradeoff taking, leverage hasn't increased much and credit sharp rise in volatility is feel differently.  Then, it wouldn't be such an attractive tradeoff.  We could have more volatility and less financial-stability risk, but we could offset that impact on financial conditions by lowering short-term interest rates.  In the current setup, this isn't available to us.  The bottom line for easier, even though there

If that's the case, it's not an act of God, or in a very complicated sense is it an act of God.  [Laughter]  And it means there is rest to the world, but on inventories, I'm not sure what it is.  I don't take much comfort would rather it was the weather, and then we'd know it's warm now, and we're not this quarter or next quarter. MR. FISCHER.  Thanks very much, Madam Chair.  I'd like to just say a few things about how the state of the economy looks or, rather, what questions I have about it.  We have got two basic facts since last time.  One is, we had an extremely weak weaker and it's not so much weather, it's at least only something happening in the economy that we really didn't quite understand; on exports, okay, that's the from that.  I going to have that labor market seems to be continuing to do well, and I think everyone here thought that there would be a backup from 6.3 percent to 6.4 percent or The other fact we had was the almost

June 17-18, 2014

expected growth because of lower in the pipeline of the production something like that.  It didn't happen.  And the staff had to decide how to deal with these facts. Well, they've gone with the strong labor market and downplayed what happened in the first quarter.  But at the same time we have had a major decline in potential growth.  That, I understand, was something that was function of the Division of Research and Statistics for some time, so it's not directly caused by the first quarter.

short term, not very different than We have some key questions now.  One is, how fast are we growing?  Well, the outcome we get is, in the long term, less than we thought, and in the what we were growing at, except for the statistical effect of having the first quarter be negative, and more and more negative so far, as time has gone by.

long term, and I'm going to wait before are not very easy to I think we don't know very much about the marking down long-term growth.  Well, I have read the papers by Bob Gordon, and I have listened to Joel Mokyr, and I read the newspaper yesterday, and I understand there's still an argument going on in the profession, both of them based on things that quantify.

mindful of the work by Reinhart and Rogoff and the fact that recessions the noise about their don't know that we have finished made up my mind about looking at a fairly long disturbance. I am accompanied by financial crises are longer and deeper.  Despite all empirical work, I think that fact is pretty well established.  I seeing the impact of that financial crisis on the growth rate, so I haven't whether we're heading for secular semistagnation or just going to may get a little bit out of state and local governments if the the forecast. The second question is, what will happen to fiscal policy?  Well, it is not become very expansionary, but we economy begins to expand more rapidly, as is

June 17-18, 2014

labor market approaching full employment?  Well, certainly faster than we expected.  And it's interesting, if you look at the behavior of both the turn and is also coming down, and that's part, presumably, of the ongoing market.  That means that productivity must be growing less fast than The third question is, how fast is the it's short-term and the long-term unemployed, they are both coming down.  Long-term unemployment took a equilibration of the labor we thought, except for the participation rate declining.

They are don't think they will be growing as slowly as this when we begin percent or a little more, and as the unemployment rate gets close to our estimates of supposed to be very flat, I don't think it will stay might be asked, on what empirical work this?  I haven't done that empirical work. The fourth question is, how fast are rising very slowly, but I growing at 3 full employment.  And if the Phillips curve is that flat when we get closer to full employment.  Now, I do you base

It depends on wage growth and various things, but here I want to go back to a question I raised yesterday.  We are putting a lot of at 2 percent.  It is our inflation rate that is not at 2 percent, that the public thinks we are achieving our goals, I'm not sure they know what the inflation rate as measured by the PCE deflator is.  And it's the CPI, which is probably the best estimate to them. And, fifth, what is the outlook for inflation? other weight on the inflation rate not being so we are not achieving our goals.  My guess is because my guess is, if there's anything they think about of what their cost of living looks like that we calculate in using Okun's else that we've got in the model, are really entirely relevant to how the the inflation rate, and I think the I don't think that the small changes in the inflation rate law, and everything public-and that means businesses as well as households-see

June 17-18, 2014

little less, but-and now I come to the second point-we have this it. outlook for inflation is a incredible uncertainty about these things, and we don't really know how to deal with

Dudley just talked very convincingly about how to think about low of, nonetheless, having high uncertainty about the future.  But I want to the real federal funds rate, the Tealbook emphasizes-this is uncertainty around these estimates.'  First, of funds rate, '70 percent confidence interval around our estimate of are possible, and so forth. Vice Chairman volatility in the context quote from the Tealbook.  Apropos on page 31 of Tealbook A-'the high degree of the long-run real federal 1Â¾ percent would run from negative Â¾ percent to 4Â¼ percent.'  I don't know how to think in that context of changes of Â¼ percent that will do in the years to come, the difference between a growth rate of 1 percent and a growth a rate of per capita growth of 1Â¼ we have changed to, is 20 percent.  That is not small.  If 1 percent or 1Â¼ percent.  That's a big change, and I also Now, trend output growth can be estimated more precisely with a standard error of just over Â½ percentage point.  But we should recognize, if I can quote Herb Stein, which I frequently rate of 2 percent is 100 percent.  And the difference between percent and 1 percent, which is what you think it's small, ask yourself what difference it makes over 50 years.  It makes a big difference whether we're growing at don't know what we should do about it.

remember in which context, has just given us an example of how to do it.  The other part is any ambiguity.  I don't believe that the rates of uncertainty reflected in the VIX or something like that, are in fact the amount of is around. We had a little bit of a discussion of this yesterday-I don't but we need to think about that.  Bill is very clear, and I don't think there uncertainty we have in the economy now are representative of the behavior of the economy, and the rates of uncertainty that

we ought to keep saying these estimates are uncertain because, if not, we will mentioned they wanted to give the impression that they knew I think that be accused of screwing up again.  We will end up like Mark Carney, who was yesterday for having changed the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee's forward guidance.  Well, he is only changing because for sure what was going to happen and when they were going to do it, and they didn't because the uncertainty is so large.

use uncertainty as an excuse for not achieving what we may want to say, 'These are our best estimates, but there is a lot of uncertainty out there We can't say 'We could say that and it either.  But I think we've got to figure out how to deal with it. I think we've got to not to achieve, but just in the world.  Many things can happen, and we will make responses to changes in underlying conditions, and you should expect that.  This is what we think will happen.' also know that with a probability of 99.5 percent it won't happen,' but we totally confuse the public.  This is something I am just throwing out because I don't know how to deal with

Thank you, Madam Chair.  A few quick points, some of which are connected.  First, I subscribe significantly increased momentum of probably at yesterday afternoon, it is probably worth noting that cap-ex almost has to jump some this year, because there have been And from over the past few minutes-I find it a little hard to totally ignore Q1.

And since weather is, at most, an is probably at least a little bit of reason for lingering concern as to recent bounceback.  I think that's connected to was saying. mean, subject to data revisions year wasn't incomplete explanation, as Governor Fischer just pointed out, particularly for the housing slowdown, I think there whether there is some weakness underlying the some of the things Bill there certainly continues to be improvement in the labor market.  Everybody cited still hard to say just how much less slack there is.  Some of the incoming data, I think, can read in ways that are consistent with both of the narratives we have been hearing over the recent uptick in job openings has been read by some mismatch problems now manifesting themselves, suggesting that there an indication that employers are finally moving steps to actually do more hiring.  What will Third, it.  By definition, that means there must be less slack than there was six months ago.  But I think it's still be past year or two or three-for example, the as an indication of latent is less slack.  But I think you could also read it as from talking about more hiring toward taking the ensue will be more hiring and perhaps increased employment of the long-term unemployed, whose rates of job-taking, as Stan just noted, have picked up some.

I didn't download it and read it last night, President reminded again that recession and recovery, short-term and long-term unemployment in the United States only observation we have to make judgments about the implications of long-term Similarly, I think the is going to continue coauthored by President Williams-I'm sorry-but I will.  As he was describing it yesterday, I was until this had essentially moved together for more than half a century.  In some sense, the current situation is really the

That both sides of this issue for a while we are just going to have to be pragmatic of a pickup in wage increases, though this trend continues and, at the levels that are able to continue to rely on wealth effects from the asset appreciation over the past year or so. Fourth, we have definitely seen some early signs not so much in total compensation.  I believe we should all hope that indeed, accelerates, since PCE increases are going to be hard to sustain anticipated in the Tealbook in the absence of significant increases in household income.

On the economic side, people have mentioned-Beth Anne did yesterday-the case of possible Chinese inability also begun to wonder some about Japan, which seems to be slipping from the relatively favorable trajectory that it established last year.  On the geopolitical front-this is all pretty has been some reduction in risk of broad-based fallout from couple of people noted yesterday, Iraq has returned to the fore as a source of potentially substantial instability with rising effects of the type we have already seen on oil markets and beyond.

To be specific, the risk in the near term, to me, is not that of a meltdown at the crisis, but rather After almost six years of continue core of the system, which is much stronger and better protected than before the that of a sharp correction amplified by the liquidity mismatch in the markets that would damage or halt the progress of what is still a weak economy.

Particularly important me would be, along with low realized volatility and the reach for yield, the guidance that this central banks have given, that rates will remain low for the foreseeable As we've discussed, and I would be in agreement generally with Bill's question, but as we discussed yesterday morning with the staff, implied volatility for currencies, and long- and short-term fixed income are at historically low levels around the globe and market participants for Committee and other future.  This explanation, to me, cuts across and supports all of the other explanations.

The reach for yield is also evident across fixed-income markets-for regarded as the canary in the coal mine.

It seems to me to be a task mainly for communication, on which a great deal rides.  I must say I found the statement by Governor Carney of the Bank of England last week interesting in this markets currently expect, and this unexpected statement seems to have been intended to produce a reaction, which it did.  Sterling rates and volatility moved up significantly.  After a short delay, U.S. rates and volatility also moved up in a more muted fashion as investors digested this speech, as the U.S. is seen as being only a few markets to the slightest hint of an actual even one that is thought likely to be at least a few months off.  It also shows one disconnect between market expectations and Committee intentions.

At our previous them to a few key questions that underpin our policy decisions, and with your indulgence I will employ the same approach today, relying, in fact, on questions that are close cousins posed last time.  The questions are the ones that purchases, namely, is the labor market continuing to improve and is progress likely to be sustainable; and second, objective over time?

market improvement, I heard broad agreement around the table the labor market is continuing to improve.  A number of you, including Presidents Fisher, labor market developments in your own regions, and of about 180,000 in March. On the question of labor that Plosser, and Bullard, mentioned positive course, the employment reports for April and May showed solid job gains nationally with the three-month averages of both total and private payroll gains now standing about 230,000 per month, which is up from mentioned a wide set of labor market indicators and indexes that you've constructed; the ones similar to the Board's labor market index U-5 and U-6 are down, job openings up, the rates of hiring prevalence of hard-tois rising.

I think the evidence does suggest that a disproportionate share of job loss during the middle-paying occupations, whereas the gains since then have been tilted Of course, along with the decline in the unemployment rate, we have also seen a significant decline in the labor force as cyclical. slack.  Several of you, including Vice Chairman Dudley, noted that you agree with this interpretation, but I did Presidents Plosser bounceback in participation.  Indeed, conceivably, the decline phenomenon that President Fisher mentioned yesterday, namely, the disappearance of class recession came in somewhat toward lower-paying occupations.

far we remain from our maximum employment goal, this is explicitly-see notably more slack than large share of the work reflects cyclical factors.  These forms of shadow On the topic of how something we will surely be debating in the coming months.  A number of you-including Presidents Rosengren and Lockhart, who mentioned this would be indicated by U-3 alone.  This reflects the fact that an unusually force is involuntarily underemployed, as well as the unusually large decline we've seen in labor force participation, a portion of which arguably underemployment or unemployment are disproportionately high relative to U-3.

One implication, as President Rosengren mentioned, is that the labor force participation rate may Tealbook envisions, and market shortages.  President Fisher, in particular, said, There was some discussion of labor noted increased concern in Texas with the shortage of qualified job candidates.  That

President that part-time workers appear to be holding wage growth down.  By almost all metrics, the overall movements we have seen which is consistent with business contacts at the ability of firms to replace workers with labor-saving technology-and pressures, a phenomenon President Fisher his remarks-could be a further factor holding wage growth down.  In fact, I tendency we've wage may not see rapid enough income gains to support the consumer in Tealbook.

Many of you, like On the issue of sustainability of continued labor I would include in this list Presidents Mester, Williams, George, Plosser, Dudley, Fisher, Bullard,  and Evans and Governor Tarullo-perhaps I've missed some-expressed an expectation that The decline range of evidence suggesting that we are in the midst of a significant

In investment spending should strengthen.  A number of President Lockhart addition, Presidents Lockhart and Evans and Governor Tarullo cited some evidence from surveys and your business contacts suggesting that you described your impressions of business sentiment, with President Evans, I believe, describing it as good, not great, which is consistent with my own impression from recent meetings with business leaders.

Bullard noted that the quarters with negative growth are quite rare and may not, in fact, prove to be transitory, and several of you noted-President Rosengren, I think, noted this particularlythat personally agree that given how frequently we've been burned in the past, some degree of caution readings we've seen on core to continue to reduce the pace of asset purchases.

in recent work with Glenn Rudebusch he found evidence sensitive to short-term increase we have seen in President Williams noted that confirming the view of Kruger, Gordon, and others that inflation is more than to long-term unemployment.

The conclusion that that the issue and it's one that will merit further But I think we need to recognize mandate-consistent levels well before our full employment goal is President Williams drew isn't that the Committee is behind the curve, but rather Committee may need to permit a temporary overshoot of our 2 percent inflation target to counter hysteresis, and I do think this is an important policy discussion in the days ahead.

to the concerns that were expressed that inflation may rise above our target, focused on exactly the opposite concern, that could drift down over time, as in In contrast Presidents Rosengren, Evans, and Kocherlakota inflation may persist below our target for a prolonged time unless we permit unemployment to overshoot our estimate of its natural rate, along the lines contemplated in Tealbook and justified by the analysis described in the Lindner memo.  Under these circumstances, President Kocherlakota emphasized the risk that inflation expectations Japan, and low inflation expectations could potentially become endemic and hard to change.

On balance, you continue to expect that, under our current policy path, inflation will gradually move up toward our 2 percent objective.  Some of you mentioned, as in Tealbook, that this could require a period of running the economy above potential.

and the main risks I heard pertained first of all to global developments, such as slowing China and the possibility that tensions in the Middle East Briefly, on risks to the outlook, most of you mentioned that they seemed reasonably balanced, growth and financial-stability risks in could lead to a sharp increase in energy prices.

Also importantly, Vice Governor Powell spoke financial markets, some compression in credit spreads, reach for yield, and other risks to financial minimum, warrant monitoring.  Let brief comments of my own.  With respect to the outlook, I changed my baseline forecast very much at all since our previous meeting, and I, too, see agree with those who see the decline in U-3 as overstating that degree of rate as reflecting Just adding a couple of haven't the broad range of incoming evidence as suggesting continued improvement in the labor market.

looks like we'll see a pretty in first-quarter GDP, and although most of the decline is due to large negative also seem to retail sales numbers haven't been all that encouraging either. With respect to the prospects for growth and continued improvement in the labor market, I frankly found recent data to be quite perplexing.  At this stage, it alarming decline contributions from net exports and inventories, private domestic final purchases have slowed, and the most recent As Governor Fischer mentioned, it's not clear we should take heart from the fact that net exports either.  There are real crosscurrents here. and inventories declined

this trend will downside risk to the outlook for consumer spending. substantial progress the economy has made toward returning to maximum As I mentioned, I am also worried by the continued failure of real wages to grow in line with productivity.  I agree with Tealbook that as the labor market tightens probably change, but I do see it as a Without denying the

that I, too, am concerned about developments in the signs we may be seeing of complacency in some segments.  In addition in monitoring, I think applying appropriate supervisory and important to lean against any tendency that in markets to view the FOMC as making any unconditional policy promises.

The first paragraph of alternative B updates the Committee's summary of economic developments, noting that economic activity 'has rebounded in recent months,' without explicit reference to the transitory decline in output during the first quarter.

June 17-18, 2014

Chair.  I had a comment and a median dealer purchase to be useful.  It would be, I think, also the concerns about low volatility that we've of the distribution of beliefs in the the median.  That's a comment. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes.  Thank you, Madam question.  The comment is that I found these charts about the expectations and the expected path of the fed funds rate informative to be presenting information about the distribution of beliefs as well.  I think it would be slightly helpful in getting after some of been hearing, because you'd be getting a little bit of a picture market as well as just looking at the SEP.  The SEP shows a slight amount of tightening.  What are The question is about the staff views on how that would be interpreted by markets?

Min described in the briefing little bit higher dots.  The median for 2015 was higher by 12Â½ basis points, and the points.  I think, as we have seen in the past, those dots get a lot of in markets, and I think it will be read as suggesting a little bit tighter path for policy.  I measures of expected policy, OIS will see this afternoon, but I think that's likely. MR. ENGLISH.  The so-called dot plot shows, as yesterday, a one for 2016 by 25 basis attention would expect to see some upward movement in market-based or whatever, as a result of that.  We expectations are a little low to your SEP expectations.  Not only are you above, but you're a little more above, and I little higher. As I think Simon pointed out in his briefing, the market relative think that, again, will push things a

Related to this, would the market take any signal away from an inference that the changing composition of the Committee, and that, by itself, could lead to shift will believe, butMR. ENGLISH.  It's hard to know what market participants MR. EVANS.  I'm just asking for speculation.

Here's a two-hander. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Further questions?

CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes.

DUDLEY.  It's not obvious, though, if the dots change because the VICE CHAIRMAN composition changed, that it doesn't matter.

DUDLEY.  Isn't there a slight offset, Bill, too, though, because the VICE CHAIRMAN long-term equilibrium fed funds rate has come down slightly?

an offset in terms of what MR. ENGLISH.  I'm not sure if that is an offset.  I guess it's should happen to longer-term rates.

Right.  That's what I mean. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

Chair, to do that.  I think emphasizing that this comes from composition could markets at that point to be thinking that this represents a change in the Committee's it certain risks I think. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes.  I just wanted to underscore the point the Vice Chairman just made.  This goes to how we all talk about this publicly.

That carries with just individual believes in the forecast he or she offers, it's also about And just to follow up on the comment I had made about the distribution.  It's not about how much a particular the distribution of beliefs for the period ahead-just to clarify what I was trying to say.

MR. POTTER.  Certainly.

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thanks.

Mester. CHAIR YELLEN.  A two-hander, President

June 17-18, 2014

MESTER.  Yes.  I just wanted to offer that my interpretation is if you look at 2015 as being a factor in sort ofMS. unemployment rates, that forecast has been revised down a bit.  I mean, you can point to economic conditions

(1999) rule to the individual contributions, and look at what those might have implied dots in 2016, say, you can't explain the movement of the dots. MR. ENGLISH.  That's right, but inflation was also marked down.  If you apply kind of a Taylor about the distribution of

MS. MESTER.  The 2015 inflation central tendency was not marked down.

MR. ENGLISH.  That's right.

YELLEN.  Further questions for Bill?  [No response]  Seeing none, and before time has come to clarify for the public the likely timing of the cessation we stay on the path of reducing asset purchases. CHAIR we begin our policy go-round, I'd like to raise an issue with you.  A few of you have mentioned to me that you think the of asset purchases, assuming along the lines we are October meeting with a do we, instead, intend to make another after the meeting with a $5 billion reduction? In particular, assuming the economy continues to progress anticipating, do we intend to bring the purchase program to a close at our $15 billion reduction in the pace of purchases, or measured $10 billion reduction in October, and bring the program to a conclusion December

mentioned to me that you to the view that it would be worthwhile to than later.  I worry that the longer we wait to say something about more we respond by saying that the Committee hasn't yet larger this will loom in the minds of investors.  They may think that we see this as a comes, it will be seen as a significant statement Now, I have been asked this question, and several of you have have as well.  I just want to say that I'm sympathetic clarify this point sooner rather this final step in the program, and the decided, the very meaningful decision, and when the decision

June 17-18, 2014

the economic outlook and the likely timing of interest rate increases, is not a substantive issue at all. about our assessment of even though, in macroeconomic terms, it just idea of getting our decision on this out to the public soon.  One way to do this something in our statement today, and I know there are arguments in favor think that just adding a were to end of the I think would be unwelcome. I like the would be to include of such an approach.  But, I confess, it is not my personal preference.  I sentence, for example, to paragraph 4 that clarifies this, without providing any context, and in a statement that is otherwise notable for its absence of red ink, might well be read as saying something significant about our sense of the outlook.  So, in today's statement, if we make such an addition, it will really stand out.  Moreover, providing detail about the purchase program could also encourage the view that our purchases are on a preset course, which I think is wrong.  Using the statement to convey this information could have effects on policy expectations that

likely that I will get a question on this topic at the would be to actually answer that question, but I is a decision that is not meaningful from regarding liftoff, evolving expectations concerning our actual and expected progress in On the other hand, I think it's highly press conference this afternoon.  My preference would do so in a way that provides the context that this a substantive point of view, that it does not have implications for our intentions which will hinge on our achieving our objectives, and that our purchases remain data-dependent.

approach, and also to get your views on when it would be better to end the program, final step-down in the pace of purchases of $15 billion at the October meeting in minimal purchases that would otherwise continue through December.  I Of course, before doing so, I absolutely want to make sure that you would be comfortable with this assuming that we do continue to reduce the pace of purchases.  My personal preference would be to go with a order to avoid having the

June 17-18, 2014

think that would gain undue focus and attention, but I am completely open to your views on this question.

it if you would indicate reduction be $15 billion In your contributions during the go-round, I would appreciate what your preferences are on the policy issue-namely, should the final or $5 billion?

with is no such question, this issue could, in any case, be covered Also, I'd like to hear your views on the communications issue.  Are you comfortable my providing this information at the press conference, assuming the appropriate question is asked?  And if, to our surprise, there in the minutes with the appropriate context provided.

appreciate your comments on that. Does anyone have any particular questions on that?  Otherwise, we can begin the goround, and I'd just

MR. LACKER.  Can we step down $25 billion in September?

MR. FISHER.  Don't push it, Jeff.  [Laughter]

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It's not in the feasible set.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  President Kocherlakota.

Chair.  Let me start with the proposal just I strongly support the idea of providing this kind of clarification.  I think that if we don't MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam raised. clarify the timing of the end of purchases now, I think we really run the risk, as you indicated, of allowing this very minor detail in policy being seen as a critical signal of our overall stance.

President Lacker's on this-for this last than October.  This is a very minor support the lead of the Committee as a whole on the it's not a strong preference for me. Personally, I'd prefer-and my views differ from $5 billion of purchases to take place in December rather detail in economic terms, so I'm prepared to question of timing.  I'll put my vote in for December, but

June 17-18, 2014

express my preference for that.  That I feel a little more strongly about.  I On the communication issue, I would prefer for this language to be included in the statement, and I will think the FOMC should really be taking ownership of policy decisions like this rather than implying that the Chair has ownership.

last June was a bad precedent along these lines in terms of communication.  I'm have them in the statement.  I'd rather not step, most important thing here, is to clarify this some way.  If your lead, Madam Chair, is to address this in the press conference, I'm I thought not talking just in terms of outcomes, I'm talking in terms of the decision of the Committee to not take ownership of material decisions and not repeat that precedent.  But, again, the important issue in prepared to support your lead on that.

specific change.  I'd like, if I could, to suggest language from paragraph 2 of alternative A, and that language is:  'The I would just clause to paragraph 2 of alternative B. Let me turn next to alternative B.  I'm prepared to support alternative B as written, but I do believe it can be improved.  Let me suggest a that we add the redline Committee anticipates that inflation will return to 2 percent, but only gradually.' add that actually reflect the Committee's consensus outlook on inflation, as much as we can have a in terms of a change, it reflects our own staff's reassessment of us to make that change in the language.  That would be my A couple of things about this new language:  First of all, I think it does accurately consensus outlook.  But underlying inflation.  I think it's appropriate for the FOMC to share that reassessment with the public, so I think it's appropriate for recommended change in the language for alternative B.

that I believe we should take up over the next two Now, let me turn to a policy change meetings.  As I suggested in the previous go-round, I am highly concerned that our current

June 17-18, 2014

policy is focused on to the public that the FOMC is of inflation over the next 5 to 10 years. approach to policy could lead to unanchored inflation expectations.  Our reducing accommodation, and it systematically communicates either unwilling or unable to influence the course believe that we should be planning for the possibility of more-aggressive responses is contained in the language of alternative A, which says extraordinarily low at least until the one- to two-year-ahead is a natural extension of our past threshold-based communications. This message is detrimental to the promotion of price stability and our credibility, more generally.  I to low inflation.  One such response that we will keep interest rates outlook for inflation rises back to 2 percent.  That is in paragraph 5 of alternative A.  This language

language goes far enough.  With this language, the FOMC sets no real continues to suggest that it sees a new normal.  This is what I think would be useful to work next couple of meetings:  How can we build deadlines into our response to I mean, we could be thinking about this.  I think right now the labor about labor market shortfalls as well. Now, given the lessons from the Bank of Japan that I mentioned in the prior go-round, I actually don't think this deadline for returning inflation back to 2 percent, and so it persistently low inflation as part of on over the persistently low inflation? market improvement is proceeding in a gratifying way, but of course this could be applied to thinking way, how can we systematically commit to providing more accommodation return back to 2 percent by, say-and I'm might those steps be?  I think there are at if we're committing to make up for post-2016 misses relative to target with morepurchase program that Put another if inflation and the outlook for inflation does not naming a date out of nowhere-mid-2016?  Now, what least a couple of alternatives on the table.  One is that we could commit to targeting the price level aggressive future policy, or we could commit to embarking on a new asset

June 17-18, 2014

inflation returns to 2 percent.  These are only a couple of and I'm sure there are other approaches that would be useful. accelerates automatically until alternatives, of you may be concerned about the possible impact of these policy on financial stability, and I'm sympathetic to this concern.  Over the past year or so, made a great point in a recent speech.  We need to keep in mind that and price stability more specifically, are really the key a Committee for financial stability.  As I discussed in the risks to that Now, some approaches I've suggested ways for us to take this potential impact into account in our deliberations.  But I thought President Williams macroeconomic stability in general, foundation that we can provide as previous go-round, we should see persistently low inflation as posing significant needed price stability.

Fischer made a couple of comments about whether we should PCE or the CPI.  I'm very open to reconsidering the Committee's decision to focus the inflation target, having to explain what includes food and energy.  That's basically the As I indicated, Governor be using the on the PCE.  I share with him-when I talk about PCE is and what CPI is-my main point is, it only thing I try to communicate-unsuccessfully, by the way.

what that would mean, but going to be at 2 percent.  That's what we as being consistent with maximum employment.  If we run below that, that's basically we think there is going to be downward pressure on inflation expectations, as we saw But I think that, as a Committee, it's worth rethinking about right now our communication is PCE inflation is consider saying that in our own staff's evaluation of expectations.

the conference.  I admit that I suspect I was guilty for your having that defense, but it was very forceful, and I thought a very strong part of your press Madam Chair, you gave a very forceful defense of the FOMC's commitment to 2 percent target at your first press to give

June 17-18, 2014

kind of rhetoric is a powerful tool for central bankers, but at the end of trump words, and we need to be ready in the very near term to take concrete steps to below.  I think having a time-bounded approach conference.  I think that day, actions more effectively defend our inflation target from to accommodation would be very helpful along those lines.

idea that inflation expectations have I'll close with a quick comment on the Summary of Economic Projections.  President Plosser was teasing me in his go-round about my comment that my forecasts are divorced from reality.  It's becoming increasingly true-I'm very amenable to what the Tealbook's forecast for inflation is, but my own forecast for inflation is based on the not drifted below 2 percent, because that would not be consistent with appropriate policy.

to formulate a forecast that is actually based on the way I'm think treating that as a hallmark, the first point of Committee outside of this meeting is increasingly problematic.  I would to have a better way to talk about our outlook than is being offered I have no way to begin thinking about the economy at this point.  I communication for the hope we could work together by the Summary of Economic Projections.  Thanks, Madam Chair.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Fisher.

Chair.  With regard to your question, I agree with the President Kocherlakota, although he has a in the statement, to have a fallback, accepting that you handle this in MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Madam suggestion you've made as to how you wish to handle this matter.  My preference personally, of course, is-and I've said this in speeches publicly-that we close off this program in October with the final $15 billion, and I'm happy to hear personal preference to put it the press conference.

to suggest that that is the best way to proceed, and I'm sure you'll handle it do think it's important to emphasize the fact that from a macroeconomic standpoint, I would like just right.  I

June 17-18, 2014

I fully support the way you suggested it be ownership issue, the Chair speaks for the my standpoint as a close observer, I would say that the Chair has done a than exerting any individual views, and to do so. this is not a handled, and I would also say with regard to the Committee, and from very good job of reflecting the Committee's views rather I know you'll continue like it the way it's written. talked improvement there, we might want to alternative C, paragraph 1, but for now I think it's fine With regard to alternative B, I would suggest no changes.  I The sentence, 'the unemployment rate, though lower, remains elevated'-Bill and I have about this, of course, and eventually if we continue to see migrate to the language that we have in the way it is.

a little apology here as to the way I stated myself yesterday.  Just pretty straightforward.  I don't embrace the suggestion that overshooting target.  Indeed, as I said, I consider is I watch body language, and I ask while I speak, and I noticed that Mr. may have given offense.  I apologize.  As you said, Madam Chair, none of us want to may have gone too far, and if I, watching your body the staff any offense with regard to that paper, I apologize. I want to conclude with to be clear, I think I was full employment is necessary if we're to get inflation up to this the opposite of benign.  But one thing I do at this table Evan Koenig behind me to always watch the body language Wilcox drew up to full seated height, which when he's seated is higher than I am when I'm standing.  I repeat the experience of the 1970s.  I language, David, if I gave you or submissions, I actually expect be a little bit above 2 percent in 2017.  My SEP forecast just had a bit of a rate I want to make it clear that if you look at my own SEP inflation to overshoot, and on the unemployment side my estimate for the natural rate is 5Â½ percent.  I don't

June 17-18, 2014

overshoot as long as it doesn't become endemic, and I want to make that clear.  But in my submission the need for tightening in 2015 and 2016 to contain that overshoot. mind a little I also stress made a suggestion yesterday alongside of an inference made by President want to just spend a minute on that.  This goes issues.  I've spoken about this very low VIX matter for quite some time, both publicly if the economy keeps developing in the way we gentler form of tightening before we actually raise the base rate would be to taper Now, I Rosengren, which obviously went nowhere, but I back to the issue of low volatility, and I'm very happy that Governor Powell has stressed financial and in this forum, but the suggestion was that see it, that a down our repurchases.

lowest they've case, it's at least 50 years and perhaps longer.  All of the that Governor Powell mentioned I have spoken of before, and he put a little more I do think the markets are very, very tender.  I'd like the Committee to along the lines of what I suggested, and I believe Mr. Rosengren was suggesting, that it of signaling to the market that as we get more confidence, we consider again.  We've disabused that before, but before we get to the full bloom of to leave that off the table.  I'd like to keep it on the table, but I against the background of financial complacency, that that might be a gentler way to actually raising the base rate until we're fully confident.  As I said yesterday, I want see before we raise the base rate.  Thank The market is so complacent-for example, British interest rates are the been since the 17th century.  In our indicators muscle behind it, but consider might be a gentler form tapering reinvestments.  I was going to say we were seeing green shoots, but I'm not going to use that terminology ever summer and liftoff-I don't want just view it tighten than to see the whites of the eyes of everything we wanted to you, Madam Chair.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Rosengren.

June 17-18, 2014

alternative B as written.  The statement makes eminent sense at a time when we are path to the taper program.  The weakness in the economy in the first half of this year, coupled with our 'steady as she goes' taper increases in interest rates or increased further disrupted the recovery. MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support minimalist approach to changing the providing a gradual, transparent, and predictable real communications strategy, successfully avoided significant volatility, either of which might have with a less complicated set of tools.  The and predictable slowing in balance sheet to reduce the size of our balance sheet, we may choose to do so gradually actual timing and size of tapered reductions depending on how the Exit strategies can be difficult to maneuver even lessons I take from the four predictable taperings to date, based in part on the positive market response, is that our experience with the gradual increases may be instructive when we begin to reduce our balance sheet.  To be explicit, when it becomes appropriate and predictably with the economy evolves.

as you $4 trillion balance sheet is the definition of rounding error.  As a result, a policy statement or a policy view.  I think it's a technical adjustment.  As a statement.  I actually think that it should be in response to a more seem like an offhand remark because I think that's probably what it deserves. In terms of the two questions that you posed, I am fine with ending the purchases suggest-$5 billion on a I don't view it as result, I don't think it belongs in the question and Thank you.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Plosser.

the following, that the $5 billion is a trivial thing, and that if you think it needs MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  With regard to your question, Madam Chair, I agree with clarifying, we should clarify it.  But information is information, and I do tend to lean toward

June 17-18, 2014

hugely strongly about that, but I think that would be clearer and we technical clarification and, if things go that the last decision would be the $15 billion, and kind of leave President Kocherlakota's suggestion that we could put it in the statement, that would be my preference.  I don't feel could avoid some potential confusion by just saying it's a as we anticipate, then we expect it at that.

can support alternative B as written.  The economy appears to be bouncing weak first quarter and is poised to grow at least somewhat above trend over the next and a half.  I see no reason to deviate from our path of purchase reductions of a couple of other issues on the table that I think we my concerns about paragraph 6 actually have increased. For today, I back from a year to year $10 billion per meeting.  But I do want to put need to be contemplating.  I have, since we instituted it in March, expressed reservations about paragraph 6, and over time that we look at in Tealbook B, that are behavior indicate that we should have an earlier liftoff and a steeper path that rates will rise only very gradually, we should make sure to position move liftoff forward in time relative to what seems to be quickly if that's necessary.  Otherwise, we are not being systematic way.  It may well be that we will be very close to both our if not by year-end, then by zero or negative real rate would be risks to the economy. As I indicated yesterday, most of the policy rules consistent with our past of policy than what seems to be currently conveyed by our statement language.  Even if our current anticipation is our communication so that we can anticipated and move rates up more data-dependent in any inflation objective and our average long-term unemployment rate early next year.  And if that occurs, for me, maintaining a unduly accommodative, and I think that would pose substantial

timing of liftoff will be objectives, which I support, I do not see us as having Even though the language in paragraph 5 indicates that the assessed by our progress toward our

June 17-18, 2014

we've seen in the economy.  We are closer to our objectives than we were six months messaging about offered any such adjustment in our messaging or our statement that reflects the changing conditions ago or a year ago, but we don't seem to have changed our language or our liftoff or about rates.

want to see us get boxed in by our language in paragraph 6.  I think we need communications and anticipated policy action indeed moving closer to our policy objectives for both said we're moving closer. I just don't to begin working on language that will convey more of the concept of a policy reaction function, the factors that are in that reaction function, and the state-contingent nature of future policy. Paying lip service to such a reaction function while ignoring its message or signals is counterproductive.  We need to be adjusting our consistent with the fact that we are inflation and unemployment.  I didn't say we were there yet.  I just language in paragraph 6, and that is the lack of does imply a neutral rate that is 25 basis points lower, if you will, at the pace at which we approach the steady state.  Our policy liftoff, presumably, and so the policy endpoint does not tell us at which we would raise rates, and I think that still remains a question. I have another concern about the specificity in conveying the economic conditions that would keep policy looser for longer.  The staff did introduce a 25 basis point reduction in the long-run natural rate of interest as suggested in Tealbook A, and that end.  But that says nothing about the rules give us the shape of that much about the pace

their long-run equilibrium neutral rate, I guess.  Actually the dot chart indicates a slightly steeper path than the last time.  But I do think we have to be careful, as Looking at the infamous dot chart, as was already noted, many people lowered by 25 basis points there's also Governor Fischer suggested.  Gauging changes in long-run trends is both econometrically and conceptually very difficult to do, and I think we need to do that with great caution.  And I think

June 17-18, 2014

also to the extent we do it, it has to be undertaken to want to let that change in the staff's view be reflected in long-run equilibrium rate or potential growth too much at this point. that we need to not only do it with caution, but in a very disciplined, precise way so that we're happy with the implications of it moving forward and don't need to reverse and go back the other way.  I think we have to be very careful about that.  At this stage, I'm not inclined my views about the already mentioned, I think it would be prudent to begin shrinking our sheet before we start raising rates.  We will soon have the opportunity to do so, as I impact on the stance of policy. In addition, as I've balance alluded to yesterday.  The current reinvestment rates are pretty small, $15 billion to $20 billion, and we could do so with relatively little

Committee chooses not to do that, I think it could to reconsider our reinvestment strategy to bias our purchases in the The alternative, as I suggested, if the very well be prudent reinvestment toward short-term Treasuries, which would also give us more flexibility with our balance sheet as we move forward.  That might be an effective strategy.

the Committee has given the impression to the markets that we are unlikely to assets, especially MBS.  I'm still of the view that this is not a good approach to policy or to size of our balance sheet has the effects we've long asserted, and it's us to raise rates more and higher than we otherwise would to achieve any given Finally, sell our communications.  If the providing accommodation as we claim, then  maintaining a large balance sheet during the exit will require stance of monetary policy.

interest rate policy are intertwined.  To argue otherwise sheet policy.  Why do we want to exit strategy that raises short-term rates higher and faster simply because we do not assets?  I have yet to see a careful analysis of this tradeoff and why selling wouldn't The balance sheet and undermines the credibility of our earlier messages for balance insist on an wish to sell

June 17-18, 2014

the preferable approach.  Now, there could be a story in which there are differential people have argued about the balance sheet, but again, I haven't seen an tradeoffs that are involved, and I think we need to think be perhaps effects on the economy of a higher future short-term rate versus the effects on term premiums or other things that analysis of those challenges and the about that.

MBS because we were afraid about the housing market-that is, we wanted to make course, what that this works, is that having to raise other short-term rates faster and higher to accomplish the not-selling of assets and the provision of credit allocation to housing, on other borrowers.  Why is that desirable?  Why do we I have just yet to hear a coherent case that justifies that sort of One of the arguments that people have, I think, is that we wanted to make sure that we didn't sell sure we continued our credit allocation policies toward housing.  But, of means, if that's the way in order means we are imposing higher costs want to pursue that policy? action.

both in our as we go forward.  But for today, I can written.  I have no strong objections to President Kocherlakota's take a minimalist approach at this meeting.  But I do think that the suggestion has it reestablishes that the Committee is not just worried about inflation being We actually believe that inflation is going to get to our target.  I think there's some merit to I'm not convinced that now is the right meeting to put that in, but I think in the future it I think those are some things we need to work on and need to think about language and in our statements and our policy choices support alternative B as suggestion of adding in that statement from alternative A, although I might have a small bias to sort of say let's some merit because low. that.  But would be worth considering.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bullard. CHAIR

June 17-18, 2014

think-echoing a little bit of what Governor Fischer said-the world is more little bit. MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have just four comments.  I'll enumerate them here, and then expand on them.  My first comment is that, in my opinion, the current policy path is not state-contingent enough.  It is too driven by calendar considerations, along with our median forecast.  I stochastic than what we have in mind as we sit here today.  I'll talk about that a the press conference schedule. the discussion of operating procedure, perhaps an little bit about that. Second, I think these calendar plans are driven in part by I'm going to suggest that for something like off-schedule press conference would be more appropriate.  I'll talk a

think we also have this nagging issue of the meaning of the ending of the QE brought up, Chair Yellen.  We've got $5 billion on the table in the fall. to say that this is a meaningful asset purchase, so I agree with you I'll talk about that for just a minute. Third, I program, which you just I don't think it will be credible on that.

to get back to this issue of reinvestments.  For my comments on Vice Chairman Dudley.  I think he is too way I have always viewed it.  It's a buffer step between ending QE and talk about that a little bit.  I think taking that buffer step out of the exit is going to make for a much rockier ride as we get close to the date of policy liftoff.  Let these points a little bit. Then I want reinvestments, I'm going to put my dove feathers on, so you all have to get ready for that.  And I'm going to disagree with the characterization of hawkish on this issue, so I'll give my case for that.  I think ending reinvestment is actually a buffer step-that's the raising the policy rate, and I think it's going to aid our communication, not harm our communication, so I'll process me just elaborate on too driven by Some of you may recall that last year at this time Chairman Bernanke First of all, I think current policy is not sufficiently state-contingent.  It's calendar considerations.

It was a raucous one.  He said at that press conference that by June 2014, and that QE would be ended.  We are brought the QE program to a close as of this point. had a press conference. unemployment would be 7 percent amazingly far ahead of this schedule on unemployment-we're at 6.3 percent-and far behind on policy adjustment.  We haven't most forecasts predicting rapid growth in the current quarter and through the rest of altering plans and deviating from our preset pace.  Calendarcomponent is a constant, representing longer-term inflation expectations. With the year, we may have to consider based policy has a high risk of getting out of sync with actual economic developments.  Inflation also, in my view, is poised to head higher.  We saw yesterday that, by far, the largest of the staff inflation forecast

reasonable to interpret longer-term inflation expectations as drifting in the not-too-distant future. I do not think it is down at this juncture since, for instance, the SPF expectations of core PCE inflation remain at 2 percent, and other measures are also stable.  Accordingly, I think everyone should add 25 basis points to the staff forecast for inflation, which then puts inflation at target in the medium term. That is certainly how I would interpret the forecast, and my own forecasts have inflation at target or, indeed, exceeding target are declining, then that is a very serious issue, indeed, for the completely with President Kocherlakota on this.  I have advocated this in drifting down at this point.  I'll keep an open mind about it, but I'm not If inflation expectations Committee, and I agree the past, that we definitely need to defend our inflation target from below.  But I'm not convinced that they are convinced about it.  Also, I do not agree that if longer-term inflation expectations are drifting down that that's a problem that can be fixed by cyclical adjustment.

inflation expectations more the economy is going to cycle around those expectations, and it's going to The way I would think about models is that you've got those or less fixed, and that

June 17-18, 2014

longer-term markets would be interpreting that as a cyclical factor, not as a structural factor. really very troubling for the Committee if we cannot center inflation expectations on our we are centered on our goal, and it would take more be very hard to move away from them.  Even if inflation goes above the expectations, It's goal.  But I-again, my view is that convincing to get me to move off that view in the near term.

Our of pressure on particular meetings and particular press conferences.  I monetary policy-which is always a concernmight want to address at that particular juncture. Let me turn to the calendar-based plans.  A lot of our plans are based on the calendar envision press conferences by Chair advocated, and continue with a press conference attached.  Financial markets, in my view, seek reassurance from the Chair that they understand the Committee's current system puts a lot think it mixes messages about the current state of and current interpretation of what is going on in the economy with other longer-term issues that we maybe, one thing we could do is split the latter part off into a separate press could have a separate press conference that would focus entirely on future the questions on that.  You could talk about repo facility until you're blue in the face without bringing in the current of that is you could schedule it when it was appropriate, it on the table as a Maybe, just conference.  You monetary policy implementation issues and focus all the overnight reverse policy stance of the Committee and the day-to-day monetary policy issues.  I'm just suggesting that as a possibility.  One advantage when the Committee felt like we got to the right juncture, so I just put possibility.

issue about ending QE.  As other people have remarked, it is a small it does affect the expected timeline of policy rate liftoff.  I appreciate Chair Yellen credible.  It will be viewed by that the program is effectively over.  I agree Yellen that the last step should probably be just go down to zero, and I would not put the policy statement.  I agree that this is something that could be dealt with, as President Let me turn to the issue, but bringing this up.  I think buying $5 billion in assets is just not markets as essentially zero, and markets will say with Chair this in Rosengren suggested, as sort of an offhand comment and go from there.

this reinvestment issue is a serious one for our exit my dove feathers on here and fly around the room a little bit. the end of the QE program, all about, well, are they going to raise rates at the next meeting, and so on. the policy rate.  It would be clear that the Committee the Committee has enough juncture to go ahead with that decision before actually getting the rate increase. Now, however, I do think that strategy, so, again, I'm going to put Ending reinvestment, in my view, is a buffer step between ending QE and raising the policy rate. One of the things we have been concerned about is, as we get to of the talk is going to be By having this buffer step, it's an intermediate decision that the Committee could make during this period between ending QE and raising is going to have to make that decision, and would suggest that confidence in the economy at that to models that we have.  Even if you think it might have a large in an effective way, as was discussed the size of the balance sheet would fall along a smooth maybe into shorter-term Treasury securities, you ways to manage it.  It doesn't have to just be an It should not have a large effect on the economy, certainly not a large macroeconomic effect according to the macroeconomic effect, you could certainly manage it yesterday-that is, we could stipulate that path, or, if you wanted to do the reinvestment could do some of that.  I think there are various

My interpretations are different.  First, he argued it would signal that the Committee was confident enough to move a step closer to raising the to do, because there's going to be a lot of rate once the QE immediate, raise the policy rate.  Indeed, Vice Chairman than later, which exactly the right time, ideally. My views are different from Vice Chairman Dudley's.  He gave four reasons to move ending reinvestments back in the ending reinvestments would signal the beginning of tightening.  Well, yes, but only in the sense that policy rate.  In my view, that's a useful thing to be able pressure on the Committee about when are we going to raise the policy program ends.  Taking the end of reinvestment off the table would mean that the concrete next step for the Committee would be to Dudley suggested that part of the idea is to get off the zero bound sooner rather I'm not so sure is my sentiment, or maybe the sentiment of the Committee.  We want to get off the zero lower bound at

the Committee has enough confidence to raise the policy rate in the meetings following the Vice Chairman Dudley also cited communications challenges, but my argument is that the end of reinvestment is a helpful and useful buffer step that the Committee can use to signal that date of ending reinvestment.

My own forecast has inflation For today, Madam Chair, I can support alternative B, but I mentioned here do need attention in the coming meetings.

last comment, I am not one that views the inflation target as some kind of it on average over a period of time, and maybe this is much closer to price-level targeting. to price-level targeting.  That's optimal judgments around this it on average, that's fine.  Let me just end Chair. Just as a ceiling.  I do think you should hit something that the Committee should have a broader discussion about.  If you hit your inflation target on average over a period of time, you are going to be It isn't exactly price-level targeting, but it's much closer policy in the kinds of sticky price models that are informing a lot of the Committee.  I'm one that thinks, as long as we can hit with that comment.  Thank you, Madam

It would be very helpful to discussion publicly of associated compensation growth that supports sustainable to me.  That's 1Â½ percent We have a ways to go on this that would be associated with inflation at our objective.  Without this type of steady-state wage growth, it's difficult that inflation is going to be at our target, at least sustainably. My preferred policy rate liftoff is delayed until I ahead inflation is at increase our inflation at the target.

Although we can all, I hope, think it's sensible to handle it as you proposed, and I agree in the statement that would elevate it too much.  Thank you. I do think President Lockhart makes an important point.  I'm done about it though, which is we are and they are driven by the calendar, and for a lot of people, the flip a switch that's more or less confirm that nothing is on a preset path, I think we probably should expect that there is going to be a little bit of reaction there.

This is the first normalization cycle in 10 years, I think, and if I counted correctly, it's the eighth one of one I will have experienced inside these walls.  I've been thinking about ways to learn more about the process and different ways to think about it.  For me, the starting point is baseline, which represents for me an brings the economy to full employment and our time; in the

As a result of all that, working with the Board staff, to see what light they might shed, and market and commentators are out there doing exactly the same thing.  For example, I met the and found a clear pattern under which the increase in a tightening cycle has increasingly taken place before the FOMC's first actual think sheds some light and helps make some sense on last summer's taper look even more oddly Beyond that, it also seems to me useful to learn from the taper, as President Rosengren suggested and others, too, I think, and also to understand how past Committees have approached the problem you might apply to those risks I've started to look at earlier tightening cycles participants with Board staff and also with a hedge fund a couple of weeks ago that had looked at previous seven policy normalization cycles long-term rates in rate hike, which I tantrum.  It also makes the long-end rally of the first half of this year

may also have seen the Goldman piece of last week, which looked at the three tightening cycles that began in 1994, 1999, and 2004, and I went through those cycles in mind.  In both 1994 and 2004, the Committee's the staff's contemporaneous estimate of the natural rate.  In today's forecast, that fits is based on two data points. Some of you prior with the help of Board staff with this piece first rate increase happened at a time when headline unemployment was about Â½ percentage point above pretty well.  That would suggest liftoff around the time of this meeting next year, which is in line with the baseline forecast of Q2.  I know this analysis a full percentage point below the staff's estimate of the natural rate.  The special low inflation of below 1Â½ percent today:  Inflation is unusually low and it's than in any of these prior tightening cycles and expected to remain so; and which a damaged economy is slowly repairing simple policy rules in income targeting.  There's no obvious message in this for me about Interestingly to me, in 1999, the Committee didn't tighten until unemployment was nearly circumstances then, as we all know, I suspect, were persistent for both core and headline PCE associated with the well-known IT-driven productivity gains. And there are obvious special circumstances here further below target there's also the general specialness of this era in itself.  But these are already baked into our forecast, and our policy rate path is now in line with the optimal control simulations and more accommodative than all of the Tealbook B, except nominal liftoff.  Others may see that differently.

think there's a policy stance at this juncture, given I have to say I'm very sympathetic to the risks that were highlighted by President in paragraph 2, but I don't feel strongly about that. MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  I virtue in confirming market expectations of continuity in the recent data. Kocherlakota, having seen them over a period of time in Japan and having alerted my European friends that I thought their policy stance was flirting with dangerously low inflation and causing quite a bit of consternation, but those concerns remain.  I would be comfortable with the proposed addition of the language

With regard to the October termination, I think obviously there is a virtue to clarifying at some juncture.  I'm perfectly comfortable with October.  I would be comfortable with the second date as well.  I do believe that given the continuity represented in alternative B this will be viewed as news, and there will be some importance attached to it that perhaps you don't intend.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman.

DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as motivation was for that statement change. VICE CHAIRMAN written.  I take President Kocherlakota's point, but I think making that change in the language at this meeting at a time when inflation looks like it's actually creeping up, I think people would just have trouble trying to understand what the

June 17-18, 2014

will come up in the minutes, and that will be a fine way to dispose of it. I support the Chair's proposal in terms of the press conference and the $15 billion taper in October.  I don't want it in the statement, and I don't want it in the press conference statement.  I think you want to do it in a low-key way, and if it doesn't come up-and I'll be shocked if it doesn't-it

These Taylor rules use as their intercept likely to be have seen in the housing sector. easy as implied by the the 1Â¾ percent long-run equilibrium real rate, economy should be growing much faster than the trajectory we've actually been on. I also have some thoughts about the surprisingly, all of them show liftoff these rules the long-run equilibrium real rate, which has been lowered to 1Â¾ percent in their latest formulation.  I think they should be using the short-run equilibrium rate, which is considerably lower.  Why should the short-term equilibrium rate be lower?  Lower because we can identify significant headwinds that almost certainly have lowered the equilibrium real rate. This is evident in the sluggish recovery, for example, that we Also lower, though, because of the counterfactual.  If policy were as current level of real short-term rates relative to then the respect to these Taylor rule calculations, if the depressed because of a drop in the participation rule's measure of the output gap is based on the unemployment rate, which rule formulations the output gap because they're taking on board fully the drop in the unemployment me is, I think I've said this over and over again, but I'm going to say it one more the Another issue worth considering with unemployment rate is artificially or temporarily rate, and if the Taylor seems to be the way the staff does it, then it would seem that the Taylor understate rate, which has been driven in part by the participation rate.  That's another issue, I think.  The bottom line for time.  Be careful not to let these Taylor rule calculations influence your assessment of

stance of monetary policy.  Now, we're obviously not doing that because the misleading in the current set of circumstances. appropriate Committee supports alternative B and it's not following the Taylor rule formulation, but I do think these rules are a bit me just talk very, very briefly on reinvestment.  I'm not going to go through the arguments I made yesterday, but just state two things.  One, the reason why I want to end rather than before liftoff is very simple.  Our priority should be to get off the with the dual-mandate objectives.  While it's model-based basis, ending reinvestment first wouldn't supposedly do anything to and long-term rates, or be very minor, we did an experiment last summer that was in in the path of short-term rate think you can model these things.  I think you just see how markets can in a very violent way, and so I don't want to take that risk because if we were to order and did the reinvestment later.  Thank you, Madam Chair. Finally, let all reinvestment after zero lower bound as soon as possible, consistent true that, on a shortsupposedly very similar, in terms of the taper tantrum, and we saw not only a very large rise long-term rates, but we also saw a very significant change expectations.  I don't sometimes react experience that sort of event, we might not be able to get off the zero lower bound as soon as we would if we reversed the

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Well, thank you all for your input on the issue of how to the press conference if it comes up.  I did hear some interest in statement, but as I understood it, you were willing to go along with the press want to downplay the potential for some reaction.  It's because I expect statement, but I think that's real. CHAIR handle October or December.  As we went around, I think the vast majority of you preferred October and to have me do this in putting it in the conference.  I do agree that there could be some reaction to this, and I will do my very best to minimize it, but I don't that that I don't want to see it in the

of proposals for changes, but I think to basically leave alternative B as it is point for a vote. With respect to alternative B, there were a couple overwhelmingly in the go-round, what I heard was support with minimal red ink today.  I would propose and put that forward at this

B as described on pages 6 and 7 of Bill MR. LUECKE.  The vote will cover alternative English's handout and directive B on page 12 of the handout.

There are boxed lunches for those of you who would like to have them or are going to take those of you who are gluttons for punishment, you can watch the press conference in the special study.  The
