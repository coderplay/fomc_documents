MS. RIVLIN.  I  so  nominate  her.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. I  second  the omination. n

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. If here  s nybody  opposed,   don't  ant  to  hear t. t i a I w i

[Laughter] ominations  are losed,  nd  congratulations,  n. Peter  isher. N c a Lyn F

MR. FISHER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  will  e  referring    three b to pages  of olored harts.   They  have  a  peach  cover  and  are omewhere in c c 1/ s front  f ou,  I ope. o y h

The first ge  shows  the  3-month  Euro-deposit tes  ncluding  he pa ra i t current, month  forward,  nd  9-month  forward ates  ince uly   of ast 3a r s J 1 l year.  This hart  herefore vers he  12-month  period  ince he tart  f he c t co t s t s o t Asian  crisis.

In  the  top anel  for he .S.  dollar  ates, u  can  see  that  ost  recently p t U r yo m those ates  ave  continued  heir  entle ecline  rom  their ak  on April 7 at r h t g d f pe 2 the  time  of he all  Street  ournal  rticle. e decline  as punctuated  ore t W J a Th w m recently  y  the arket's  eaction  o  the hairman's  estimony  efore he b m r t C t b t Joint  conomic Committee  on  June  10. I  will ome back  to hat  n  a E c t i moment.  That  leaves he  forward ates  ight  n top  of  the urrent  -month t r r o c 3 rates, ich is he  same state  f ffairs at  xists  n apan, s  you can  see  in wh t o a th e i J a the  bottom  panel.

If ou  look  at  German rates  ver he ourse f he  year  since he tart y o t c o t t s of the  Asian  crisis--shown  he  middle anel--your  irst pression  ay be int p f im m that  urope  has  been  going  its  wn way. Rates ose n  the econd  half  f E o r i s o 1997  and  maintained   bit  ore of   spread etween  current  nd  forward a m a b a rates  n  contrast   the ollar  nd  yen  rates.  ut  on  a  second  and  closer  ook, i o d a B l I  think  ne  can  see  that  ince ecember 1997 German rates  ave  tended o o s D h t move in  the  same  direction   U.S.  rates;  hey eclined  n ecember and as t d i D January,  ose rom  mid-January o  late  pril,  nd  generally  eclined  gain r f t A a d a from  late  pril o he  present.  heir ecent  owndrift  s ttributed    the A t t T r d i a to anticipation    a  larger  sian  effect  n  the uropean  economy and  therefore of A o E the  perception  f   reduced ikelihood   rate  ises  ver he emainder f he o a l of r o t r o t year rom  the CBs  in  advance  of  the CB  taking  ver  on  January  1st. s f N E o A this entle  owndrift as  occurred n  the  last  ouple f  weeks, he  mark has g d h i c o t weakened slightly ainst  he  dollar. ag t

The bottom  panel  indicates at oney market  rates  n  Japan  in  general th m i and  the  Japan remium in  particular  ve  backed  up  quite harply  n  the ast p ha s i p few days.  The backup  has  occurred  ven  though  the  Bank of apan  has  been e J quite  enerous  in  its  erm  operations   the  1- nd  3-month  areas,  ut hey g t in a b t again  have  been  draining  horter turities asured  in  days  and  weeks. s ma me The  widening  of he arious  easures  of he  Japan  premium began  about t v m t two  weeks ago  as  Nippon and  Long  Term Credit  ank problems  came to  the B surface. t s nteresting  at  he  widening  accelerated  om  last  riday o I i i th t fr F t Monday  after  he  announcement  that  here  ight  be  a  merger  between t t m Sumitomo Trust nd  Long Term Credit ank. a B

Turning  to  the ext age, here  re  three anels hat    will  irst n p t a p t I f describe  nd  then  go  over  my thoughts  bout  them.  The  first nel hows a a pa s the  dollar/yen   green  with he  scale  n  the ight  ide nd  the ollar/mark in t o r s a d in  blue ith  the cale n  the eft  ide.  The middle  panel hows constant w s o l s s maturity  .S.  Treasury ields  f  2,  10,  and  30  years. he  bottom  panel U y o T shows the  currency alues f even  currencies  gainst  he ollar.  hose v o s a t d T currencies  re  indexed o pril  10,  which  was the ate f he ank of a t A d o t B Japan's intervention  eration  n  Tokyo. The Japanese en  is op i y shown in  green. he day  before e had  conducted   more modest T w a intervention  eration  n  their  ehalf. op o b

Many  market  participants  ve  observed n apparent  orrelation ha a c between  the  dollar/yen d  various  xchange  rates  nd  rates  n  other sset an e a i a markets.  Having observed his  pparent orrelation, ch they  date ack  to t a c whi b about  April 0,  many in  the peculative mmunity may have  reinforced 1 s co it through  their  wn trading  ehavior  n  the  expectation  aking a  profit. o b i ofm That  certainly s  happened.  But  while  most  market articipants  e ha p ar focused  on  the eakening  yen as  the  cause f he ecent  orrelated w o t r c movements,  I  think  e should ot verlook he  common  thread  f he w n o t o t strengthening llar  nd  the trengthening rk,  which I  have  not  graphed do a s ma here,  s  capital ees  he eriphery  nd  moves into ore  industrial  untries. a fl t p a c co

In  particular,  eems to e that  ver  recent  onths,  the ollar  nd it s m o m d a dollar  ssets  ave  been  strengthening    U.S.  economic  data ave  come in a h as h close o  expectations,  ough  not  so  strong  s  to ppear o equire    policy t th a a t r a tightening   the  Committee.  Indeed,  he ata ave  been  just  eak enough by t d h w to  avoid rovoking   tightening  t  not o  weak as  to  suggest  hat  he nd  of p a bu s t t e the  great  xpansion ight  be  in ight.  hile  I  do  not ave  similar arts  or e m s W h ch f Germany, the  same phenomenon has  been  occurring  here,  ith  the ark t w m strengthening ainst  he  yen,  equity  arkets eaching  ew highs,  nd  Bund ag t m r n a yields  eaching ew lows. r n

The Chairman's  estimony  n  June  10  before he oint  conomic t o t J E Committee,  coming as  it  id n he idst f  much anxiety bout apanese, d i t m o a J Russian,  hinese,  outh  African,  nd  other  sset  arkets,  as perceived  y C S a a m w b the  market  as  something f  a  neon  sign nnouncing he ood  health  f he o a t g o t U.S.  economy in  contrast   much of  the est f he  world.  In  addition, o r o t because  the hairman appears o  have  been  read  in  the arket  as  being oth C t m b on  the  lookout  or nflationary  essures  ut  also uggesting  hat    near-term f i pr b s t a tightening s not  likely,  vestors ok he  testimony  s  a  green ight  o wa in to t a l t buy  Treasury oupon  securities  th  minimal  risk. c wi

Our  joint  ntervention    June  17,  while roviding  omething f  a i on p s o respite om  the ush  of arkets  in  one  direction,  so n  a  sense roved he fr r m al i p t correlation  pothesis,   least  o  some people n  the  market.  In  any  event, hy at t i the  strengthening    the en  provided ome trading  elief  r any other of y s r fo m asset  arkets.  Overnight,  e again ad  something f he  same m w h o t phenomenon. Today,  official  atements   Tokyo that  ade a  permanent st in m income  tax ut  seem more likely  nd  suggested  hat  ne  faction  f he DP c a t o o t L might  support  he rime  minister   his ursuit  f  a  bridge  ank  concept t p in p o b gave  the arket  a  certain  ause.  In  markets ere t  the uarter-end, m p h a q a number of  participants  emed to  cash  in  their  ositions d  take heir se p an t profits me when they  could. his  induced omething f  a  rally  n  the  yen, ho T s o i which  played hrough nto ther sset  arkets. 'm fraid  hat  hile  there  s t i o a m I a t w i a  positive de o  that,  should e  aware  of he ikely  isky  ide,  amely si t we b t l r s n that  his  pisode eems  once  again o e  confirming  n  the arket's  ind t e s t b i m m that  verything  s riven ff he ollar/yen. e i d o t d

Turning  to  the ast  age  and  domestic pen  market  operations,  e l p o th average  effective deral  unds ate  ince our  last  eeting as  been  quite fe f r s y m h close o  the  target te t  5.51  percent.  ut  as  you  can  see n he attern  f t ra a B i t p o funds  rate rading  ver he hree aintenance eriods, e  daily ffective t o t t m p th e rates  ave  tended o scillate  tween  slightly  ft  arly  n  the eriods  nd h t o be so e i p a somewhat firmer  oward  the nd  of he eriods. ou can  see  the  slight t e t p Y down/up,  down/up pattern  n  the ffective  tes, e ed  horizontal nes. i e ra th r li This  is ot  quite  ow I  think  e should e  going  about eeting he n h w b m t Committee's bjective  f  an  average ate.   would  prefer  o void he o o r I t a t apparent  nstability  t  tems  from  having he arket hink f  us  as  content i tha s t m t o with  the scillation     negative  utocorrelation tern.    would  rather  hat o ofa a pat I t they  think f s  and  anticipate  r  operations   being irected  ore  toward o u ou as d m a  reversion   the ean. I  do  not et ntirely derstand  hy we have  had to m y e un w this  roblem  of   soft  arket  early  n he aintenance eriods.  t ay p a m i t m p I m simply  be  that  e have  switched  ack  and  forth  rom  adding o raining w b f t d reserves  s  the eeds  worked  out  that  ay. It ay also e  that  here a n w m b t continues  o  be  some volatility he attern  f  major anks' articipation t in  t p o b p i the  Treasury ax  and  loan  accounts. ome  of hem  raise  nd  then ut heir t S t a c t capacity,  nd  this  s eading  o ome inherent  nstability he arket. a i l t s i in  t m

In  the ast  ew days, arkets ave  been  anticipating  e sual l f m h th u pronounced  quarter-end ghtness   the  market.  Today,  federal  unds re ti in f a trading  bove a 6 percent s  we thought hey  would,  but his  s   major a t t i a payment day.  We  have  tried  o  address he ressures.  ou can  see  the t t p Y softish ne  we gave  the arket  yesterday  n ur  effort  o nticipate  day's to m i o t a to tightness.  e  have  been  trying  o eet  that  s  best e can.

MR. BROADDUS. I  don't  ave  a  question, .  Chairman,  but   would  like  o h Mr I t comment about  some of  the ecent  oreign  xchange  market  developments.   will  e  brief. r f e I b Specifically,  ee  a  risk  n esisting  e epreciation   he en, f  hat  egins o  occur gain. I  s i r th d oft y i t b t a Obviously,  he ountries   East sia  face n  extraordinary,  allenging,  d  difficult ustment t c in A a ch an adj problem; e all now that.  There  are  no  good  choices or hem  as  I  see  it.  eflationary rces w k f t D fo in  Japan ave  now pushed  that  ery  important  conomy into ecession. onsequently, e  yen h v e r C th has  depreciated  ery  sharply  gainst  he  dollar  ver he  last  everal  eeks.  The depreciation y v a t o t s w ma indeed ave  been  disorderly ough  that t  arranted ntervention. o  not  know. I  certainly h en i w i I  d recognize  hat  ontinued  en depreciation ises    lot f roblems  around  the  world.  It aises  he t c y ra a o p r t threat  f nother  ound  of urrency  epreciation,  pecially    the ast sian  region. ut  the o a r c d es in E A B performance f  the apanese conomy,  as  everybody  here nows,  is ritical    the conomic o J e k c to e health  f  that  egion nd  to he ealth  f he orld  economy generally. d at his  oint,  s  I  see o r a t h o t w An t p a it,  he  exchange  rate  s ne  of he ew flexible ices  hat  an  adjust  uickly  nough  and t i o t f pr t c q e substantially ugh  to elp he  Japanese conomy in  the ear  term. eno h t e n

I  hope  that  s  we go  forward e will eep  in ind  that  ny  international ort  esist a w k m a eff or further n  depreciation  rries  ome important  isks  f  its  wn. The  reason s hat  t  as ye ca s r o o i t i h potential nsequences or oth  Japanese  and  U.S.  monetary  policy.  undamentally,  o  prevent co f b F t a

further n  depreciation   nderlying  conomic  forces  enew  downward pressure  n  that ye ifu e r o currency,  ither  he ank of apan  must  pursue  a  tighter netary  policy  r  we must  pursue e t B J mo o a more accommodative  monetary  policy  r  some combination f he wo.  The former,  f  course, o o t t o risks  n  even  deeper ecession  n apan.  The latter  sks  reating  tronger flationary ssures a r i J ri c s in pre in  the .S.  economy at   time hen,  at  least  n  my view, ising  nflation   lready    risk.  hese U a w i r i isa a T obviously  ould  be  very  undesirable nsequences  n  two  crucial  conomies.  Indeed,    case w co i e a could  be  made that  e really ed  just  he pposite,  more expansionary  onetary  policy  n w ne t o a m i Japan  and  a  less  xpansionary  ne  here. e o

I  do not retend,  bviously,  now the est  ay to  address  ll f he  very  difficult p o tok b w a o t questions  e face n  this  ubject  s  we go  forward.   suppose ne  could rgue hat  his w o s a I o a t t Committee should e  prepared  o  follow   more accommodative  policy  han t ight  otherwise b t a t i m to  facilitate ustment  n  East sia.  Such a  policy  ould, f  course,  end o  stabilize  e adj i A w o t t th exchange  rate. ut  it  s ot bvious o e that  he otential nefits  rom  stabilizing B i n o t m t p be f the yen/dollar te,  ven  though  there  learly uld  be  some significant  nefits  east  n  the  short ra e c wo be atl i run, re  worth  risking  he otentially  verse onsequences or oth  the  U.S.  and  Japanese a t p ad c f b economies, iven  the nderlying  onetary  policy  ctions  hat  ight  be  required  o  maintain  he g u m a t m t t yen/dollar te t  or ear ts  urrent  evel  oing  forward.  Again,  these re he wo  largest ra a n i c l g a t t economies  in  the orld  and  they re rucial  o he ealth f he orld  economy. It ay be  that w a c t t h o t w m the  least-worst  oice n  this  ituation   o  let  he en  depreciate rther  nd  deal ith  the allout ch i s ist t y fu a w f from  that  n sia  and  elsewhere n he orld  as  best  e can.  On a  more positive te n  that i A i t w w no i context,  ther sian  economies  clearly  ould  benefit  ver ime  from  the tronger  apanese o A w o t s J economy that  n  easier  onetary olicy  n  Japan  would  foster,  en  if  he ost n he ear erm a m p i ev t c i t n t were  a  weaker  yen.  I ust  anted  to  make those omments. Hopefully,  hey ill e  helpful. j w c t w b

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let  me just  ay  that    do  not hink  nyone  at he s I t a t Treasury ould seriously sagree  ith  the ay you  framed  the ssue.  here  was a  great w di w w i T reluctance   the  Treasury o  intervene,  d  the ecision  as touch-and-go  or   considerable at t an d w f a period f  time.  I  would  say hat  he hances f epeating ch  intervention  rge n  the  remote o t t c o r su ve o or  even  less  han hat.    believe  here s   real  nderstanding at  apan's t t I t i a u th J or  more effort  o  stabilize  e en  in pril learly  emonstrated  hat  ntervention  r  se  does  not ork. If t th y A c d t i pe w we ever  needed  any  demonstration, at  as it.  he only  reason hat  ntervention  emed  to th w T t i se work in  the  latest isode ad  nothing o  do  with he ize f he ntervention.   as the esult ep h t t s o t i Itw r of what  somehow  was perceived  s  a signal  hat  ither  e were  going  to ase  monetary  policy  r a t e w e o the apanese ere  going  to ighten.  learly,  either licy  ption s ven  remotely n  the  agenda J w t C n po o i e o at his  tage. t s

MR. BOEHNE.

The issue  hat  ed Truman alluded  o  is   very onsiderable ncern n  this t T t a c co i government  beyond  the  financial ficials--people  he  White  House,  the  State  epartment,  nd of in  t D a the  security encies--that e action  ill ave  to e  taken o revent he  collapse  f  the ag som w h b t p t o Russian  economic  system.  The question  hat  s riving  veryone o  the all  is hat  type  of t i d e t w w conditionality   be  imposed.  As Ted  has  mentioned nd  his olleagues  ave  reaffirmed   a can a c h in fairly  xplicit nner, he  Russians ave  a tax tructure   the  moment that f  t  ere  fully e ma t h s at i i w enforced nd  fully  omplied  with, ould  make everyone ankrupt. s a  consequence,  eople a c w b A p are  given  the hoice f aying  their  axes egally d  going ankrupt r ot aying  them  at  all. t c o p t l an b o n p I is ery  difficult  be  somewhere in  the iddle.

MR.  FISHER.

MR.  FISHER. It eaked  this  ime n  the igh  142's,  riefly uching 43. It  s lear p t i h b to 1 i c that  he arket  is oing  to e  on  guard or urther  ntervention.  ould  be  the irst  ay  that t m g b f f i I  w f tos intervention  thout  ome message  is ot  going  to  be  very ffective,    our  South  African riends wi s n e as f found  when they rchestrated  eir  wn intervention. e  Bank of ngland oined  ith  us  in o th o Th E j w trying  o  warn  them  that  rying  o atch  the peculators llar-for-dollar out ome new t t t m s do with s message  about hat  was  going  on  probably  ould  not ave  much effect.   fact,  t  as w w h In i w counterproductive.  at  kind  of  intervention  eates  he iquidity  lusion  at  peculators n Th cr t l il th s ca turn ver  their sitions d  get heap  dollars. o po an c

I  should dd  that  n erms  of arket xpectations,  e  financial rld  was coming  to a i t m e th wo an  end  as  of ust    week ago, nd  the apanese ere  going o  be  completely ncapacitated   he j a a J w t i int view  of ost  foreign  xchange  traders.  learly, e apanese ave  been  able o eat hose ow m e C th J h t b t l expectations!  alluded  o ome announcements  and  some comments that  hey  made about I t s t permanent  income  tax uts. o,  the apanese re eating  he xpectation at  hey  would  do c S J a b t e th t nothing.

I t y de on ba

MR. TRUMAN. It epends  on  which  trade-weighted  sis  ne  uses.  It s   fact  hat d ba o i a t the  yen  has  not epreciated   much on a  broad  trade-weighted  sis--it  s  depreciated ightly d as ba ha sl on  that  asis--as    bviously  as  against  he ollar.  n  fact, at  s art  f he rgument.

It lso sn't  ear  n  the ther ide hat  ven  if  he en  depreciates,    s ikely  o a i cl o o s t e t y it i l t provide uch net  stimulus  o he apanese conomy.

If e were starting  resh  oday, w i G w af t we would write own something  in  the  low  4  percent  ange. d r

Some of  the  surprise  hese ata ppears o  have  reflected ifferent int d a t a  d split  f uto ales  etween  consumption nd  producers'  urables, ich o a s b a d wh does  not  affect  DP.  But  that  s nly art  f he  shortfall,   we would G i o p o t and now trim  our  forecast r econd-quarter P  growth  to  about  1-1/2  percent. fo s GD Seemingly, ome of  what  the DP  gods  unexpectedly  ave  us  in he irst s G g t f quarter  hey ay have  taken  away in  the econd--still ving  s, hough, t m s lea u t with  a  quite  mpressive  verall  irst-half  formance or DP. i o f per f G

In  the op anels,  ou  can  see hat e are  forecasting arked slowing t p y t w a  m of  the conomic  expansion. he thin ed ine hows  the uarter-to-quarter e T r l s q movements in  real DP, while  the lack ine  aptures  he  broader ontours G b l c t c via  a  four-quarter  rcent  hange. e  believe  hat  rowth  will emain  low pe c W t g r over  the ext ix uarters--indeed,  siderably low  the  trend rowth  of n s q con be g potential tput,  hich  we put t  almost  -3/4  percent  ver his  eriod. ou w a 2 o t p

Under  these ircumstances,  expect o  see  unemployment drift c we t upward,  as  indicated   the iddle  panels. y the nd  of his  ear,  he in m B e t y t jobless  ate pproaches  -1/2  percent  nd  by  the nd  of 999,  5 percent. r a 4 a e 1

Although  we anticipate  at  ominal  bond  yields  ventually ll ack th n e wi b up  a  bit,   you  can  see n  the op  panel,  here  re o  really  xciting as i t t a n e movements in  real  ates  n  the  forecast. ven that  he conomy has  been r i Gi t e chugging  along  in he ace f he urrent  onetary  policy  etting--at st  p t f o t c m s lea u to  the urrent  uarter--this ht  naturally ad ne  to sk  what  we think  s c q mig le o a i going  to  produce  the ustained akening  of ggregate  emand growth  we s we a d have  predicted.

From the  financial de,  ne  answer  is erely  that  e do  not ave  a si o m w h repetition    the ecline  n  longer-term tes  hat  as  provided    boost o of d i ra t h a t economic  growth  over  the ast  ear. ut  another  nswer  can  be  found  in p y B a our  stock arket  forecast.   are nticipating  ecline  f ust  ix ercent m We a a  d o j s p in  share rices,  ccurring  ver  the ext  several  onths.

I  won't ake p  your  time  with  the mpteenth o S t u u restatement   our  skepticism  egarding  he ustainability  hese aluation of r t s of t v levels.  he panel oints  p  just  ne  extraordinary  pect f he arket's T p u o as o t m performance--which  s hat  he /E  is ot  only t  an  historic  gh, ut  that, i t t P n a hi b in

Indeed, t  s ur  sense hat  he urrent  arket  level  eflects,   art, i i o t t c m r inp unrealistic  pectations out  future  rofitability. lower  left nel ex ab p The pa shows the  divergence  etween  Wall  Street  trategists'  dictions  r b s pre fo earnings  nd  our wn.

In  any  event,  he nd  of he tock arket  uptrend  ill tself t e t s m w i remove another  ource f mpetus  to emand. s o i d

Finally,   fixed-income  arkets,  e expect hat,  f  nd  as  the in m w t i a economy shows signs f  persistently wer rowth  and  weaker  profits, o slo g lenders  nd  bond  investors ll urn   bit  ore cautious.  s you can  see  at a wi t a m A the  right, ere  as  been  only  a  slight dening  of isk  remiums  in  the ond th h wi r p b market  to  date,  nd  that  eflected   east  n  part   heavy  supply f ew junk a r atl i a o n bond  issues  ather an  a  fundamental hift  n nvestor titudes.    expect r th s i i at We spreads o  remain  relatively est, ut  again,  e see  things  oving in  a t mod b w m less timulative  rection an  they ave  over he  past ouple  of ears. s di th h t c y

One of  the ain  factors  ehind his  pparent  estraint    the ricing m b t a r on p power  of usinesses  as  been  the apid  xpansion f roductive  apacity. b h r e o p c Manufacturing apacity  tilization,  wn in  the  middle  left nel, c u sho pa essentially  s  been  moving sideways  at   relatively  utral  evel or bout ha a ne l f a two years. oreover,  we anticipate  at  he eakening  of ctivity    the M th t w a in factory  ector  ill  esult   some reduction  f tilization es  ver  the ext s w r in o u rat o n year  and  a  half.  onsistent th he iew  that  here re ew pressures C wi t v t a f on industrial  pacity, rchasing  anagers'  reports  n  vendor ca pu m o performance--the ght  anel--have  een  nearly  alanced  n  recent  onths ri p b b i m between  those eporting  lower eliveries  d  those eporting ster r s d an r fa deliveries.

In  addition  o mple domestic apacity, e  spill-over  om  Asia  has  left t a c th fr a  clear  ark on  global  ommodity markets  and  should rovide ome further m c p s damping of  inflation  essures.  on-oil ommodity prices--the  wer  left pr N c lo panel--have  lummeted over  the  past ear,  nd  we are ot  anticipating h p y a n muc if  ny  recovery n  these rices  ver he orecast terval.  rather  imilar a i p o t f in A s story  as  been  apparent  n  oil  arkets. eakening world  demand and h i m W excess  inventories  at  uilt   over he arm winter  ave  pushed  prices th b up t w h sharply ower  in  recent  onths.

MR. POOLE. I'm  not  so  sure bout hat, t   think  t  s ery asy  to xpress  hat  n a t bu I i i v e e t i a different  y.

Thirdly,  nd  this  s he ost  important  omment,  it  eems  to  me that  he nternal a i t m c s t i structure   your  forecast kes perfect  ense f  rowth  in  final  ales  lows. he components  of of ma s i g s s T the  forecast uld  be  internally  nsistent. t  I  still    not  understand  here  the rive  o  slow wo co Bu do w d t the  growth  of ggregate  emand comes from.  The  real ederal  unds ate  s alling ring his a d f f r i f du t period ecause  you  have  the  CPI  rising  nd  presumably nflation  pectations,   east  n he b a i ex atl i t model,  are onsistent th  the  CPI.

It eminds  me a  lot f he  debates  hen I  first me into his  rofession   the ate  960s r o t w ca t p in l 1 when we were  hanging  everything  or   slowdown of  the conomy on  federal  iscal straint. f a e f re

The Asian  impact s  very  much like    restraining  scal licy.  e  all now what  happened  in i a fi po W k the  late 960s  environment. he fiscal straint    1968 did ot  in  fact  low  the conomy. So,  I 1 T re in n s e am very  worried hat  e are utting  uch too  much weight  on  Asia  in  this  utlook  nd  that  e t w p m o a w are ot  paying nough attention   the  underlying  trength  f  aggregate  emand as  driven y n e to s o d b very  accommodative  monetary  and  credit  onditions. c

MR.  PRELL.  Peter ooper  will ay  something n  response  o  your  question  bout il H s i t a o prices.

MR.  HOOPER. Just o  address he il rice uestion,  think  he ump in  the  futures t t o p q I t j reflected EC's recent  greement  to  cut  production  y  somewhat more than  we had  assumed  in OP a b our  forecast.  ur  oil xperts  oubt  that  PEC O e d O will ome through  and  actually strain c re production  s  much as  the  agreement  suggests.  ut  there  s ome upside isk  n  the il  rice a B i s r i o p forecast  n  light  f hese ery ecent  vents. i o t v r e

MR. PRELL.  I  think ne  has  to  ask, oo,  hether  the urrent  rices  re ot o t w c p a n abnormally ow because  of  the  oil torage  onstraints.    are etting    contango n  the arket l s c We g a i m that  ay be extreme.  There  also re ome fine oints  n  the urrent  ituation  at  ay be m a s p i c s th m exaggerated.

MR.  TRUMAN. Peter  ooper is  right.  ou are  a  little  ead  of s  in  terms f H Y ah u o looking t  the ewspapers  this  orning.  The Greenbook  as  of he  time  it  ent  to ed  actually a n m t w b had  an  implied  onthly  forecast rough he  end  of he  year hat  as almost he  same as  the m h t t t w t market  futures.  here  was a slight riation   we went  out  into 998,  but   think  hat  as T va as 1 I t w largely    function  f he  market's  dding  some risk  remium about  uncertainties h  as  whether a o t a p suc Iraq  will ontinue  o roduce  and  so  forth.  hat  actually s  been  a  feature  f ost  of he ecent c t p T ha o m t r forecasts   the  sense hat  e go  with  a  point  stimate  f upply nd  the arket as  more of n in t w e o s a m h a

D t t G b t f we More recently,    Peter aid,  e had  the PEC as s w O announcement  on Tuesday  and  the urrent c market  may now have  a  somewhat different terpretation  n  the  one  we assumed  before e in tha w learned  bout  the PEC  decision. a O

MR.  PRELL.  As to  the eneral utlook or omestic emand,  your  point  s ell g o f d d i w taken.  There  is n  alternative  ew  in  which  the ultiplier-accelerator  cts at  low  from  the a vi m effe th f external  hock  and  the nventory  nvestment  orrection  e nadequate  o recipitate  e ind f s i i c ar i t p th k o slowing  of mployment growth  and  domestic emand expansion hat  e are  anticipating.  re e d t w We the  stock arket  to ontinue  oing p,  that  ould  certainly d  something o  the rospective m c g u w ad t p growth  of omestic emand.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. There  is n  interesting  sue  ere. Everyone  has  been a is h wrong by  underestimating  mestic emand and  wrong in  the ther irection  overestimating do d o d by inflation.  e area here  the rror  s rucial  as  been  productivity  cause  as  productivity Th w e i c h be growth  has  accelerated,  pectations out  earnings  ver he  long un  have  moved up. This as ex ab o t r h created    major  increase  n  stock rices  nd  a  virtuous rcle alth ffect.  e  end  up  with 1) a i p a ci we e W ( much higher  omestic emand and  (2)  lower  prices  ecause f he  acceleration    productivity d d b o t in that  as  occurred.  The  Greenbook  forecast corporates  significant  owdown in arnings h in a sl e growth, hich  in  turn omes largely  rom  a  slowdown in  productivity  ins. f hat  appens, w c f ga I t h then  the rowth  in pending n  capital ods  also lows  and  that  reates  ome negative  nternal g s o go s c s i multipliers  at  onform  total  pending o  the reenbook  forecast  uch slower xpansion  n th c s t G ofm e i demand. The only  thing hat  resumably ould eep  the tock arket  on  a  rising end  s hat  e t p c k s m tr i t w are  wrong again n  productivity.  at  would  mean that  arnings  xpectations,  ich are ow in o Th e e wh n the  area f  13 or  14  percent  ver  the ive-year me  frame  used  by  security alysts, uld o o f ti an wo continue  o  move up, tock rices  ould  continue  o ove up, nd  effective mand would t s p w t m a de continue  o  rise  uite  ubstantially.   unanswered  question  s hat  would  happen  to nflation t q s The i w i in  that  ontext.  hat  is hy I  think  he rucial  rror  n ur  forecast dels  has  been  the c T w t c e i o mo productivity  mbers. I  believe  t  s   mistake o  view  the ssue  f aving een  wrong on  the eal nu i i a t i o h b r side ndependently  f  also aving een  wrong on the nflation  de. he implication  f he i o h b i si T o t analysis  e have  relied  n  is hat  f omestic emand is onsistently  derestimated   the  future w o t i d d c un in and  the reenbook is rong,  inflation  ll  e  stronger. at  is ot  necessarily  ue  ecause he G w wi b Th n tr b t effect  n  inflation  pends  on  where  the omestic emand is oming from. o de d d c

I  would  say  at his  oint hat  e have  a  very  tough  set f orecasts    make on  both t p t w o f to sides.    am not  terribly  rtain  here  the alance ffectively  y be.  My  own concern,  s  I  will I ce w b e ma a

try o  express omorrow,  is hat  he dds  of  a  very  significant  gative  ffect  n he nternational t t t t o ne e i t i area,  hile  still  w,  are ising. at  is here  the  big ownside  potential  es.  he  upside w lo r Th w d li T potential  hat  he  stock arket  will ontinue  o  rise  ndependently  f ny  productivity  anges, ist t m c t i o a ch and  we will et erious  nflationary ssures  oming largely  rom  the age side,  s  we g s i pre c f w a discussed.    think  e are  in n  area ow where  both  the pside nd  the ownside  risks  re uch I w a n u a d a m larger  han e have  been  presuming.

MR.  PRELL.  There  is n obvious ircularity  our  forecast   that, re  it  ot  for he a c in in we n t slowing  of emand,  we would  not  have  the yclical celeration    productivity  at  ave d c de in th D Stockton alked  bout  and  the elated  eterioration  profits.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Meyer.

MR.  MEYER. Peter,   ust  anted  a  few  more details   the essimistic  ia Ij w on p As scenario.  hen  you start t  with he  yen  depreciation    that  cenario,  you "add  factor" W ou t in s do down any  other  arts  f apanese ggregate  emand or  is hat  he  hit  n  it? p o J a d t t o MR.  HOOPER. We  "add  factored"  oth he  yen  and  aggregate  emand. b t d

MR. MEYER. Okay.

MR. HOOPER. We  stipulated  at  e were  going  to  reduce rowth.  What we did th w g was to  impose  an  exogenous  negative  sychological   confidence  ffect  Japanese ggregate p or e on a demand in  the odel. Everything  lse  qual,  f  he en  were  to  depreciate  he xtent  hat  t m e e i t y tot e t i does  in  the essimistic  enario, e  model would  normally ive s  a  rise  n  Japanese DP.  We p sc th g u i G stipulated  at  his  as a  combination f   currency hock  and  an  aggregate  emand shock th t w o a s d through  confidence  ffects. e

MR. MEYER. So,  the alling ian  GDP  is mposed  exogenously.  Let  us  come f As i back, hen, nd  follow hrough n President  roaddus's  uggestion  hat  e let  he  yen t a t o B s t w t depreciate,  ether t s o  160 or  175. If ou  had  not mposed  the xogenous  shocks o wh i i t y i e t aggregate  emand in  Japan  and  the est  f  Asia  and  had  just  ssumed  that  he revailing d r o a t p weakness  in  Japan, f  e stepped ack  and  allowed t  o  happen, ould lead o his  epreciation, i w b i t w t t d how would  that  ave  changed  your  overall  iew  of his  icture? h v t p

MR. HOOPER. If ll ou  do  is et  he en  go,  this  s ositive r apan.  The  effect  f a y l t y i p fo J o this  urrency  hock  on  the est  f sia  is ot hat arge  n  the odel.  The  model  does  not ick p c s r o A n t l i m p u the  related  ncertainty d  confidence  ffects. u an e

MR. MEYER. So,  the hinese  currency  ould  hold  and  the ong Kong spillovers C w H would  be  contained.

MR. HOOPER. Another  shortcoming f he  model  is hat  t  oes  not apture o t t i d c borrowing  denominated  in  foreign  urrencies,  d  the ealth ffects  re ather  inimal. c an w e a r m

MR. TRUMAN. Governor  Meyer,  I  think  he roblem  here,  f  ou  want  to ut t  n  a t p i y p i i slightly  fferent  y,  is hat  hese sian  countries ose currencies ve  lost  0, di wa t t A wh ha 3 50, or 80 percent  f heir  alue nd  have  negative  rowth  rates  f 0  percent  f DP  present    challenge o t v a g o 2 o G a

But  it  s lso,    think,    reasonable  roposition  at  his  ind  f ccelerated  ee g i a I a p th t k o a fr fall  f urrencies re  often han  not  is ssociated th  declines  n  real DP  rather  han o c mo t a wi i G t increases  n eal DP.

MR. JORDAN. Thank you. I  want  to  ask  a  general  uestion  bout he ay we think q a t w about  Japan.

These  commentators  do  not  seem to st o t g i g believe  s  I  do  that  he ature  f   market conomy is  to isplay  n  inherent  esiliency  d  a a t n o a e d a r an tendency  to  expand  in he  absence f egative  mpulses. hen  I  try o igure  ut hat  is t o n i W t f o w preventing  xpansion n  an economy like  hat,  look  for eadwinds  problems ike ur  own in  the e i t I h l o early art f  this  ecade. p o d

One way to  think bout apan  in  my view  is hat  ver he ourse f  the  1990s  the a J t o t c o Japanese ave  been  learning  hat  apan  is ot mmune  to  the  law  of ne  price ny  more than h t J n i o a other  ountries. ometimes  analysts, pecially  ademic  types,  end o  think  f  exchange  rates c S es ac t t o mainly  in erms  of   fairly rrow  set f radable ods.

MR. HOOPER. On the  fiscal de,  here s o  question.  ver  the ast hree  r  four si t i n O p t o years,  he  growth  that  e have  seen  in  Japan as  been  largely  ssociated th ovements in t w h a wi m Japan's  tructural  dget  deficit.    1996,  they ad  a  large iscally-induced  ansion f DP. s bu In h f exp o G At  the ime,  e thought onditions re  beginning  o urn round  in apan.

MR. HOOPER.

MR.  PARRY. Mr.  Chairman,  the ace  of  economic  growth  in  the welfth istrict  s p T D ha remained  strong  n  recent  onths, nd  some of he  tightness   local  abor nd  housing arkets i m a t in l a m is  showing  through o ages and  consumer  prices.  n  Arizona,  he astest owing  state  n  the t w I t f gr i nation,  ob rowth  has  been  running  t ore than  a  4-1/2  percent  nnual ate.  evada and j g a m a r N Washington  are  not  far  ehind ith  recent  mployment  growth  at  a  rapid    percent  ace. b w e 4 p Growth has  slowed  a  little   alifornia,  ich  has  been  somewhat more affected an ther inC wh th o states  y  the rop  in  exports  o sia  and  the ickup n  import ompetition.  he slight owdown b d t A p i c T sl largely  as  been  confined  o he  state's  nufacturing  ector, d  overall  alifornia  b rowth h t t ma s an C jo g still  s  been  solid, out   percent  t  an  annual ate.  arther  est  in awaii, ecent  conomic ha ab 3 a r F w H r e developments ave  been  decidedly  ore negative  s  the ffects  f  reduced sian  visitor h m a e o A spending ave  rippled  hrough hat  sland  conomy. h t t i e

Although  the  Asian  situation  s  had  disruptive  fects   real ctivity    the welfth ha ef on a in T District,  nsumers  have  been  benefiting  east  emporarily  rom  the elated  eclines  n rices co atl t f r d i p

of  imports  s  well s  the enerally  ow  prices  f  commodities. owever,  we have  seen  some a a g l o H recent  ickup  in  price  ncreases  or  ontraded  oods  and  services.  ousing  markets re  tight p i f n g H a in the istrict,  d  the egional  PI  has  been  boosted o  a  noticeable tent  y  an  acceleration    its D an r C t ex b in housing helter  omponent.  For  example, PI  housing  shelter sts  n  the an Francisco  ay s c C co i S B area ave  jumped about  percent  elative   a  year arlier,  d  rents  lso re  picking  p  in  Los h 7 r to e an a a u Angeles.  In  the acific  orthwest,  here  a  tight  abor  arket  has  led o   pickup n  wage P N w l m t a i inflation, sumer  prices  or ervices  ther  han ousing lso re  increasing   a  fast  ace. con f s o t h a a at p

Turning  to  the ation,  e continue  o  see  a  divergence  etween  our  structural  recast n w t b fo and  the conomy's  actual  erformance.  On the  one  hand, ur  structural  del continues  o e p o mo t predict  lower rowth.  Real  GDP  is rojected  o row at   2-1/2  percent  ate  n  the econd  half  f s g p t g a r i s o this  ear nd  a  less han  percent  ate  n  1999.  The huge  inventory  uildup  n  the irst  arter y a t 2 r i b i f qu is responsible r uch of  the ear-term  lowing urrently edicted  y  the odel. Weakness fo m n s c pr b m abroad  also s n  important  eason or he  slower rowth.  More generally,  e  forecast i a r f t g th of demand is  constrained   the  relatively h  level f he  real hort-term  nterest  te. by hig o t s i ra

On the  other  and, ncoming  data ontinue  o  show a  stronger-than-expected  nomy. h i c t eco Among  the  prominent ecent  xamples  are  the mployment and  industrial  oduction  eports r r e e pr r fo May.  Together ith  a  rapid  xpansion f iquidity, se ata uggest  hat here  ay be  a w e o l the d s t t m substantial  side isk  o  the orecast at  alls  or   marked  slowing f rowth.  Even in ur up r t f h c f a o g o forecast  f  slower rowth, he ow unemployment  rate ill ontinue  o  exert  pward  pressure  n o g t l w c t u o wages. This  pressure  s ffset  y  a  number of actors cluding  n  increase   trend  roductivity i o b f in a in p growth, iminished  nflation  pectations,  e  higher  ollar,  d  increased  rice  ompetition d i ex th d an p c from  abroad.  As a  consequence,  ur  forecast ows  core PI  staying  etween  2 and  2-1/2  percent o sh C b this  ear nd  next. ut  I  remain  concerned hat  f  rowth  does  not low  as  predicted,  e ffects y a B t i g s th e

of  even  tighter bor  arkets ill egin  to  show through o  higher  ages and  inflation la m w b t w expectations d  ultimately    higher rice  nflation.  ank you. an to p i Th

With  respect  o  the ational  conomy,  real  DP  growth  may indeed ave  slowed  to t n e G h a 1-1/2  percent  ate, e igure  ou  gave  us  earlier,  ke,  with nventory  ccumulation  lowing rom r th f y Mi i a s f the  rapid ace  in he irst arter  nd  net xports  ontinuing  eteriorate.  t  it  eems  to  me, p t f qu a e c tod Bu s and  I  guess  'm ust  epeating me things  hat  thers  ave  said,  hat  hese  wo  negative  mpulses I j r so t o h t t t i on  real DP  growth  clearly  hould e  temporary. ith  that  n ind,  it s ard or e to  see  why G s b W i m i h f m the  negative  ffects  f hese wo factors  ould  be  powerful nough  to  reduce he rowth  of eal e o t t w e t g r final  omestic urchases  y  3  percentage  oints  n he  second alf  f  1998 and  by  roughly n d p b p i t h o a additional rcentage  oint ext  year s  projected, lding  he  average rowth  in eal DP pe p n a ho t g r G below  2  percent  or he ext ix onsecutive  uarters. e labor arkets re  still  traordinarily f t n s c q Th m a ex tight, d  the reenbook  is rojecting ly  a  small eduction  n  the rowth  of mployment in  the an G p on r i g e near erm.

Turning  to he ational  utlook,  he ncoming  data f he  last  ew weeks have t n o t i o t f confirmed he nderlying  trength  f omestic emand. So far,  e see  little  idence f  slowing t u s o d d w ev o in  consumption  and  fixed nvestment, d  labor  arkets  are  still ry ight.  s at he revious i an m ve t A t p meeting, ur  forecast   slowing rowth  hinges n substantial  clines  n nventory  nvestment o of g o de i i i and  deterioration  net xports  n  the ear erm.  Certainly,  e pril usiness  nventory  ata i e i n t th A b i d show some slowdown in  accumulation  elative    the irst arter, t e still  y see  higher r to f qu bu w ma growth  in tocks han  the reenbook  projects. though  we are omewhat more optimistic s t G Al s on net xports  han he reenbook,  we recognize  hat  he isks  ere re  great. e t t G t t r h a

My  recent  rip  o apan  only  confirmed y growing  pessimism ver he  prospects  or t t J m o t f the  quick nd  significant uctural  forms eeded  to  improve  their  conomy. It as painfully a s r re n e w reminiscent  f y days  as  a  trade  egotiator ck  in  the arly 990s.  All old  espite  hese o m n ba e 1 t d t considerations, think hat  eal DP  growth  is ikely  o  exceed  3 percent, d  we forecast we t r G l t an 1999 growth  at  or lightly  ove  trend.  e  are ess ptimistic out uture  nflation  an  the s ab W l o ab f i th Greenbook.

In  my judgment,  he isks  e face ave  increased  n  both he pside nd  the  downside t r w h o t u a since ur  last  eeting. omestic  demand has  not  slowed  appreciably,  d  wage and  price ata o m D an d show some deterioration. the  other and, he  situation    Asia  and  in apan  in  particular On h t in J seems  to  be  more serious  han ust    few weeks ago. On balance,  espite  y  increased  oncerns t j a d m c regarding  sia,    believe  he isks  e face emain  on  the pside. A I t r w r u

There  have  been  some significant  velopments n  the g  markets ecently,  d  I de i a r an thought   would  touch  on  that  or   few minutes. verall,  he gricultural uation   eakening I f a O t a sit isw as  farm  prices  ontinue  o ag.  The  District's  ortant  heat  harvest  s ell  under ay and  a c t s imp w i w w large  rop  is xpected,  lthough bout  10  percent  maller  han he umper crop hat  e had  last c e a a s t t b t w year.  In  addition, cently  lanted  pring  rops re  well stablished  d  are njoying xcellent re p s c a e an e e growing  conditions.  amping the  farm  outlook,  owever, re  low  farm  prices.  heat,  soybean, D h a W and  pork  prices  re unning ore than 5 percent  elow  levels  f   year  ago.  Corn  prices  re a r m 2 b o a a down about  12  percent.  art f he roblem  stems  from  the rop  in  demand from  Asia.  heat P o t p d W exports  o sia  have  been  especially  ak,  contributing    the ow  hog  and  cattle ices  nd t A we to l pr a widespread  losses  n  the  first lf  f his  ear. he  weakness  also esults om  prospects  or i ha o t y T r fr f large  upplies  f oth  crops nd  livestock  is  ear. f eather atterns  re ormal  this  ummer, s o b a th y I w p a n s crop  inventories  ll uild  or he  second traight  ar.  If  hese ow  prices  ersist   the utures wi b f t s ye t l p as f markets  currently ggest,  e expect hat  arm  income in he ation ill all  bout  5 percent.  n su w t f t n w f a I our  District  ere  livestock  ore important, rm  income  could  drop  as  much as  10  percent. wh ism fa In  real  erms,  arm  incomes  are liding   near he owest evels  n  this  ecade. t f s to t l l i d

Lower farm  incomes  will,    believe, ad o  some rise  n  farm  loan roblems  this  ear. I le t i p y However,  most  banks  had  strong  ortfolios  ming  into he ear  and  should e  able  to bsorb p co t y b a likely  ncreases   delinquencies. reover,  rising rmland alues nd  strong  ash ents i in Mo fa v a c r continue  o  indicate at  any farmers till  ve  strong  alance heets.  n  a  more  positive te, t th m s ha b s O no of  course,  he eak farm  prices  ill  oderate  any  upward pressures   food  prices. t w w m on

On the  national  ront,  think rivate  omestic emand is undamentally  trong. ven f I p d d f s E though  domestic emand growth  may slow  over he  forecast rizon,    believe  hat  t  ill emain d t ho I t i w r at r  even  above  the ong-run  rend.  he  first-quarter  ision ggests  hat  he conomy carried o l t T rev su t t e

over  more momentum than  previously timated, d  so  far he  second-quarter  nsumption  data es an t co support  hat iew.  Even though  the xpansion hould low  this  ear ue  to  the xpected t v e s s y d e inventory  orrection d  the  worsening  of he  trade  eficit,  hink  he  slowing ill ot eep  real c an t d I  t t w n k GDP  from  growing  above  the ong-run  rend.   recognize  hat  nventories  d  the ecline  n et l t I t i an d i n exports  re   significant  sk  o he xpansion. a a ri t t e

Recent  developments n the nflation  ont  ave  caused e to  revise  pward  my o i fr h m u inflation  pectations r he ear. he increase  n  core nflation   have  seen  so  far  his  ear s ex fo t y T i i we t y i larger  onth-over-month han   had  anticipated. lso xpect nflation    increase  urther xt m t I I  a e i to f ne year,  erhaps s  past avorable  nflation  ctors wind. While  I  remain  reluctant    draw strong p a f i fa un to implications r nflation  om  the  labor  arkets,    don't  hink  e can  ignore he pward fo i fr m I t w t u movement in  wage gains rising  rom  very ight  abor  arkets. n  addition,  are  seeing a f t l m I we a divergence  etween  growth  in  domestic emand and  growth  in  GDP.  To the xtent  n b d e a accommodative  monetary  policy  ay be  generating e  strong  omestic emand,  I  think  e m th d d w should orry  a  little  out  inflationary sequences. w ab con

Finally, e  continued  trong rowth  in  the onetary  aggregates,   and  M3, suggests th s g m M2 to  me that  onetary  conditions ve  become more accommodative.  Having  said his,  am m ha t I aware  that  avorable  ffsetting  ctors ntinue  o  exert  oderating nfluences.  ipeline f o fa co t m i P pressures  re  small;  apacity  tilization   been  declining; d  the ollar,  ourse,  s nd  has a c u has an d ofc i a been  appreciating.    addition, e istorically  h  real ederal  unds ate ppears o  be In th h hig f f r a t consistent  th  a  slower xpansion. wi e

I  weigh  all his  nd  balance t  ut  as  follows:  he expansion ecently s  shown signs t a i o T r ha of  slowing o  a  more moderate  pace, ut   expect t o  continue  rowing  above  its  ong-run rend t b I i t g l t for t  least  he oreseeable ture.  lso, s  temporary avorable  actors  nwind,  I  think  nflation a t f fu A a f f u i

is  likely  ick p  later  his  ear.   see  evidence ccumulating  o  suggest  hat  onetary  policy top u t y I a t t m has  become more accommodative.  As a  result,  ere s   risk  hat  nflation  ll ise  ore than th i a t i wi r m what  I ould  be  comfortable  ith.  However,  I  recognize  hat  he ata elating  he  extent  f w w t t d r tot o this isk  emain  mixed, nd  I  also m aware  of he nfolding  vents n  Asia.  So,   look orward r r a a t u e i I f to  our olicy  iscussion  omorrow. p d t

As I  look t  the ational  nd  international nomies, he ord  that  omes  to  my mind a n a eco t w c is uncertainty." hink hat  he  forecast,    presented  n  the xcellent aff art how, is  a " I  t t t as i e st Ch S perfectly asonable  ne  and  one  that    sincerely pe  will aterialize,  pecially  e re o I ho m es th international ect f  it.  owever,  the  downside  risk n  the  international e s ery sp o H o sid i v considerable   my view. The situation    Japan  impresses  e as  one  in  which the conomic in in m e data o  not ell  s  the ature  f he risis. at we are  dealing  ith n  the econd  largest d t u n o t c Wh w i s economy of  the  world  is   very  deep  cultural isis    which  the ecisionmaking  rocess  f he a cr in d p o t society, ich had  served apan  very  well  since he eiji estoration  nd  especially nce he wh J t M R a si t

During  our ecent  rip  o  Japan  Deputy  Treasury ecretary  ummers  and  I  found  that r t t S S leadership r  he apanese ation ould  now have  to  come from  the argest litical  rty, e fo t J n w l po pa th LDP.  This  is  a  rather  ignificant ft   the ay that  ociety  un, nd  one  has  to  hope  that  he s shi in w s isr a t shift  ill  ork  well.  In  my view, he  emerging  decisionmakers  n he DP probably ave  a w w t i t L h window of pportunity  f bout  two  to  three  onths  in  which  to onvince he arty embers and o o a m c t p m other olitical  cisionmakers  o ake ome very  difficult ps  s  regards  he  restructuring he p de t t s ste a t of  t Japanese conomy,  especially  e  financial ctor.  here  is   real uestion  oncerning  hether e th se T a q c w they  will e  able o  do  that. b t

If hey  do  not--that  , f  he apanese eople ontinue  o  have  very  low  confidence  t t is i t J p c t a both  the onsumer  and  business  evels  nd  if  hat  oesn't rn round n  the ext wo  to hree c l a t d tu a i n t t months--I  hink hat  apan  will ink nto   deeper ecession.  hat  inevitably ll ause   much t t J s i a r T wi c a more serious  risis sewhere n  Asia, argely  ecause he  situation    Japan  would add  to he c el i l b t in t crisis   confidence  n  an  area here  confidence  s lready  bysmally ow. It s ery  difficult of i w i a a l i v to imagine  that  he ffects  ould  not  spread o he ey  countries   Latin merica.  We  have  seen t e w t t k in A that  ven  Chile as  become vulnerable d  has  had  to  change  policies   very  long tanding, e h an of s which  they hought ad  served hem  very  well. e  have  a  crisis at  s t  an  advanced  stage  n t h t W th i a i Russia,  nd  it ould eadily  pread o ussia's ighbors.  Turkey  is lways  an accident  hat a c r s t R ne a t could  easily ppen. In  my view  that  ort  f nternational ancial  isis uld  not e  limited ha s o i fin cr wo b to  an  Asian  trade  ffect  f,  ay,  /2  or 3/4  percent  n  U.

difficult  imagine hat  hat ould  not  spill er  into ur  financial rkets  and  create    rather to t t w ov o ma a large orrection. c

Looking  at he urely omestic conomy,  if  he risis at    believe  ould manate t p d e t c th I c e from  Japan  does  occur,  he ownside  risk  o  our  real  conomy will e  very onsiderable.  n t d t e b c Ifo the  other  and  a  crisis  apan  does  not appen, he  other  reat  ncertainty   hether  we will h inJ h t g u isw continue  o ave  the  kind f roductivity  owth  that  s rojected   the reenbook.

The significant  terioration he  foreign  conomic  outlook  s he ost  important de i t e i t m change  in he  forecast nce he ay  meeting. In  thinking  bout he ffect  f he  Asian  crisis t si t M a t e o t on the  outlook,  like  o eep  in ind  both  the entral  endency n  forecasts  he pillover    the I t k m c t i oft s on U.S.  economy and  the  probability  stribution ociated th  this  ffect.  n  my view,  the entral di ass wi e I c tendency as relatively  able  arlier    the ear  while he robability     significantly  se w st e in y t p ofa wor outcome appeared o  diminish hen some rebound  occurred  n  the urrency nd  equity  arkets t w i c a m of  the ountries   question.  ore recently,  wever,  there  as  been  both  a worsening n  the c in M ho h i central  endency nd  a  renewal  of   higher  robability     significantly se  outcome.  The t a a p ofa wor aggravation  f  the entral  endency einforces e  case or   significant  owing n  the ace  of he o c t r th f a sl i p t economic  expansion oing  forward,  hile  the  widening  of he ail  ssociated th  worse  case g w t t a wi scenarios  dds  an  important  ownside  risk  o  the orecast. e list   countries cing  erious a d t f Th of fa s difficulties  ms  to  grow by  the ay. see d

Nevertheless,  e  growth  of omestic inal  emand remains obust.  he strength th d f d r T reflects  sitive  undamentals,  ncluding  ontinued  upportive  inancial rket onditions.  his po f i c s f ma c T leaves ome serious  oubt  about hether  the  slowdown that  learly  ppears o e  under  way will s d w c a t b leave rowth  persistently ow trend,    consideration  at  s entral  o  the  optimistic flation g bel a th i c t in scenario  n  the reenbook. While  I  expect lower rowth  and  higher  nflation  ing  forward, i G s g i go still    question  s he egree o  which  this  urns  ut  to e  a  relatively  nign utcome-in i t d t t o b be o specifically, verse  oft  anding  ith  inflation  maining odest--or    less  leasant  nding  of a  re s l w re m a p e

Without  an  impending  slowdown,  we clearly  ould  be  tempted r  required  y  any w o b serious  conomic  analysis   use  the  only ool e have  to  slow  the xpansion own. But  we are e to t w e d saved  by  a  forecast at hows  the  growth  rate  ropping ike    rock nder  the ombined  impact h s d l a u c of  inventory  etrenchment  nd  the  worsening sian  crisis. ,  we have  to  hope  that  he r a A So t Greenbook  is ight  r  at  least  oughly ight  nd  that  he lowdown will ccur r  indeed as r o r r a t s o o h already  ccurred.    certainly  ree hat  he vidence oints  o  slowing,  ut  I  am skeptical out o I ag t t e p t b ab the reak  being s  sharp s  the taff lieves.  y  guess s hat  e will e  back  in  August  with  a b a a s be M i t w b domestic conomy that  s unning   bit  aster  han e think t ustainably  n  and  with  more e i r a f t w i s ca signs f omestic nflation. m not  too  worried bout  that  ecause  I  think he  dollar so s o d i I  a a b t al i likely  o  stay trong  nd  that  he nti-inflationary tia   urrently  very  potent  orce. y that t s a t a iner isc a f B I  mean that  he ow  inflation  pectations d  the  pervasive  elief  f he  business  ommunity t l ex an b o t c that  hey ave  no pricing  ower  because arket  conditions e  so  competitive  re  keeping t h p m ar a inflation    check. in

If he orecast   substantially ng and  growth  does  not  slow  much, then  we really t f is wro have  a  difficult blem.  The problem  arises imarily  ecause  in  some respects  t  least  e are pro pr b a w not ust  he entral  ank  of he nited  States.  e  are  an  institution h  world  responsibilities, j t c b t U W wit whether  we like t r ot.

Of  course,  here s lso he ossibility sed  y several  round  the able  hat  he t i a t p rai b a t t t Greenbook is  wrong in  the ther  irection.  he sharp lowing ould ut nvestor d  consumer o d T s c c i an confidence. he stock arket  could  turn o ational nexuberance nd  we would  be  faced ith T m t r no a w a  soft  conomy and  rising  nemployment.

It eems  to  me that  or he nited tates  o  embark  on a  round  of olicy  ightening s f t U S t p t right  ow could e  very  destabilizing m  an  international ndpoint. w  do  we position n b fro sta Ho policy n  view  of his  ifurcation? e Federal eserve  creates  olicy bviously  n he ational i t b Th R p o i t n interest   he nited  States.  ut  the tate  f he orld  around s  is ertainly  rt f hat  ational oft U B s o t w u c pa o t n interest  r bvious easons. n  my judgment,  he recarious  tate  f he orld  economy seems fo o r I t p s o t w to  preclude  ightening   the ommittee  at  this  ime,  r  maybe I  should ust  ay  at his  eeting. t by C t o j s t m The international act  may yet  prove  to e  just  he ight  hing o  offset e ising  ressures  n imp b t r t t th r p i our  domestic conomy,  and  we may indeed et he reenbook's oft  anding  cenario.    hope  so. e g t G s l s I But  I  have  to ay  that    do  increasingly  ar  hat  t he nd  of he ay  we may have  to  pay  a  high s I fe t a t e t d price or elay. f d

Similarly,  th  respect  o  the lowdown in  inventory  ccumulation,    think 'm n  the wi t s a I I i same camp as  President  inehan. Inventory-to-shipment ios  n  manufacturing  ave  edged  up M rat i h only  slightly,   they emain  below  where  they ere  in anuary. holesale  inventory-to-sales and r w J W ratios  lso eem  to  be  quite  ell ehaved.

Finally, e  staff   looking orward o ome slowdown in  PCE due  to  a  slowing n th is f t s i wealth  creation  rom  the  stock arket  and  a  slight tick  n nemployment.

There  are,  s  others  ave  indicated,  me countervailing  d  potentially  owing  risks a h so an gr on  the ownside.  The strike  t M,  I  think,  s ikely  o xert   short-term t oticeable ock. d a G i l t e a bu n sh The  international elopments  that  thers  ave  talked  bout re  certainly    less ertain.  he dev o h a a no c T one  thing    could dd, fter  oming  back  from  Japan  and  talking  ome private-sector I a a c tos forecasters  ere,  s hat    believe  he ase  forecast at  he taff s  presented  o s  is  somewhat th i t I t b h t s ha t u more optimistic an hose  forecasters   apan  currently lieve.  o,  there  s ome more th t inJ be S i s downside  potential  ere. th

If n his ra a a t i t situation  e conomy is it  ith  a  downward shock  and  policy  s ased nd th e h w i e a if he  economy is  then it  ith  another  ownward  shock  or  policy  ases oo t h w d e t slowly,  he  Federal  pen Market  Committee could  find tself  nstrained t O i co in

its  bility    continue  o upport  he conomy and  the conomy could a to t s t e e worsen  further.

Very briefly  ummarizing  the  results  he aper,  ne  is hat  eing s oft p o t b caught  at   zero  bound  nominal  rate  s robably   very  rare vent. olicy a i p a e P errors  re  one  reason he ommittee could et  caught here,  nd  that  s ore a t C g t a i m likely, viously,  hen the tarting  int s   low  inflation  te. eing ob w s po i a ra B caught  at he ero ominal  bound  could ave  very  serious  onsequences. t z n h c

There  were  two  ways that  he tudy pproached his  ssue.  ne was by t s a t i O looking t  history.  he 1930s  in  the nited tates  rovide ne  example  of a T U S p o monetary  policy  aught t he  zero  nominal  bound, articularly m 1932 c a t p fro through ost  of  the est  f he  1930s.  In  the  1990s, he pproach  of he ero m r o t t a t z nominal  bound  in  Japan  seems  to  have  constrained licy here. po t

The other ay the  study ooked t  this  as through odel simulations. w l a w m There  it  as shown that  itting odel  of  the conomy with  shocks w h a  m e representing expected vents,  he  zero ominal  bound  tended o  present un e t n t problems  and  tended o roduce  longer nd  more frequent  ccasions  hen t p a o w the  economy was producing elow  potential ter  tarting  om  an  inflation b af s fr rate f  1  percent  r  lower. o o

A second  suggestion  f he aper as that  he  Committee  can  structure o t p w t monetary  policy  ctions  o  reduce he dds  of nding p at he  zero ominal a t t o e u t n bound by  being ore aggressive  n  countering  ownside  surprises en m i d wh inflation   lready  ow. Now, this  an  be  seen  to ome extent  n he ne isa l c s i t o place n  the  paper here  the  staff oked t  an  alternative  a  Taylor ule i w lo a to R that  ad  more aggressive  oefficients  that  he ederal pen Market h c so t F O Committee  reacted  ore strongly  o  output  nd  inflation  ps.  That  is m t a ga a symmetrical  ind f  reaction.  ne can  also magine  an asymmetrical k o O i reaction  here  the ommittee  reacts  articularly ongly  o he hreat  f w C p str t t t o deflation en inflation    already  t  a  low  rate. ut  it  s ot asy o wh is a B i n e t implement  such  a  policy.  he  Committee  needs  to dentify  e  surprise, T i th needs  to e  confident  hat  nflation   oving down to  dangerously  ow b t i ism l levels, d  needs  to e  willing   take isks  y  moving aggressively  ainst an b to r b ag deflation   a  potential flationary  ock.  The Committee  needs  to  take he or de sh t risk  hat  f  t s rong,  inflation  ght  re-emerge nd  the ommittee would t i i i w mi a C then  have  to ounter  hat--would ve  to everse  ourse. o  this  symmetric c t ha r c S a strategy quires    willingness  ake isks. re a tot r

A third  onclusion  f he  paper as that  nce  the ommittee  finds c o t w o C itself    the ower ound, ts  ptions  re imited.  iscal  olicy  s robably at l b i o a l F p i p the ost  effective y of  stimulating  e  economy when monetary  policy  s m wa th i trapped y  the  zero ound,  but he entral  ank  cannot ount n  the  fiscal b b t c b c o authorities, e certainly  e  seeing  n  Japan  today. he monetary as  w ar i T authorities  ve  at heir  isposal  ome fiscal-type  tions  hat  hey ould ha t d s ac t t c

Unorthodox  monetary  policy  ay work,  but t bviously  ould  have  to m i o w be  through hannels ther  han  reducing hort-term terest  tes  ince hey c o t s in ra s t are  already  t ero.  Those  channels  ight  include  educing xpected a z m r e short-term  ates  y  tilting  wn long-term  ates,  educing  erm  or  risk r b do r orr t premiums in  long-term  ates.  he latter so ould  tend o educe  long-term r T al w t r rates nd  exchange  rates  s  well. a a

Pumping up  the onetary  base  by itself  uld  be  unlikely  o  be m wo t effective   doing  either  hese hings, at  s,  educing hort-term te in oft t th i r s ra expectations   term  and  risk  remiums. Such  increases  n  the ase  would or p i b tend o  go  into  xcess eserves  nd  there  s o  obvious eason hy that t e r a i n r w would  change  expectations out uture  ates.  ilting en  market ab f r T op operations  o   limited  egree oward  bonds  or oreign  xchange  also s ot t a d t f e i n likely  o o  much.

However,  massive a d d purchases f  bonds  or  massive ntervention  ght.  The Federal eserve  did o i mi R set he  rate  n  government  bonds  during orld  War II. f    central  ank t o W I a b were  willing  o  purchase ll he upply f  government  bonds, t ould et he t a t s o i c s t bond  rate  gain,  nd  presumably his  ould  feed hrough o  corporate a a t w t t borrowing  rates  s  well. o,  there  re xtreme  policies volving  assive a S a e in m purchases hat hould ork in  lowering erm  premiums and  risk  remiums. t s w t p

In  considering  ow low inflation  ould o,  the ero  bound  is nly  one h sh g z o part f  the alculations.  ere  are   number  of  other  otential sts  nd o c Th a p co a benefits.  n the enefits  ide,  he aper id ot  deal t ll ith he xtra O b s t p d n a a w t e growth, roductivity,  efficiency  at  ight  result om  an  economy p or th m fr operating  t ery  low or  even  zero ates  f nflation.  fortunately,    s a v r o i Un it i hard  to uantify  ith  confidence  he  gains rom  going o  zero nflation q w t f t i or the  costs f he  zero ound. o t b

A final  uestion  s hether here re  any  implications  his  nalysis q i w t a oft a for he  Committee's  onsideration  er  the ext  couple f  years. or  one t c ov n o F thing,  here  ould e  a  practical  licy  ssue t ome point. ight ow,  of t c b po i a s R n course,  he unds  rate s t t f i a 5-1/2 percent nd  the isk,   a  number of ou a r as y already  ave  noted,  s or nflation    be  rising. zero  bound  problem  does h i f i to A not  seem to e  in  the ards,  ut t  s ot  impossible  o magine  a  situation b c b i i n t i involving  ower  inflation  d  lower ominal  interest  tes.  e  have  tended l an n ra W to  overpredict flation  er  the ast  ew years.   think  ne  of he essons in ov l f I o t l from  the nited  States  n  the  1930s  and  Japan  in he  1990s  is hat  roblems U i t t p have  tended o  follow harp reaks n  asset  rices  oupled ith  sluggish t s b i p c w

From a  different  rspective,  e ommittee  might  want  to onsider pe th C c whether  it  as  anything seful  o  communicate  to  the ublic bout he h u t p a t long-run ontext  f  its  olicy  ecisions.  f  he ommittee had  a  sense hat t c o p d I t C t i would lean  hard gainst  nflation  tes  hat  ended o  drop  to ery, ery ow a i ra t t t v v l levels  r  to  zero,  here  ight  be  some benefit  rom  laying  ut he ssues  or o t m f o t i f the  public.  t ould allow  markets o nticipate  ch  actions  nd  such I w t a su a anticipation  ght  help o ring own long-term  ates.  ou will emember mi t b d r Y r that  ne  of he roblems n  Japan  in  the arly 990s  and  in he nited tates o t p i e 1 t U S in  the arly 930s  was that  t ook ong-term  ates   long ime  to ome e 1 i t l r a t c down,  presumably  because arkets  were  anticipating t  he  authorities m tha t would  bring ates  ack  up again. f he  Committee  were not oing o  do r b I t g t that,  ight  be  useful  o nform  people. hat  also ould  promote  a  public itm t i T w debate,  nderstanding,  d  accountability   ow the  Federal eserve u an ofh R interpreted  e  price tability dated  in  the ederal eserve  Act. th s man F R

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President rdan. Jo

MR. JORDAN. Thank you. I  think hat  etting  ther nput  n the aper,  f    way can t g o i o p i a be  found  without  reating  ll inds f  problems  for  s, ould  be  very esirable. t  like he c a k o u w d Bu t research  hat  as done  a  couple  of ears  ago  on the osts nd  benefits  educing nflation,  ave t w y c a ofr i I  h a  difficulty h  the  starting  int.  o reduce nflation  om  any  inherited tuation  plies  nitial wit po T i fr si im i conditions  nd  policies at  et n  motion  certain  ynamics  as  opposed  to tarting  om  the a th s i d s fr premise  that  e have  stable  urchasing  ower  of  money. Stable urchasing  ower of oney does w p p p p m not  mean that  he rices  f ll ssets  r  goods  or  services  re  unchanged.  What it  eans is hat t p o a a o a m t the  weighted-average   relevant  rice  ategories  ot  rising  r  falling. of p c isn o

Once we start  rom  that  oncept f  the table  urchasing  ower  of he urrency,  hich f c o s p p t c w is  the dea e are  trying  o  implant  nto he inds  of ecisionmakers--households    businesses i w t i t m d and alike--I  ink  e come out  a  little  fferently.  ppose  that  s ur  initial  ndition  nd  we then th w di Su i o co a

have  a  favorable  roductivity  ock, aybe like he ne  we have  had  in  the  last  ouple f ears. p sh m t o c o y That  means an increase  n  the urchasing  ower  of oney because he eighted  average f rices i p p m t w o p that  re  falling ceeds he  weighted verage f  prices  hat  re ising. ere  is ome literature a ex t a o t a r Th s on this, e  work that  eorge  Selgin nd  others  ave  done  about he roductivity  rm for nflation. th G a h t p no i A couple  of conomists  n  Britain  lso ave  done  some work on  that  ssue.   central nk  can e i a h i A ba conduct  a  monetary  policy  n hat  nvironment hrough   monetary  base  arrangement f upply i t e t a o s and  demand for entral  ank  money. It oes  not reate  roblems  of he ype hat    see  in  this c b d c p t t t I paper  derived  rom  the aylor ramework.  So,  even  if  e consider    Taylor ramework  approach, f T f w a f there s nother r  different  y of pproaching  he  same  question  hat    do  not ee  included  n i a o wa a t t I s i this  aper. p

MR. KOHN. I  think    favorable  roductivity  ock, ven  in  the ontext  f  this  aper, a p sh e c o p would  not resent  he  Committee  with  a  problem  for he easons  hat  ere  discussed  arlier p t t r t w e in this  eeting. Such  a  shock  tends o  raise  he quilibrium al  nterest  te  nd  it  ends o  boost m t t e re i ra a t t growth.  I  think  hat  becomes an  issue  n his  aper s ownward shocks  to emand. w i t p i d d

MR. JORDAN. That  is hy I  referred   initial  nditions.  e  do  not et hat w to co W g t liquidity  ap ffect  here  efforts   increase  he onetary  base nly  add  to xcess eserves tr e w to t m o e r unless e start th  the  initial  ndition  f nadequate  ggregate  emand.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  arry. P

MR. PARRY. I  think  his  s   very nteresting,  ful, d  important  tudy.   would t i a i use an s I agree  that  t  nvolves    very  difficult ject  o  study,  nd  all f s  probably hould pend  a  lot i i a sub t a o u s s

more time  with  it.   think  on Kohn hit  n  most  of he uite  nteresting ues  hat    saw in  the I D o t q i iss t I paper.  I  found  the ne  about aking  ore vigorous r  aggressive  ction    fairly gnificant  int. o t m o a a si po If e are  operating  nder  a  Taylor ule,   guess n  effect  hat  we are nvisioning  hat  e have w u R I i w e ist w higher oefficients the  two  gaps  that  ause  policy  o ove more aggressively.   ay also c on c t m It m cause  policy  o  move in  a  more  preemptive ay,  which  we can  do  even  under   Taylor ule  if t w a R we have  forecasting.  ,  I  think  hat  s nteresting. So t i i

The other nteresting  int elates   what  may be,  at east  n  terms  of hese odels, i po r to l i t m the  advantage f  setting  goal hat  s   little  ove  zero. he  simulations em  to  suggest  hat  f o a t i a ab T se t i we have 1  to  2  percent  nflation    our oal, e would  run  into he ero  bound  constraint  ry i as g w t z ve few times.  Again, his  s n  terms f he  simulations  hose odels, ut  I  think t's uite t i i o t int m b i a  q interesting  sult.  frankly  id  find ome of he  alternative  licy  ptions  nteresting, re I d s t po o i in particular  e put" ption o ring ong-term  nterest  tes  own; perhaps t oes  have  some th " o t b l i ra d i d practical levance  o  real  orld  situations. re t w

I  want  to ake a  couple  of dditional ints, ich  may be  related   some that  ill m a po wh to B Poole  brought p.

But  even  if  2  velocity  gain s  predictable    it  as prior  o  this M isa a as w t decade, t  ay not  be  predictable  ough.

Despite he ncertainty   money demand,  M2  still ems  to  be  of ome t u in se s use  as n  economic  indicator. r  instance, ere  s   strong orrelation a Fo th i a c between  the  growth  of 2  in ne  year nd  the rowth  of ominal  GDP  in M o a g n the  next. nother  example  of  the ndicator lue f 2  is hown in  the A i va o M s lower  panel f hart ,  which  plots  urprises   nominal  GDP  relative    the o C 6 s in to staff  orecast  long ith  surprises    M2  adjusted  or he ffects f a w in f t e of deviations  f he  funds ate  rom  Greenbook assumptions.  he  positive o t r f T correlation  ggests  hat ncoming  data n  M2, which  are  available ll su t i o we before he inal  DP  numbers, ive ome guidance n contemporaneous t f G g s o developments n  nominal  spending. he  Bluebook  provided   similar i T a analysis  f  M3, not hown here,  nd  found  that he orecast rors  or he o s a t f er f t velocity  f  M3  have  been  slightly  rger  han hose or 2, while he o la t t f M t relationship   3  to  GDP  is   little  aker  than hat  or 2. ofM a we t f M

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. I  am somewhat sympathetic  o  President t Parry's  iew,  but   think  his  s   dog  that  s etter ft  ot arking  n  the ight nd  bringing v I t i a i b le n b i n a attention   the anges t his  ime.  We  would  have  a  lot f xplaining  o o  if  e said hat  e to r a t t o e t d w t w were reducing  he ebt ange  to ove even  more in  the  direction  rice tability.  m  not  sure t d r m ofp s I' that pening  up  that  rgument  would  be  very  convincing  r  worth  the  trouble.  he move would o a o T occur  at   time hen most  of s  are  concerned hat,  f  e look urely t he  domestic conomy, a w u t i w p a t e the  likelihood  hat  onetary  policy  ight  have  to e  tightened.    think  iving   signal  hat ist m m b I g a t clearly  ould  be  interpreted    a  weakening  of  monetary  policy  ould  be  a  terrible  ea. w as w id Although  I  sympathize ith  President  arry's ew,  I  believe  e are etter  ff f  e retain  he w P vi w b o i w t present  anges or ll he  aggregates. r f a t

MR. PARRY. I'm  not ure   understand  hat  you  mean by "weakening  of onetary s I w m policy."

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. In  other ords,   would  not hange  the ebt w I c d range  even  though  I  think  ou  probably  re orrect  ntellectually. y a c i

MR.  PARRY. But  if  ou  are educing  he  range,  hat  s he pposite  f eakening. y r t t i t o o w MS.  MINEHAN. He meant  weakening  debt  growth.

MR. PARRY. I  see.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Meyer.

MR. MEYER. Let  me offer  n  alternative  rspective. hink hat  he urrent  rice a pe I  t t t c p stability  terpretation  ows arget  anges or oney growth  to e  set ndependently  f oth  the in all t r f m b i o b current  orecast  nd  projected  olicy  nd  therefore   be  ignored  n  the olicy  rocess. f a p a to i p p

Switching o  a  projections  terpretation  herefore osely  onnected n y view with  a  return t in is t cl c i m of  money growth  to  a  more important  ole n etting netary  policy.  n expanded  role,  s r i s mo A a noted  in he luebook, eed  not e  in  the orm  of  a  rigid  arget th  policy  esponding t B n b f t wi r aggressively    deviations  2  growth  from  its  arget.  ut  an  expanded  role ould  at  least to ofM t B w signal hat  oney growth  would  be  more important  s  an  indicator riable, d  that  eviations t m a va an d of  money growth  from  a  target  ange ould be  one  of  a  number of onsiderations  at  ould r w c th w affect  he  course f onetary  policy. t o m

I  look  forward o  the eturn  o   projections terpretation  he  money growth  ranges t r t a in of  t for wo reasons. irst, elieve  t s ore consistent th  the pirit  he  Humphrey-Hawkins t F I  b i i m wi s oft Act. Second,  I  believe  t ould  increase  ublic wareness f  money growth, nd  this  ould e i w p a o a c b useful  t  times n  explaining e eed  for   change  in  policy.  n  particular,  s  ight  make it a i th n a I thi m easier  o  explain  he eed  for   tightening  onetary  policy  uring   period  hen robust t t n a ofm d a w economic  growth  pushes  money growth  above  its  arget nge. t ra

The staff ports  hat  2 continues  o erform  as  well  relative    its  eterminants  s re t V t p to d a was the ase  before he  deterioration   uch  performance n  the  early 990s.  This rogress c t fs i 1 p report  s imilar  o hat  ade at irtually  ery eeting  at hich  we have  discussed  his  opic i s t t m v ev m w t t during y two  years n  the  Committee.  So,  the uestion  s f  ot ow when?  What additional m o q i i n n hurdles  o  we expect 2  to ump through nd  over  how long  a  period  efore e accord t    new d M j a b w i a role?  In  fact,  he ar  seems  to ave  been  raised. t b h

A second  question  as  been  put  in  the iscussion  he luebook  for his  eeting. h d oft B t m Was velocity  ver table  r  predictable ough  to ustify ore important  ole?  This, f ourse, e s o en j a  m r o c is   relevant  uestion.  y  assessment  s hat  oney growth  did lay  a  useful ole arlier  d  that a q M i t m p r e an it ay,  therefore,    ready o esume  a  somewhat more important  ole oing orward.  greater m be t r r g f A role or oney growth  in  the olicy  rocess ight  be  facilitated  h  by  returning   a f m p p m bot to projections  terpretation he ange  and  by  the dentification    long-run arget  or oney in of  t r i of  a t f m growth  consistent th  the  Committee's nflation  rget.  e  implicitly  entify ch  a  target wi i ta W id su today  as  the idpoint f he urrent  oney growth  ranges,  hich we have  interpreted    being m o t c m w as consistent th  price tability. y  countries ve  either  dopted  an explicit  flation  rget  r wi s Man ha a in ta o have  given  a  more central le o oney growth  in  policy  eliberations, uring  nominal ro t m d ins a anchor  for onetary  policy nd  its  ommunication. m a c

If e decide ot  to  adopt  an  explicit  flation  rget, cording  oney growth  a  more w n in ta ac m important  ole  n  the olicy  rocess nd  establishing ong-run  arget  or oney growth  would r i p p a a l t f m be  a  natural  lternative.    considering e  long-run  arget  or he oney growth  rate  nd  indeed a In th t f t m a in  specifying e  numerical ange  under  the rice  tability erpretation,  ink  e also eed  to th r p s int I  th w n take nto ccount he  analysis  f he  implications   the ero ominal  interest  te ound  we i a t o t of z n ra b discussed  esterday.  he current  rice tability erpretation he oney growth  ranges s et y T p s int of  t m i s with  the idpoint or 2  growth  at   percent, rresponding  o  about m f M 3 co t a 1/2 percent  nflation  te i ra for he  GDP  price  ndex.  If  e decide hat  he ppropriate ng-run  nflation  rget  s rue t i w t t a lo i ta i t inflation  us   cushion,  hen  the ong-run  oney growth  target  or 2  should e  raised. pl a t l m f M b

So what  about  alternatives  I,  nd  III? lternative I  emains nattractive  spite I, I a A II r u de its  onsistency.  t oesn't ke sense o  move to  alternative if  he ltimate  bjective,    in c I d ma t III t u o as my case, s o  move from  the  price  tability   projections  terpretation he anges. i t s oa in of  t r I personally  ready  to  move to  a  projections  terpretation  he anges,  hough  in  this  ase he am in of t r t c t numerical anges n  alternative   hould e  adjusted  o ake them  consistent  th  a  FOMC r i IIs b t m wi consensus orecast. e staff,  wever,  does  not ave  the  necessary  nformation   make the f Th ho h i to adjustment  ecause hey eed  the OMC's  projections   short-term terest  tes  s  well  as b t n F of in ra a nominal  income.

Let  me suggest    few possibilities.  st,   ight  be  appropriate r he  Chairman  to a Fir it m fo t note  in is pcoming  Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony  hat  he  Committee  is oving toward h u t t m paying  somewhat closer  ttention  oney growth, f here  s ome agreement ere  that  hat  s a tom i t i s h t i the  case.  Second, erhaps e could  ask he taff   adjust  he lternative  ranges o  make them p w t s to t a II t more consistent  th  the  Committee's  orecast  nd  for hem  to hink ore about ow to wi f a t t m h accomplish  this.  hird,  erhaps e should etain  he lternative  anges t his  eeting  but eep T p w r t a I  r a t m k

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Kelley.

MR. KELLEY. Mr.  Chairman,   also ould  not  make a  change  now in  the anges or I w r f either  f he wo  time eriods.  n  the ase  of he econd  half  f 998,  I  agree ith  President o t t p I c t s o 1 w Minehan that  he  Humphrey-Hawkins  Act  primarily  ocuses n what  the ommittee  plans or he t f o C f t aggregates.  hat  implies  hat  e are etting rselves    benchmark.  To change  the anges n  the T t w s ou a r i middle  of he ear  would be  to  destroy  he alue  of hat  enchmark  and  fuzz p  the easons  hy t y t v t b u r w it  as adopted.  In  the ase f aking a  change  for he ear head  six onths  in  advance, w c o m t y a m a reason  for oing  that  ight  be  that  he ommittee  wanted  to  signal    major  change  that  as d m t C a w ahead.  And we may--I  emphasize  may--have  a  candidate  or uch  a  change  here  if  e want  to f s w send  a  signal  hat  he ggregates  re ow much more on the  front  urner han hey ave  been. t t a a n b t t h But  I  would  say  that  f  uch  a  signal  s esired,   ight  be  better proached y  developing  ome i s i d itm ap b s kind  of nformation lease  nd  having  the ommittee  debate t  nd  perhaps dopt t,  ather  han i re a C i a a i r t simply  changing he anges  at his  eeting.   think    change  at his  oint ould rove  to  be t r t m I a t p c p counterproductive.

For  the oment, the  data hat  e have  still  dicate  hat  nit  osts  re ising   a  very m t w in t u c a r at modest  rate. nit  labor osts  ave  picked p some,  and  productivity  ins ay be  accelerating. U c h u ga m Indeed, hat  s hat  the ata or onfinancial rporations  ow,  but ompensation er  hour  also t i w d f n co sh c p is  accelerating.   I  said t  the ast  eeting,    have  some  questions  bout  how much confidence As a l m I a we can  place n  the xtraordinarily ign  behavior  f  the CI as  an  indicator  nderlying o e ben o E ofu trends  n  labor  osts.  he  ECI  is o  doubt easuring hat  it s upposed o  measure, amely, he i c T n m w i s t n t wage structure stracting  om  the  movement of eople  into  ifferent  b lassifications.    it ab fr p d jo c But is ard  for e to  believe  hat  n  today's ry ight  abor arkets here  re ot  numerous  phony h m t i ve t l m t a n promotions or urposes f iving ay  increases   selected  ndividuals thin ompanies, hich f p o g p to i wi c w would be  politically ficult  r mployers  to  give irectly. t, hat  ort f  pay  increase dif fo e d Ye t s o obviously  ill ot how up  in  a  change  in  the CI.

Nonetheless,    think  t  s afe o rgue hat  rice ressures,  ile odestly I i i s t a t p p wh m accelerating,   not y  any  means overwhelming. e  have  been  using he  core PI as  our are b W t C standard.    seriously estion  hether hat  s  the ight  tatistic  hat  urpose. irst  f  all,  he I qu w t i r s fort p F o t increases  n  the ore PI  over he  last  hree  onths  have  averaged bout .6  percent  t n  annual i c C t t m a 2 a a rate.  hat  is qual o  the ate  e had  in  1996. On a  methodologically nsistent  sis, e T e t r w co ba th average  increase  s loser  o  3  percent. f, wever,  we look  at he  core CE, which  is   far ore i c t I ho t P a m sophisticated  y of  evaluating at  prices  eally  re oing, he verage or he hree onths  is wa wh r a d t a f t t m still der  2 percent  r  below  where  it  as in  1996. I o  not ave  the ethodologically un o w d h m

It s omewhat higher,  bviously, t  it  s nu m i s o bu i nowhere  near he  level  hat  ives ise  o  the ype f oncern  created  y  a  focus n  the ecent t t g r t t o c b o r acceleration    the ore PI.

The big  rally  hat  e have  had  in he  yen  and b tot f ma t w t the  Nikkei  was mainly  an  end-of-quarter  lly  s  of une  30.  Today,  when the ikkei ally ra a J N r resumed,   think  he arkets  indicated at  hey  are xpecting  ar ore out  of he  announcement I t m th t e f m t on July  than  is ikely  o e  there. herefore, e  notion,  hich  I  think s he ingle  iggest 2 l t b T th w i t s b problem, hat  he  Japanese overnment  and  its  eading  arty annot et  their  ct ogether uld t t g l p c g a t co be on  us  rather  uickly  ndeed. q i

Nevertheless,  ch a a b i t h t w su productivity  owth  is till t  as  rapid s  the rowth  of emand,  and  that reates  he roblem gr s no a g d c t p that  e have.  I  also m delighted th  the nemployment rate  eing  at .3  percent,  nd  I  hope  it w a wi u b 4 a continues  o o down. I  would  like  o  see  it  o  to   percent  r  even  below 4  percent.  ow t g t g 4 o L unemployment helps s  to  do  wonderful hings  y  providing  pportunities  r eople. ut  it  lso u t b o fo p B a sets   model  for he est  f he  world  about hat  works.  The longer  e can  sustain ,  he ore a t r o t w w it t m imitators ound  the orld  we are oing  to  have. So,  I  hope  we will ot et urselves  nto ar w g n g o i a situation  ere  we have  to ake ction. n unavoidable  yproduct ould be  a  higher wh t a A b w unemployment rate.  t ould  be  not nly  bad  for s, ut  also ad  as  a  model for he est  f he I w o u b b t r o t world  if  e found  ourselves  aced ith  having o  take uch  an  action. w f w t s

When  I  look  at he sian  situation, haps atin merica,  and  certainly ssia, t A per L A Ru I think e should  ease  policy.  nfortunately,   do  not  have  the uxury f ven  considering at w U we l o e th option t his  ime, nd  that  s oo  bad.  Maybe  if  ominal  spending rowth, oney  growth, nd a t t a i t n g m a other hings  ver he  last  ear ad  been  as  forecast   the taff stead  f  coming  in  stronger,  e t o t y h by s in o th economy might  be  more balanced ight  ow and  we might  be  able o  entertain at  ossibility. r n t th p Or  maybe if  e had  responded arlier   indications  at pending rowth, omestic emand,  and w e to th s g d d money and  credit  rowth  were  coming  in  a  lot  tronger  nd  the urrent  ccount eficit s g s a c a d wa widening, e might  have  had  the ption f onsidering  n  easing ooner.   think  e are  going  to w o o c a s I w need  to  ease or  he ake  of he est  f  the orld.  The sooner e create  he onditions thin he f t s t r o w w t c wi t domestic  economy that ill ermit s  to  contemplate  n  easing f olicy,  he etter  ff e are w p u a o p t b o w going  to e  and  the etter  ff  he orld  is  going o  be.  Unfortunately,   sometimes  have  to b b o t w t we tack; e sometimes  have  to  go  in  an  opposite  irection om  where  we really  ant  to  go  to  get w d fr w there.  I  want  to  be  in   world here  we not nly  have  lower  inflation,  here  we have  lower a w o butw interest  tes,  apid  conomic  growth, nd  sustained  ow  unemployment. But  I  think  e are ra r e a l w approaching    point  here  we may have  to  go  in  a  direction fferent  om  where  we all ant  to a w di fr w come out.

We  have  forecasted r in t i g d e a slowdown,  and  we are  seeing    slowdown.

MR.  POOLE. My  concern  is hat  eeting  after  eeting  we are rifting  to   situation t m m d in a that  ill ccommodate higher nflation  xt  year  and  the  year fter.  et  me start th  an w a i ne a L wi assumption  about he olicy  nvironment  hat  e are  going o  be  facing ver he  next ew t p e t w t o t f meetings hrough he  rest f his  ear. he inflation  te  ver  the emainder f his  ear s lmost t t o t y T ra o r o t y i a completely  redetermined.  e  don't  now what  it's  ing  to  be, ut  whatever t  s,  t  s ot p W k go b i i i i n going  to  be  much affected  y  what  we do  at his  eeting r he ext. owever,  what  happens  to b t m o t n H the  inflation  te  s oing  to ake a  difference  he  environment ithin hich  we are aking ra i g m tot w w m our  policy ecisions. d

I  am also uite  repared  o  assume that  ur xternal  roblems  or  the roblems n  other q p t o e p p i economies  are  very  likely   be  with  us, nd  I  fear  hey ill  e  with  us  for    long ime.  Consider to a t w b a t two  different enarios  or ur oming meetings. irst, ppose  that  he ublished  PI  inflation sc f o c F su t p C rate  emains  low.  That  will  ake life  asy  for s.

It s  not bvious o  me that    tightening ve now is  going o  make the ituation i o t a mo t s in Japan  worse.  What I  believe  he apanese eed  to  do  is o ave  a  consistent  licy  irection    a t J n t h po d on number of  fronts, cluding    monetary  policy  hat  s ore  expansionary  o  end  their  eflation. in a t i m t d Such a  policy  n  Japan  is ikely  ead o  some further preciation  he  yen  against  he  dollar, i l tol t de oft t and  that  s   constraint  at  he apanese eel  n art  ecause f .S.  pressures. f  n i a th t J f i p b o U I a appreciation   the ollar  gainst  he  yen  is ttributed   olicy  ction  ere,  t  ay actually ke of d a t a top a h i m ma the  situation  sier  or apan.

Lastly,    have  some sympathy  for hat  Bob McTeer said bout  returning   a I w a to symmetric  directive. ave  been  mulling ver hat  ption,  ut  in  the nd  I  rejected   ecause, I  h o t o b e it b while  it ight  be  consistent th  our urrent  hinking, sically ded  uncertainty   hat  might m wi c t ba ad isw lead  us  to  ymmetry and  until  e know or  think  e understand    little  re about he conomic s w w a mo t e situation,  ould  not ant  to  attract tention  he  symmetry  issue.  t s o  some extent  he I  w w at tot I i t t same issue  e talked  bout his  orning  with  regard o he anges or he onetary  aggregates. w a t m t t r f t m So,  I  m for itting  ill  th  the symmetric  directive,  t   did ive ome thought o  the dea f a s st wi a bu I g s t i o shifting   symmetry  that  ob McTeer raised.  hank you. to B T

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Mr.  Kohn, would  you  lead s  off? u

MR.  KOHN. Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  At  the eeting  in arch, m M several  embers suggested hat  he  Committee consider  hether ome m t t w s explanation  hould e  given  to he  public fter  ach  meeting hen no s b t a e w change  is ade in  monetary  policy. wo proposals  ere  put n  the  table  t m T w o a the  March meeting. One was to  release  he  directive  en the ilt  s t wh t wa changed  along ith  a  brief  xplanation.  nother as to  release    brief w e A w a statement  fter  very eeting  whether  or  not he ilt  s  changed.  Dave a e m t t wa Lindsey  and  I  came up  with  a  number of ermutations  nd  combinations  f p a o those roposals. p

The desire  or ore explanation  omes from  within he ommittee. f m c t C There  is o  real utside  ressure  or ore or  earlier  lease  f nformation. n o p f m re o i Committee  members from  time  to  time  have  wanted  to xplain  he asis  or e t b f a  "no  change"  decision, tably  hen markets xpected    change  that  id no w e a d not  occur.  Some members also ndicated  hat  hey hought n  explanation i t t t a was desirable en the  Committee felt  hat nderlying  onditions re wh t u c we

shifting gnificantly  ugh  not nough  to  warrant   change  in  policy. hat si tho e a T was the  case n  March. There  also as  been  a  desire  t imes o arn i h a t t w markets  that    change  might  be  forthcoming  n rder o educe he dds  on a i o t r t o an  overreaction cause  of  the  surprise en policy  ightening    easing be wh t or actually  ccurred. t ay also e  that  he elt  eed  to ssue    statement  hen o I m b t f n i a w no  change  is ade is ed  in art  y  the  limited  umber  of ctual  hanges. m f p b n a c The Committee  has  few opportunities    comment on  policy  onsiderations to c outside  he  two  Humphrey-Hawkins  testimonies ch  year. t ea

The question  f ow much to  announce  and  how often o  do  so  has o h t been  addressed  y  the ommittee  on  a  number  of ccasions, st  recently b C o mo in  February f  1995.  At  that  ime he ommittee  had  a  report  rom  a o t t C f subcommittee eaded  by  Governor  Blinder, th  Governor  Kelley, h wi President  oehne,  and  President lzer  as  members. The subcommittee B Me recommended and  the  Committee  accepted hat  essentially  the urrent w is c policy  f  announcing hanges  in  the  stance  f olicy.  hat  subcommittee o c o p T recommendation  included  he  possibility n  occasional  xplanation  f  a t of  a e o "no  change"  in  policy f  here  as  a  good  reason o rovide uch  an i t w t p s explanation, t  it as expected o e  rare. he possibility  an  occasional bu w t b T of public tatement  o  explain    "no  change"  policy  ecision  as announced  to s t a d w the  public  t he  time.  The  Committee  has  shied way from  using hat a t a t option artly  n  the round  that  embers felt  t ould  be  difficult  do  so p o g m i w to just  nce  in  a  while. aving  done  it,  here  ould  be  pressures r nd o H t w fo a expectations   more frequent  nnouncements. of a

No one  at he  February 995 meeting  was  in  favor f aking an t 1 o m announcement  after  very  meeting,  lthough    think lan  Blinder  eaned n e a I A l i that  irection.  ore than hree  ears ave  passed ince hen,  nd  the d M t y h s t a Committee has  had  more experience  ith  announcing hanges, o  it  eems w c s s appropriate  or he ommittee  to  reconsider s  olicy. f t C it p

In  its  iscussions   these  ssues  n he  past,  he ommittee  has d of i i t t C weighed  two  broad  considerations.  re  I  am drawing n the ebruary He o F 1995 discussion  s  well s  Dave Lindsey's mo  and  other nformation  hat a a me i t we have.  On the  one  hand, roviding  ore rather  han  less  nformation  s p m t i i viewed  as  generally  etter blic  olicy. t s he esponsibility   public b pu p I i t r of  a agency  to xplain  ts  ctivities  a  democratic  ociety, d  it  nhances e i a in s an e accountability    that  gency. In  addition,   average nd  over ime, of a on a t markets  should ork  better  f  hey nderstand  hat  the ommittee  is w i t u w C thinking  bout  and  what  its  oncerns re.  That  is,  hanges n  market  prices a c a c i should  tend o  stabilize  e conomy and  help  the ommittee  to  achieve ts t th e C i goals.   think  here  re wo  caveats  ere. irst,    s ot  always  easy or he I t a t h F it i n f t Committee  to  convey  its  ntentions  d  concerns. hey are ubject  o i an T s t misinterpretation, ainly   experience  e all ave  had  from  time o ime. cert an w h t t Second,  volatility  increase  f  vents o  not alidate  xpectations. may i e d v e Moreover,  Committee  statements  elp o  frame  press eporting  nd  press h t r a

coverage f  policy  nd  hopefully   educate he ublic  n  that  ay. o a to t p i w Committee  statements  r  official  leases ve  you,  the embers of he o re gi m t Committee,  some guidance n  your  own statements er  intermeeting i ov periods.  hose  are  the ositive pects. T p as

On the  other  and, he  Committee has  anticipated  awbacks  to  making h t dr additional nouncements  and  releasing  dditional formation,  pecially an a in es if those  announcements  and  information  eed ack  on  the olicy  rocess tself, f b p p i making  it  ore difficult each  the ight  ecision.  n  some of he m tor r d I t discussions er  the  years,  he arket  reaction self  s viewed  as  a ov t m it wa potential oblem  as  well  as  a  benefit.  he  reasoning  as  that  f  he pr T w i t Committee  wanted  to ove interest  tes,  ould  change  policy.  he  fact m ra it w T that  t ad  not  changed  policy  uggested  hat  t  id ot hink  onditions  ere i h s t i d n t c w right  or hanging  interest  tes.  n  1995 in  particular,  eral  ommittee f c ra I sev C members expressed  oncern  that  he nnouncement  itself  uld ock  in c t a co l market  expectations d  reduce lexibility  ause  it  ould  set p  situations an f bec w u in  which  the arket  expected ome action nd  the ommittee  would  then m s a C have  to orry  about isappointing  ose xpectations. w d th e

One question  aised  t  the ime  was whether nnouncing  a  "no  change" r a t a decision  ould  make it ore difficult  implement  intermeeting anges, w m to ch including  elayed ontingent  hanges.  In  the  past,  he ommittee  has  from d c c t C time  to ime  made decisions   meetings o  change  its  olicy  tance n he t at t p s i t next ew days  or  weeks after  he eetings f  he  data ame in  a  certain y. f t m i t c wa I  can  recall  decision  ike  hat  n  December 1991. The  Committee  did ot a l t i n want  to  announce  a  "no  change"  decision  nd  then ot e  able o  make a a n b t change  within he ext ew weeks if  he ncoming  data ere  of  a  certain t n f t i w kind.  That  is hy  the urrent  nnouncement  after  ach  meeting s hrased w c a e i p "there  s o  further nouncement"  rather  han  "the ommittee  has  not i n an t C changed  its  olicy." p

The Committee  also as concerned hat nnouncing  symmetries nd w t a a asymmetries  could e  seen  as  a  precommitment  not  only ver he b o t intermeeting riod ut  for he  next eeting  as  well. f  he  directive re pe b t m I t we released,  e ymmetries  and  asymmetries ould  be  much more th s w consequential,  rtly  ecause  of arket  reactions.  hat  prospect  ould pa b m T c provoke  more dissents d  could ead o educed se  of he  symmetries nd an l t r u t a asymmetries  because  members would  be  concerned bout he  market a t reactions.  embers commented at  that  ime  that  he ilts  d  contributed M t t t ha to policy  lexibility    consensus uilding, d  they ere  concerned bout f and b an w a doing  something hat  ould  reduce he se  of he ilts   he  policy  rocess. t w t u t t int p

There  also as  concern  about he ording  of he ress tatement. w t w t p s Members anticipated  fficulties eaching  greement  or  consensus, di in  r a especially   tatements  ere  forward-looking   had  implications r uture if s w or fo f action.  t as not  clear  hat  to  do  about  dissents   contrary  iews  in he I w w or v t

announcements.  These  are  problems  that  rise  or tatements  ade when a f s m the  Committee  actually anges  its  olicy. ut  some of he  thinking  as ch p B t w that  ith  no  action,  here  as nothing o ake he ocus ff  he ords w t w t t t f o t w themselves,  nd  the ords  might  be  more important  or   statement  bout a w f a a why the  Committee  did ot ake ction,  hich  would  be  examined  more for n t a w what  it mplied  or he uture  han  for   statement  hat  xplained  omething i f t f t a t e s the  Committee  had  done.  At  the  March meeting,   number  of  you  were a concerned hat  he uances  of   "no  change"  directive th  a  tilt   change t t n a wi or in  the ilt  uld ot  be  captured  n  a  short tatement. t co n i s

In  addition  o  these ros nd  cons, here  re   number  of ther ssues t p a t a a o i that  ou  could hink bout n  the  process  f eaching  his  ecision  r hat y t a i o r t d o t would need  to  be  thought  bout f  our  disclosure licy  ere  going  to a i y po w change.  One question  s hether here re  ways of ccomplishing  he i w t a a t objective  f xplaining    "no  change"  decision  ther  han aking an o e a o t m announcement  after  very eeting.  One possibility iously  ould  be  to e m obv w implement  the ebruary  1995 decision  o  issue  he ccasional  are F t t o r statement.

If he  directive  eleased, ould inutes  be  speeded  up  to  help t isr sh m explain  he  directive? en if  hey ere  speeded  up,  the inutes ould  still t Ev t w m w be  released  ith  a  lag fter  he irective,  t  at east ey ould  help o w a t d bu l th w t explain  he  Committee's ecision  ith  a  shorter  ag. nd should he t d w l A t directive  rding  be  looked  at gain?  The  Committee did  look  at irective wo a d wording  on  the  tilts    ugust  of  1997, ust  bout   year  ago, nd  you  were inA j a a a unable  to each  a  consensus n  any  changes.  Another ssue  s ow to  treat r o i i h dissents d  alternative  ews. an vi

A further  oncern ight  be  whether hese ssues  hould e  considered c m t i s b in  the roader ontext  f nteractions   OMC b c o i ofF members and  staff th  the wi public nd  the ress. ou have  discussed  hat  is ppropriate d  what  is a p Y w a an not  appropriate  ell  utsiders,  t  the  guidelines main  informal.  he tot o bu re T question  s,  hould hey e  codified  r  at east  iscussed  gain? i s t b o l d a

Finally,  here  s  a change  in rocedures, w should his  e ift i p ho t b announced  to  the  public? f  ou were  to  change  something  today,  he I y t Chairman's  umphrey-Hawkins testimony  ould  be  a  natural  ossibility. H w p Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.

MR. BOEHNE. This  is   topic hat  as  been  the asis  or    lot  f iscussion om  time a t h b f a o d fr to  time,  nd  I  hink  t  s orthwhile  o  bring  t ack  and  discuss  t  gain ecause ircumstances a t i i w t i b i a b c

I  believe  ost  of s  around he able  tart th   bias oward  giving  he ublic  ore m u t t s wi a t t p m information.  ut  I  think  here  re  two  basic easons hy we should ot nd  up  disclosing  e ilt B t a r w n e th t or  regularly king  statements  hen we do not hange  policy.  hey come down in  my view  to ma w c T the  quality  f he nformation  hat  e would  be  releasing d  the uality  f he eliberations  at o t i t w an q o t d th we have  around  the able. t

I  think  t  s eneficial   give he ublic   lot  f nformation out onetary  policy, i i b to t p a o i ab m and  we do  give he  public    lot. ut  giving isinformation  armful. s an  illustration, t a B m ish A one only  needs  to ook  at he mbiguity hat  urrounds  he ilt. rkets  do  not ave  a  clear l t a t s t t Ma h understanding  f  what  we mean by  our  "woulds"  and "mights."  For  example, ome analysts y o s sa that  he  asymmetry  toward ightening at  he  Committee  adopted n  March means members t t th t i agree  that    rate  ike s ore likely  han   rate  ut. thers  say  the symmetry  means members a h i m t a c O a agree  that  heir  ext ove will e  to  raise  ates, ough he  timing s p in he  air. et  another t n m b r th t i u t Y group  says  the symmetry  was meant  to repare he  markets o  give he  Committee  room to  act a p t t t at  today's  eeting  or he  May  meeting.  I  recall alysts plaining  ot oo  many years go  that m t an ex n t a an asymmetric  directive ant  that  he  Committee  had  given he hairman leeway  to  change me t t C rates  etween  FOMC b meetings,  hile ymmetry meant  the  Committee  had  decided o  tie  he w s t t Chairman's ands.  This  ambiguity s ot  terribly  portant  hen the ilt    old ews,  but  I h i n im w t is n believe mbiguity bout  the eaning  of symmetry  in  a  current  irective ants  he eeds f a a m a d pl t s o considerable  onfusion. c

Then the  issue  s hether  we could lear  p  this  mbiguity.  The  problem  is hat  t  s i w c u a t i i hard  to  clarify e mbiguity or he  public  hen we are ot  clear  bout he eaning of th a f t w n a t m

asymmetry  among ourselves. he reason s hat t  as  meant  different  ings  o  different T i t i h th t Committee  members in  different  rcumstances.  n  that  ind  of ituation,  e ask f rafting ci I k s th t o c an explanation  hat  oes  not islead s t  best   challenging e  and  the ikely  utcome  is hat  he t d m i a a on l o t t effort  ill  nd  up  being n  exercise  n  frustration    one  that  ill roduce oilerplate. w e a i or w p b

The second  reason or ot  increasing e  amount  of isclosure  ts  ffect  n  the f n th d isi e o quality  f he eliberations.  icker nd  more complete  disclosure ready  as  changed  the o t d Qu a al h nature f  the ommittee's  eliberations.  m for he isclosure at  e do,  but  we should ot o C d I  a t d th w n mislead urselves  bout  how it  as  changed  the  nature f hese  roceedings.    recall o a h o t p I participating outine, gorous,  nd  freewheeling  ebates n  this  oom before e decided o in  r vi a d i r w t release  ranscripts. ,  most  of  us  read repared emarks bout ur  Districts  d  the  national t Now p r a o an economy and  even  our  comments on  near-term  olicy  ometimes  are rafted  n  advance. p s c i Prepared tatements  ere  the  rare xception  ather  han he ule ntil  e started   release s w e r t t r u w to transcripts.

So the ssue s ow early elease  f he  tilt ll hange  the ature f  our eliberations. i i h r o t wi c n o d I  think t  ill. nnouncing the ilt  he  current  irective timately  ll ead s  to  avoid i w A t oft d ul wi l u asymmetry  altogether. hink hat  ill liminate    consensus-building  ol hat  as  benefited  ur I  t t w e a to t h o decisionmaking  rocess nd  has  helped void  the  hardening f  positions. nouncing  the ilt p a a o An t of the  current  irective en we have  not  decided o  change  policy mmediately  nevitably  ll d wh t i i wi invite  ore speculation d  even  lobbying f  individuals  out  the iming f ur ext  move. I m an o ab t o o n suspect  hat  ver  time   majority  f he ommittee  will evelop  a  preference  or ymmetric t o a o t C d f s directives  st  o  avoid hese  inds  of nnouncement  effects. ju t t k a

In  most  cases hen the  Committee  has  adopted n asymmetric irective,    as  voted w a d it h for o  immediate  change  in  policy. here  have  been  a  few  times hen the  Committee  has n T w

adopted  an  asymmetric  directive  ong  with  a  25 basis  oint  hange  in he ederal  unds ate. al p c t f f r But  in ost  cases,  erhaps ll,  he symmetric  directive lped uild    larger  ajority  or m p a t a he b a m f consensus.   think  onsensus s seful, rticularly, e discussed  ast  ight t he .K. I c i u pa as  w l n a t U embassy  dinner,  ecause hat  has  evolved s   collective  sponsibility    accountability b w i a re and for this  ommittee  rather  han he ndividual sponsibility  t  as  developed n ngland.  I  had  the C t t i re tha h i E sense  last  ight hat  hey ished  they ere  closer  o s  than here  they re  now. n t t w w t u w a

I  think e send  a  louder, ronger  essage  when we do  change  the unds ate  f  e have w st m f r i w this  onsensus-building, lective-accountability ach.  If e do not  have  the symmetry c col appro w a available   part f  our irectives,  hink  e will ee  more 8  to  4  votes nd  7 to  5 votes. s hat as o d I  t w s a I t bad? Maybe not.  But  when I  came away from  the  discussion st  ight,   ensed hat  e are la n Is t w better  ff  he ay we do  things  ere. o t w h

The  bottom  line s hat  eleasing e ilt   the urrent  irective  ot ikely  o  give  the i t r th t in c d isn l t public uch useful nformation  bout  monetary  policy, t  it  s  likely   reduce he uality m i a bu i to t q of our  deliberations  d  our bility    build    consensus. an a to a

That  leads o  the ssue  f eleasing  statement  fter l eetings n  which  we do not t i o r a a al m i change  the xisting licy tance  ut  without dentifying  e  tilt    the irective. elieve  uch  a e po s b i th in d I  b s statement  ould  fairly ickly ead o emands to  identify e ilt.  e  cannot void aking the w qu l t d th t W a m tilt own for ery  long  if  e start   make regular  nnouncements.  What would  happen  if  e kn v w o a w did  not nnounce  the ilt  hat  utside  bservers  ould  pore  over very ord in he a t ist o o w e w t announcement  in  an  effort  etermine  hether  there  s   tilt    not.  So,  I  think  he wo  go tod w i a or t t together.

I  personally lieve  hat  e have  found  about he ight  alance or ow between  the be t w t r b f n public's  ght  o  know and  the ublic's  terest    having  a  high-quality  cisionmaking  rocess ri t p in in de p

In  the are xceptions  hen we might  want  to rovide ome information  bout he t r e w p s a t tilt d  our  policy  irection   to repare he  markets or   near-term  olicy  hange,   think  e an d or p t f a p c I w have  ample  vehicles  o o  that  hat  re onsistent  th  our ollective  countability,  ably  he t d t a c wi c ac not t voice  of he hairman. t C

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That  was a  very  thoughtful aluation d  historical ev an review.  On the asis f y own experience,  come out  at he  same place.   have  gone around b o m I t I and  around  on  this  ssue  nd  I  keep  ending p  in he ame spot or xactly  he easons  d Boehne i a u t s f e t r E mentioned.  Governor  Kelley.

MR.  KELLEY. Mr.  Chairman,  I  strongly  gree ith  President ehne,  and  between a w Bo what  you and  he  just  aid,  ou  have  preempted he  substance  f he tatement  hat    wanted  to s y t o t s t I make. But  if  ou will ndulge e,  I  would  like o o ahead  and  try o xpand  on  what  Ed y i m t g t e Boehne said.

I  did it  n  that  arlier bcommittee,  s  Don mentioned,  nd  I  strongly  upported  he s o e su a a s t changes  that  e adopted  in  early 995. But  I  would  have  a  very  strong  oncern bout aking w 1 c a m further  hanges  such  as  those hat  re  discussed   the indsey aper. here  is   presumption,  f c t a in L p T a o course,  hat  nformation  eleased  bout he  activities  a  public ody  is asically  good  thing, t i r a t of b b a and  I  would  concur ith  that  iew  if  he nformation ets  two  criteria.  e  first  hat  t  ill w v t i me Th ist i w be  useful  nd  helpful  o  society, d  in  this  ase   think  e are alking  bout he arket  and  its a t an c I w t a t m participants  d  balancing  n  a  positive y the eneficial d  potentially mful ffects  hat an i wa b an har e t may exist  rom  that  erspective. e second  criterion  uld  be  that  here  e  no  negative  mpacts f p Th wo t b i on  our  critical  licymaking rocesses,    Ed Boehne suggested,  r  that  olicy's  tended  esult po p as o p in r is ot  outweighed y  the  benefits   an  earlier lease.  n  my view,  the  notion  ere o elease n b of re I h t r

immediately ails   both  of hose riteria.  t  me comment on  both  of hem.  Before   do,  I f on t c Le t I would  like  o  make a  few points. t

My  first int s ebatable, t  I  believe  hat  f  e start king  regular po i d bu t i w ma announcements, e will ery  soon  find urselves  ocked nto oing t  ll  he ime  whether  we w v o l i d i a t t like t  r ot.  Be that  s  it  ay,  I  would  like  o all  our  attention   he tatistics  able  1 n i o n a m t c y tot s in  T o page  12 of ave Lindsey's  aper.  That  table  ecords  52 decisions. hey include  9 decisions D p r 1 T 6 to  change  policy  nd  83 decisions t o  change.  The table  lso hows  the ilts  at  xisted  t he a no t a s t th e a t time  those ecisions  ere  made. I  am considering mmetry  to  be  a  tilt    this  nalysis. ghty d w sy in a Ei of  those ecisions  ere  accurately retold   the  existing lt   the ime  that  hey ere  made. d w fo by ti at t t w That  is 2.6 ercent f he otal.  eventy-two ere  inaccurately  retold  y  the xisting lt, 5 p o t t S w fo b e ti or 47.4  percent.  hat  is ot   very mpressive  uideline  o uture  ecisions.    think  hat  s ood T n a i g t f d I t i g news and  bad  news. The good  news  is hat  t learly ows  that  he OMC t i c sh t F is  always  looking  t a incoming  data ith  an  open  mind and  is ot  being  trapped  y  any  previous entiment.  he bad w n b s T news is  that  hile mmediate  release  ould  obviously  eveal  hat  the OMC w i w r w F members were thinking  s  a  group  at he ime  of   meeting,  he  tilt   ery lose o eing erfectly rthless  s  a a t t a t isv c t b p wo a predictor   what  the OMC of F will n  fact  o. Fifty-fifty  ld  be  perfectly rthless  n his i d wou wo i t analysis.

As for he  two  criteria,  irst s  to  do  with  the et mpact  on  society  nd  how it t thef ha n i a appears o he  market.  What would  be  the ossible  bjectives  he  earlier  lease? he  first t t p o oft re T might  be  a  better derstanding  f he ederal eserve  on  average ver  time,  s  Don Kohn says un o t F R o a on page  4  of is emo. h m To be  sure,  chieving  hat  bjective   highly  esirable,  t   don't a t o is d bu I think t  ecessarily  s  anything  o  do  with  early  elease  f he  directive.    fact,   I  hope  to i n ha t r o t In as show momentarily,  arly  elease  ctually uld be  counterproductive    that  bjective. th e r a wo to o Wi

respect  o  the arket's  unctioning,  membering  this  2.6 o  47.4 naccuracy  plit,  e arket t m f re 5 t i s th m professionals  o watch  the ed closely  ill mmediately now those acts.  hey  will earn wh F w i k f T l nothing hat  hey  do  not lready  now, and  they re  going o  continue  o  do  their  wn analysis t t a k a t t o and  act ccordingly.  n  the  case f he  general  ublic,  believe  hat  hey ould  very  soon a I o t p I t t w become quite isillusioned h  the  lack f ollow-through at  hey ould  perceive, cause d wit o f th t w be they  are ust  oing  to  look t ur  actions; ey re ot oing  to  study he easoning  nd  the j g a o th a n g t r a carefully afted  anguage n  our eleases.    personally ve  no  doubt  whatsoever hat  hose cr l i r I ha t t unfulfilled ts  uld  harm the  credibility  this  ommittee to he ublic. ould it amp til wo of C t p W d volatility?  on't  hink o  because n  the  short  erm, he ilt  s  no forecasting  wer.  The I  d t s i t t t ha po speculators uld  respond ith  a  "ho  hum" and  perhaps eed he  information rginally  nto wo w f t ma i their  ssessments. heir dds  on  the  direction  he  next olicy  hange  might  shift    little, a T o oft p c a but the  volatility he arket  would  continue  s  speculation ntinued. int m a co

I  would  have  a  concern hat  mmediate  releases uld  leave s  wide  open  to olitical t i wo u p demagoguery  by persons nown to  all f s.  Take this  7.4 ercent f he  time hen the k o u 4 p o t w operative  ilt   ot ollowed.   can  hear t  ight  ow,  "the ed  is isleading  he ublic," he ed t isn f I i r n F m t p "t F is  manipulating  he arket,"  the ed  is ndecisive,"  he ed  has  no  integrity,"   so  forth. t m " F i "t F and When  we announce  a  tilt  ward  tightening,   will et n  incessant umbeat ntil  hat  ets to we g a dr u t g settled e  way or  the  other.  f e eventually   not  act,  hen hose ho engage  in  demagogic on I w do t t w rhetoric ll ay  that  hey  forced s  to  back  down. If  e do  act o  tighten,   will et he ame wi s t u w t we g t s rhetoric  get  now. If e announce  a  tilt    ease,  he  demagogic  rhetoric  oing o  ask  us  why we w to t isg t we are  hesitating,  we are  dithering;  e  easing learly  esirable;   learly  s eeded; ou why th c isd it c i n y are  already  ate.  hen,  if  e do  ease,  hey ill laim o  have  forced  s  to ase, ut  that  e l T w t w c t u e b w should  have  eased y b 50 basis  oints, t 5,  and  we were  too  late  nyway. p no 2 a

That  brings  e to  criterion  mber  two. To release  nformation  s ood  unless  t m nu i i g i affects  he olicymaking  rocess nd  its  esults   a seriously rverse  anner,  and  I  think  t t p p a r in pe m i would  do  that  n hree  ays. Two  of hem  have  already  een  mentioned. he first  hat  his i t w t b T ist t Committee  would in  my view  lose redibility  h  the eneral  ublic,  nd  that  ould  weaken our c wit g p a w ability    conduct n  effective netary  policy.  econdly,   think  he olitical  magoguery to a mo S I t p de would  be  dangerous n  the ense hat  t  ould  be  very ard or s  to  ignore.  he worst ut ot i s t i w h f u T b n unlikely  esult  ould  be  that  t ome point  e might  feel bliged  o  assert  ur  independence  nd r w a s w o t o a act n  a  way that  ould  be  harsh nd  perhaps remature. i w a p

Thirdly,  s  Ed  Boehne said   minute  ago,  I  think  hat  ur ymmetric/asymmetric a a t o s convention  as  been  very seful.  t epressurizes certainty.   egitimizes  certainty d  it h u I d un Itl un an legitimizes  lay hen delay s  appropriate.   elps uild    consensus.   think  hat  egular de w i It h b a I t r announcements  would  ultimately  use  us  to  lose he se  of hat  ery seful  onvention.  f  he ca t u t v u c I t FOMC wants  to  change  policy, en t oes  so  and  if  t  ants  to  decide n  "no  change  plus th i d i w o a tilt,"  en hat hould e  the esult. t  if  e were  immediately  o  announce  the ilt thout th t s b r Bu w t t wi a policy  ove,  it  s ery  likely  n y view  that  he  announcement  would  move the arket t east m i v i m t m a l some of  the ime,  ossibly  he quivalent  bout  one-half    policy  ove or aybe more,  but t p t e ofa a m m sometimes  the arket  would  not eact  t ll. e  would  never now. As we sat ere  and  voted, m r a a W k h knowing  that  he ilt  s going  to  be  released,  would  not e  able o nticipate  th  any t t wa we b t a wi degree f ertainty at  the  effect  ould  be  on  the  market.  That  would  create  he  likelihood o c wh w t of an  unintended  nd  unpredictable  licy  hange.  I  believe  hat  fter  hat  appened  a  couple f a po c t a t h o times,  e would  feel  urned  and  we would  very  soon  cease o se  the ymmetric/asymmetric w b t u s convention.    think  hat  ould  be  a  very  important  oss n   couple f ays. It ould  frequently I t w l i a o w w force he  Committee  into iming ecisions  n a  basis  hat  t ould  not therwise  hoose  and  that t t d o t i w o c

might  be  unwise. Secondly, gain  as  Ed Boehne said,    think  t  ould  remove a  very seful  nd a I i w u a legitimate nsensus-building  ol. co to

I  do  not hink  t  s ny  accident  hat  here  s o  other  entral  ank  of ignificance t i i a t t i n c b s anywhere  that  ses  such  an  immediate  release.  n  my opinion,  e should ot  do  it ither.  think u I w n e I we have  it  ight  t his  oint.  et  us  not ry o ix t. r a t p L t t f i

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  roaddus. B

MR. BROADDUS. Mr.  Chairman,  I  am going espectfully  take he pposite  iew r to t o v from  that  upported  y  Ed  Boehne and  Mike Kelley.  Incidentally, uld  like  o  thank ave s b I  wo t D Lindsey  for  is emorandum h m that    think aid  ut he hoices ell,  specially e oadmap.  That I l o t c w e th r was a  huge  help,  or e anyway. f m

I  believe  ny  consideration   his  uestion f hether e should isclose  he  tilt a oft q o w w d t immediately  eeds  to  start   asking hether  the ilt  seful  n  general n  our  deliberations, n by w t isu i i whether  it  s eleased  r ot.  I  believe  t  s. n  my view, he eed  to  consider  he ilt  nguage i r o n i i I t n t t la forces  he ommittee  to  keep  in loser  ouch  with  its  onsensus nd  to pecify  t  ore precisely t C c t c a s i m at  any  point  n ime.  As I  see  t, at  acilitates   aking  imely  olicy  ctions.  t lso llows i t i th f ourt t p a I a a the  Committee  collectively  d  as  individual mbers to  express   concern r  an  expectation an me a o on one  side r he  other  f eutrality  thout ecessarily  voring  n  immediate  change  in  the o t o n wi n fa a federal  unds  rate.  t oes  not lways  work that  ay with  me in  practice,  t ertainly   an  in f I d a w bu c it c principle.

The fact  hat  he  tilt  nguage s seful  oes  not ecessarily  an that  eleasing t t la i u d n me r it immediately ould  facilitate   implementation  f olicy.  ut  my own view  is hat  oing  so w the o p B t d would be  constructive,   I  would  cite  hree  ain reasons or hat  iew. These  have  already and t m f t v been  alluded  o.  First,  all now that  arkets o  not  like  urprises,  d  in y view  they ork t we k m d s an m w

better  hen they  are  not  surprised. leasing he  tilt mediately  ould  keep  the arkets  better w Re t im w m informed  and  better prised  f he  direction    which we are  most  likely   move over ime  and ap o t in to t in  that  ay help etter epare arkets  for mpending  changes. w b pr m i

Second,  it  eems  to e that  he  same  principle at  uided ur  decision  ack  in s m t th g o b February f  1994  to egin  disclosing anges  in he unds ate  arget  mmediately s pplicable o b ch t f r t i i a here.  As I  understood  t  hen, he rinciple s that  reater  ransparency s  better  han ess i t t p wa g t wa t l transparency  nless  here ere  clearly gative  onsequences f  greater ansparency r ur u t w ne c o tr fo o deliberative  ocess.   respect  he iffering inion hat  as  been  expressed,  ut  I  am not pr I t d op t h b convinced hat his  rocedure ould  necessarily  ve  a  negative  ffect  n  our eliberations. t t p w ha e o d In fact,  think  e can  make an  argument  that  t  ight  enhance  them  under ome circumstances. I w i m s I think ike Kelley's  oint bout eing  demagogued is  a  good  one, ut  on  the ther ide f hat, M p a b b o s o t immediate  release  ould  reduce he  problem  of eaks.   think  t  lso ould  reduce ur w t l I i a w o vulnerability he  politically y  sensitive  arge  of ecrecy,  r  excessive  ecrecy. o me,  that to  t ver ch s o s T is ne  of he  most  serious  harges hat  an  be  leveled  gainst  he entral  ank  in his  ociety. o t c t c a t c b t s Immediate  announcement  of  the ilt  uld  work  to educe hat  roblem. t wo r t p

Finally, mediate  disclosure   the ilt uld  enable arkets  and  the ublic enerally im of t wo m p g to  interpret  coming  data gainst  he ackground  of uller owledge  of he ed's  urrent in a t b f kn t F c position,  en  recognizing  hat  ur  position ght  change.  For  example, tronger-than-expected ev t o mi s data oming  in  after  isclosure   an  upside ilt uld  be  more likely  roduce  a  reaction c d of t wo top in markets  that ould  cause  long-term  nterest  tes  o  rise    little  d  in hat  ay enhance  the ole w i ra t a an t w r that  ong-term  nterest  tes  an  play s  automatic tabilizers  he conomy. l i ra c a s fort e

If he  Committee  accepts  hat  osition,    I  do, he ext ssue  s ow we would t t p as t n i i h implement  it.  y  own preference  ould  be  to  release  he perating  aragraph f he irective M w t o p o t d

after  very eeting.  We  all now the  language s ot xactly  hakespeare,  ut t  s hat  we in e m k i n e S b i i w fact  se  to xplain  ur ecisions  fter  ach  meeting nd  to onvey  those ecisions   the esk.  If u e o d a e a c d to D we are  going o ontinue o  do  that,  do  not  see  any  compelling  eason or ithholding  hat t c t I r f w t information  rom  the ublic.   also o  not  see  any  reason o elease  nything eyond  the f p I d t r a b operating  aragraph--the her  anguage n  the irective.    think  t  ould  make sense,  r. p ot l i d I i w M Chairman,  to ontinue  o  rely n  your  testimonies d  speeches o  convey  the ommittee's c t o an t C broader hinking  bout nderlying  conomic  developments hat  ondition  ur ecisions. t a u e t c o d

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  arry. P

MR. PARRY. I  had  a  question  or  on Kohn before aking a  comment. Don,  you f D m referred  o ccasions  hen we did  not  change  policy  ut aw a  possibility t  e would  do  so  in t o w b s ha w the  next eek or  so  after  he  meeting epending n  the  incoming  data. ow  did hat  ffect  ur w t d o H t a o wording  of he  directive?  o you  recall? t D

MR. KOHN. No,  I  don't  ecall actly.    believe  he ommittee  adopted   very trong r ex I t C a s asymmetrical ilt. m thinking  f  December 1991 when the iscount  ate  as cut y  a  full t I  a o d r w b percentage  oint nd  the  federal  unds ate as cut y  1/2  percentage  oint  ess  han   week after p a f r w b p l t a that  ecember meeting.  The  members left  he  meeting ith  a  strong  resumption hat  hey D t w p t t wanted  to et   package  of asing ctions  ogether at  ncluded  oth  the  discount  ate  nd  the g a e a t th i b r a federal  unds ate.  hink here  as a  strong ilt    presumption n  that irective,  t   don't f r It t w t or i d bu I remember the xact  language. e

MR. PARRY. I  cannot emember either. t  me make a  few comments. There  have r Le been  some interesting  ints  ade with  regard  o easons hy we might  not ant  to  announce po m t r w w changes  in  the ilt.  t  I  believe  here re ome advantages o  making  an  announcement  when t Bu t a s t we change  the ilt    well s  when we change  the unds  rate  tself. nouncing  decisions t as a f i An

concerning  he ilt uld  in  my view  provide dditional formation  o he arkets  that  ould t t wo a in t t m w enable hem to  function  ore efficiently. have  talked  n  the  past bout onditioning  e t m We i a c th markets. his  is   very  effective ol or oing hat. therwise,  e sometimes  have  to  depend T a to f d t O w on  the iming f estimony  r  speeches hat  re oing  to e given y  the hairman.  This s t o t o t a g b b C i a simple ay to  accomplish he  same thing. w t

I  also hink  hese nnouncements  would  cut own on  leaks. e  have  had  problems t t a d W with  leaks ssociated th  the  tilt.  nouncing changes  in  the atter  uld  make the ecisions  o a wi An l wo d t change  it  ore meaningful ecause n  effect  he ilt  uld  become an  additional strument m b i t t wo in of policy.    see  that  s  a  good  thing, t   bad  thing  s  Governor  Kelley mplied.  here  are imes I a no a a i T t when there oes  not  seem to  be  agreement r   clear  onsensus bout  what  a  particular  cision d o a c a de about  the ilt tually ans. That  is bvious. t eems  to  me that  aking a  public t ac me o I s m announcement  would  require  ore  clarity thin he  Committee  as  to hat  it eans,  and  that m wi t w m could  be  a  positive velopment. de

I  also elieve  hat  n occasion he vailability n unannounced  tilt  s  provided b t o t a of  a ha a way for s  to efer aking tough  decisions out  policy  ctions  hat hould e  taken.   do  worry u d m ab a t s b I a  little  at    policy  f egular  nnouncements ould ause s  not o se  the ilt,   it  oesn't th a o r a c c u t u t but d have  to urn ut hat ay. One approach  that    have  been  thinking  bout  is hat  he t o t w I a t t announcement  could  actually   the  entire  irective  ther  han ust  he  operating ragraph,  ut be d ra t j t pa b I  haven't  hought nough  about hat.  t eems  to e that  he ull  irective,  ile  it  ay not e t e t I s m t f d wh m b Shakespeare,  rovides    little  re information  hat  ould  be  of  interest    the arkets. p a mo t w to m

MR. STERN.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. Let  me start  y  saying hat  I  am not  in b w favor f.   am not  in  favor  f eleasing e ilt,   full  irective,    the perating ragraph f o I o r th t the d or o pa o the  directive. elieve  here  robably s ore noise han alue n  doing  any  of he bove. I  b t p i m t v i t a Having  said hat,  do  think  hat  ncreased  isclosure d  increased  ommunication  have  served t I t i d an c us  well  on  balance ver he ears.  I  do  not onclude hat  e have  somehow, or  at east  'm ot o t y c t w l I n entirely nvinced hat  e have  somehow, stumbled nto ptimality re  [laughter] d  are  doing co t w i o he an just  he ight  hing.  o,  I  am giving  hought o hat  we can  do  incrementally,  at  I  would t r t S t t w wh describe  s  another  mall  step oward roviding  dditional  formation. a s t p a in

What I  am attracted  ,  nd  I hink  his  omes largely  rom  the iscussion  had  a to a t t c f d we meeting  or  two  ago, ould  be  a  statement  f ur  thinking  fter  very eeting. or  the ost  part, w o o a e m F m this  tatement  ould  be  retrospective her  han rospective,  t t  ould  help o xplain hy s w rat t p bu i w t e w we came out  where  we did  not nly n  the ases here  we changed  policy  ut lso here  we did o i c w b a w not  change  policy.  s Don Kohn already  as  suggested,  rafting mething  like  hat  s robably A h d so t i p not  going  to e  easy.  On the ther  and, hose f s  at he eserve  Banks all ave  some b o h t o u t R h experience  ith  that  hen we communicate  the iscount  ate iscussion d  decision  f  our w w d r d an o boards  to he oard  of overnors.  So,  I  don't  iew  that  s  an  entirely possible  ask.   do t B G v a im t I think t  ould  be  another mall tep oward  improving  communication.  My judgment  is hat  t i w s s t t i would  be  received  ell  in he arketplace  nd  elsewhere  nd  would help eople nderstand w t m a a p u what  we are  thinking  bout,  hat  we are  concerned bout,  nd  some of  the  difficult deoffs at a w a a tra th Governor  Rivlin eferred . r to

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I  want  to omment on  that  riefly. hink  t  s ar asier c b I  t i i f e to  write   statement  hen we are aking  ction  ecause  we have  a  majority  f he embers who a w t a b o t m favor  he  policy  ove,  presumably argely  or he ame reasons. t s ery  difficult  agree n a t m l f t s I i v to o statement  hen we are  not  taking  ction. n  other  ords, o  try o  capture  n  a  statement  he w a I w t t i t reasons hy people re  not  doing  something  is n  my view  far ore  difficult n  stating y w a i m tha wh certain  hings  ere  done.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  oole. P

MR.  POOLE. When  I  try o hink  hrough his  ssue,    start th  three lements. e t t t t i I wi e W have  policy  ecisions;  have  a  policy  ationale  at  e try  o  convey  to  the arkets;  nd  we d we r th w t m a have  the nternal licy ebate.   think t  s  very  important  hat  he nternal licy  ebate e  kept i po d I i i t t i po d b confidential    that  e can  have  a  complete nd  free  xchange. so w a e

In  terms f he olicy  ecisions, elieve  hey  should e  disclosed  romptly o he o t p d I  b t b p t t market  in  part  o void eaks nd  in  part o rovide he learest  ssible  irection  arket t a l a t p t c po d tom participants  d  to  avoid he roblem  of ifferent  rket  participants  th  different  sitions an t p d ma wi po getting  nformation  t ifferent  mes. n  the ast,  efore he unds  rate  ecision  as announced i a d ti I p b t f d w

after  very eeting, ome market  participants,    experts, t  the nformation  irst,  d  I  do  not e m s the go i f an think  hat  s   wise  way to perate. t i a o

In  terms f he  rationale,  ully  rticulated ionale   mpossible.  e  are  never o t a  f a rat isi W going  to gree  on  exactly  hy we do  things.  We  all ome out  in  somewhat different  rections. a w c di The rationale at  s ncorporated   the  directive  ery, ery  general. t  s ostly oilerplate. th i i in isv v I i m b I don't  nderstand  he  difficulty   eleasing e  full  irective cause t  s lmost ll  oilerplate, u t ofr th d be i i a a b and  it  s   very inimal  common i a m ground  that  e can  agree n.  So,  I  would  be  in avor  f w o f o releasing e  directive.  cannot magine hat elease  ould  cause s  any  grief. th I i t r w u

The issue  hen omes down to  the uestion  f hether  the  tilt     policy  ecision  r t c q o w isa d o not.  If t  s ot   policy  ecision,   eems  to  me that  t  oes  not elong n he  directive   ll i i n a d its i d b i t ata because  the irective     statement  f hat  we are elling e pen Market  Desk to  do  and  the d isa o w t th O underlying  ationale r hat.    think  he ilt uld e  used  constructively onvey  our  sense f r fo t I t t co b toc o the alance f isks, e  likely  uture  irection   our  policy  ecisions.  believe  hat  s he  point b o r th f d of d I t i t that  ob Parry as making.

In  terms f he  suggestion  hat  ary Stern  ade about roviding  ome information o t t G m p s after  ach  meeting,    thought bout hat, o.

Let  me also aise  ne  other ssue.  n intermediate ep e might  consider  aking r o i A st w t would  be  to elease  he inutes lightly  fore nstead  f  slightly  ter  he ollowing  eeting.  I r t m s be i o af t f m asked  about his  t  the inner ast  ight.  he Bank of ngland, s  you  know,  is onsidering at t a d l n T E a c th possibility.

I  think  he inutes ould e  moderately  ewritten. is  is ifficult  do i n t m t m c b r Th d to in  periods  hen we are  tightening. en  we are  easing,  e are  heroes nd  nobody cares uch. w Wh w a m When  we are  tightening,    s ard  to  do,  but n  that  ircumstance    see  a  lot f dvantage o it i h i c I o a t giving   warning  before e do  the  deed.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Meyer.

MR. MEYER. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. I  think e already  ave  had  some very w h thoughtful  iscussion  f his  opic.   will ry o dd  incrementally    that  f   an.  I elieve  e d o t t I t t a to i Ic b w have  an  opportunity   take nother  mall tep oward  greater ansparency.   elieve  uch  a to a s s t tr Ib s move would  be  constructive  cause he dditional formation  ould  help  participants he be t a in w int financial rkets  to  better  nderstand  he  FOMC's  assessment f isks.  his ould  allow  the ma u t o r T w FOMC to  better  repare he ublic or hanges  in olicy  hat  ight  lie  head. p t p f c p t m a

Let  me comment on  three ssues.  irst, ould e change  the nnouncement  policy? i F sh w a Second,  should e add  the ilt  olicy  o  the  announcement? Third,  hould e immediately w t ofp t s w release  he ull  irective? t f d

I  believe  hat  nnouncements  should e  used  on  occasion  ven  when there  s o t a b e i n change  in  policy.  irst,   here  ere significant  certainty  out hether  or ot olicy  ould F ift w un ab w n p w change, e might  explain hy we chose  not  to  change  policy. econd, f  e were  expected o w w S i w t change  policy  nd  did  not,  gain e might  explain  hy. Third,  f  e did ot hange  policy  ut a a w w i w n c b changed  the ilt    the irective,  en  we should xplain  hy.  On the ther  and, e should ot t in d th e w o h w n be  in   position ere we feel ompelled  to  make an  announcement  in  the ase  where  we were a wh c c not  expected  o  change  policy  nd  did ot. t a n

Whether policy  s  symmetric r  asymmetric  is   very  simple ay of  conveying i o a w important  nformation  o he arket  and  to  the ublic  ore generally  bout ow the OMC i t t m p m a h F weighs  the isks  oing  forward.   believe  e should nnounce  our  assessment  f  those isks  fter r g I w a o r a each  meeting.  Would we make less  se  of n  asymmetric  bias?  I hink hat  f  e agree o e u a t t i w t b honest nd  use  this  rocedural  hange  to nhance  public  ransparency,   will  ot se  it ny  less. a p c e t we n u a

I  think  he  memos  we received  n this  ssue  ontained  wo  very  interesting  guments t o i c t ar against  mmediately eleasing e  entire  irective. rst,   as said hat  he pening aragraph  s i r th d Fi itw t t o p i written  efore he eeting  and  is asically cuous.  Second,  it as noted hat he  language f b t m b va w t t o the  directive ither ys  what  it  eans nor  means what  it  ays.  Thinking bout his  ven  for ne sa m s a t e a few seconds  suggests  n  obvious olution. rst,   might  eliminate e  first ragraph nd a s Fi we th pa a perhaps eplace  t  ith  our  announcement.  Second, e could mprove  the anguage o  it ays r i w w i l s s what we mean and  we can  honestly  ay  we mean what  we say.  My  first eference  s o ublish s pr i t p a  new and  improved  directive.    second  best s o  announce  our ilt  cision  ollowing  ach My i t t de f e meeting.  In  addition, pending n  the  Committee's ecision, ould  like  o  provide n de o d I  w t a explanation  hen there s  a  change  in he unds  rate,  change  in he ilt,    a  no-change irective w i t f a t t or d under he  circumstances  hat    detailed ove. t t I ab

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Ferguson.

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  After istening    a  number  of  very l to good  arguments rom  people ho have  much longer  enures  han  I  do  in his  rea,    will eigh  in f w t t t a I w just    little.  elieve  hat  e have  two  decisions   make. The  first   hether e should ake a I  b t w to isw w m any  announcements  after  eetings hen there s o  change  in  policy.    think  he nswer  to  that m w i n I t a is  "no"  because   don't  hink  uch  a  decision  epresents  consensus n  the ame sense s  a I t s r a i s a decision  o  change  policy. ill  oole  and  others  ave  suggested  hat  here  re  many and t B P h t t a differing asons  hy individual mbers of  the  Committee  may decide ot  to  make a  change  in re w me n policy.  t s ery  difficult, ou point  ut,  r.  Chairman,  to  write   clear  ummary statement I i v as  y o M a s about  such  a  decision.  e  spend  a  fair  mount of ime iscussing ctors lating  ur  policy W a t d fa re too preferences fore oming  to  a  consensus n  not hanging  policy,  ut e would  then  be  hard be c o c b w

pressed  o  state  learly d  concisely  he easons or  hat  onsensus. hat  exercise  ould  not e t c an t r f t c T w b productive.

Secondly,  ith  respect  o nnouncing he  tilt,  ctually  ee hat  s  a  close  all, ough w t a t I  a s t a c th I  have  a  slight eference  n  favor f aking an  announcement.  The  reason s hat    believe  he pr i o m i t I t tilt  es  reflect  change  in  policy  nd  a  consensus s eeded  to ake that  hange.  So,  I  think  t do a a i n m c i is seful  o nform  the  markets f hat  or   variety  f easons hat  thers  ave  alluded  o.  One is u t i o t f a o r t o h t that  e often ant  to  condition  arket  expectations    one  way or nother.  hat  may be  done w w m in a T through  statements  r  speeches hat  ou  make,  Mr.  Chairman,  but n  some sense eleasing r o t y i r ou decision  n  the ilt ter  ach  meeting s n  easier  ay to  accomplish hat  esult. condly, o t af e i a w t r Se I think e can  indeed ducate he  markets n what  this  eans.

MR. GUYNN. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  have  been  the eneficiary r any years b fo m of  the  wisdom and  experience  f d Boehne and  Mike Kelley,  nd  it  s ith  some uneasiness o E a i w that   ome out  on  the ther  ide n  this  ssue.    am most  comfortable  ith he inds f Ic o s o i I w t k o comments that  l  Broaddus  and  Bob Parry ade for he ollowing  easons. irst  f  all,    would A m t f r F o I agree  with  Alice ivlin  hat t he inimum  we certainly ould e  able o  find   way to edefine R t a t m sh b t a r and  recast  he anguage elating   the  tilt.   did  it  n  the irst  ntence f he perational t l r to We i f se o t o paragraph  elating   the ederal  unds  rate,  nd  I  have  to  believe  hat  omebody can  in act  in r to f f a t s f w that obel  prize.  e  should ry gain. N W t a

Second,  I  guess he nspoken  assumption s hat  here  s o  turning  ack  once  we t u i t t i n b liberalize  r  disclosure licy.  e  will e  stuck ith  whatever dditional sclosures   go  to. ou po W b w a di we I  just ntion  that  ecause   do  not  think nybody  has  focused n  this  xplicitly. me b I a o e

I  also tart  ith  an  underlying  ias hat  ore transparency d  more information  re s w b t m an a better  han ess.    would  argue hat  erious  bservers  n  financial rkets nd  elsewhere f ur t l I t s o i ma a o o policymaking re  sophisticated  ough  to  understand  he uances  when we announce  the ilt  d a en t n t an they  also re  able o  interpret  anges n  the conomy between  the nnouncements  just  s  we a t ch i e a a have  to.

The other rgument  that    would  underscore  ithout epeating l f t  s hat a I w r al o i i t announcing  the ilt uld  avoid he  misinformation  hat  pread ust    couple f eetings go.  I t wo t t s j a o m a believe  hat  s oing o  happen  again.  It  as most  unfortunate  he ime.  We  all truggle th t i g t w att t s wi how to  deal  with  misinformation,  d  I  think  hat voiding  t  s orth  something.   think  avid an t a i i w I D

Clementi's  omments last  ight uggest  hat  he ank of ngland's  arly  xperience  ith c n s t t B E e e w delayed nformation  as  given  them  the  same type f  problem.  So,  announcing  our  decisions i h o does  in  my view  avoid he isk  f hat  I  call  slips," t leaks."   would  prefer  o  put   more t r o w " no " I t a charitable in n  that  nd  assume that  e simply rom  time  to  time  may say  something e sp o a w f w wished  we had  not. hat  cannot appen  if  e already  ave  made the  announcement. T h w h

I  also gree ith  the omment that  ny  small tep e can  take hat  educes he  sense f a w c a s w t r t o secrecy  hat  urrounds  ur  activities  n ur  long-term nterest    an  organization.   simply t s o i i   o i as We need  to  move a  little  rther  hat  irection.  don't  elieve  e can  make these nnouncements fu int d I b w a on  an  ad  hoc  basis  t ne  meeting  and  not  at nother.    think  t  as  to e  a  routine  hat  e use or a o a I i h b t w f every  meeting.  The  cleanest  nd  simplest  ay would  in  fact  e  to elease  he perational a w b r t o paragraph f  the irective.  akes are f  announcing  the ilt d  it  lso ccommodates Al o d Itt c o t an a a Broaddus's  roposal o  announce  our  fed unds  target  t very eeting,  ot ust  hen we have p t f a e m n j w changed  it. his  is ot  a  "slam  dunk"  issue,  ut   have  a  modest  preference  o ome out n  that T n b I t c o side f  it.  hank you, r.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice  Chairman.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr.  Chairman,   wind  up  agreeing ith he  very I w t fine xplanations   President  oehne and  Governor  Kelley hat  ave  been  supported  y  a e by B t h b number of  people,  ut  let  e say  why. First  f ll,    bit f istory:  he  reason hat  e decided b m o a a o h T t w in  February 994  to nnounce  changes  in  the unds ate  as  partly  ransparency d  partly 1 a f r w t an ethics.  he Committee's revious  olicy f aking a  decision  nd  then  having he esk at he T p p o m a t D t New  York Bank in  effect  pprise  he ognoscenti  hrough ts  perations  he  market  seemed,  in a t c t i o int my view  as  someone who had  been  in  the usiness  2  years,  o  verge n  the nethical. e b 2 t o u Th reason s  that  t  learly  ad  the ffect  f etting  e nsiders ow before he nwashed knew. So, i i c h e o l th i kn t u one  of  the ain  reasons e changed  that  ractice   my view  was because t  as the ight  hing m w p in i w r t to  do,  the oral  thing  o  do.  At  the ime,  e also ecided hat  f  here  as  a  change  in  the ilt, m t t w d t i t w t it would not e  announced, nd  that  s ow we got  into he nnouncement  mode that    mentioned b a i h t a I earlier.

It eems  to  me that  e can  go  one  of wo  ways at he resent  ime.  We  can  either ay s w t t p t st where  we are, hich  is hat  I hink e should o,  or  we can  move to  announcing s  soon  as w w t w d a possible  hat  the  policy  ecision  as  been.  I  think    number  of eople ho are f he atter w d h a p w o t l persuasion  ave  concluded hat  e would probably ssue    cleaned-up  perational ragraph hat h t w i a o pa t is nderstandable   the  average erson.   see  that  s  a  big roblem  because uch  a  paragraph u to p I a p s would inevitably ate  ery  baldly  hat  is n  fact   very  sophisticated sage.  Monetary  policy st v w i a mes is ot  an  "on  and  off" itch or  is t    partially  , artially  f witch,  hich is he  tilt.   s n sw n i a on p of s w t Iti

rather  omething hat  ne  is rying  o o  in  order o  have  a  better onomy at he nd  of he ay s t o t t d t ec t e t d for he  good  of he  American  people nd  people round  the  world. t t a a

I  think  ur  present  olicy,  hich  is o  make an  announcement  when there  s   change o p w t i a in  the ederal  unds ate,  s ery lear  nd  very  specific.  s asily  nderstandable.  e need f f r i v c a Iti e u Ifw some additional planation  f hat  we are  doing, deally  have  the umphrey-Hawkins ex o w i we H testimony  r, f  ot,  he  Chairman  can  either eate  r ake dvantage f  a speech  opportunity. o i n t cr o t a o We have  the  great  dvantage f aving  an  unusually  apable pokesman, ho is ble  to rovide a o h c s w a p all hose easures  of  subtlety d  nuances  that    believe  re  a  very mportant  art f he olicy t m an I a i p o t p message.  We  simply annot o  that  n  an  announcement  that  e have  to  release  n  the ay  of c d i w o d the  meeting. f e did,  e would have  exactly  he  problem  that  d Boehne described  o  well I w w t E s We  would  spend  the hole  meeting  shadowboxing  about  what  we were  going ay  at he  end  of w s t the  meeting.  That  would  take ny  spontaneity t  of he eeting,  hich  is lready a ou t m w a unspontaneous nough  because  of  the nowledge  that  he  whole  transcript   ventually  oing  to e k t ise g be  released.  o,  people ome into he  meeting ith  prepared emarks.  It s lways  hard  for e S c t w r i a m to  believe  hat f  e have  prepared  emarks,  e will pend  a  lot f ime  listening   he ther t i w r w s o t tot o people ho have  been  trying  o  share ome information  ith  us. w t s w

I  think  hat  eleasing ything  n  the  day  of he eeting ould  make the eeting t r an o t m w m a completely  nspontaneous  et  iece,  nd  as  a  result  would  have  poor  monetary olicy. t s u s p a we p I i wonderful o  have  transparent  netary  policy.  f e could  have  the est ossible  onetary t mo I w b p m policy  nd  the ost  transparent  netary  policy,  think  hat  ould  be  the  ideal.    don't  hink  e a m mo I t w I t w can  have  both.  In  my view  we are etter  ff  aving he est ossible  onetary  policy  xplained b o h t b p m e to  the merican people n  a  way that n  fact orks  quite  ell,  hich  is hat  we have  now.  So,  I A i i w w w w am very  much in  favor f etaining r  present  ormula. o r ou f

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Teer. Mc

MR. MCTEER. Coming into he  meeting oday, y second  choice as to  announce t t m w the  bias.   thought hat  ould  be  my ultimate  hoice ecause   didn't ink y first oice I t w c b I th m ch would get  anywhere.  My  first  oice ould  be  to  stop oting ormally  n  the ias. e  do  talk ch w v f o b W about t;  e have  a  rough  idea f here  each  of s  stands;  nd  we know  what  the onsensus i w o w u a c seems  to e.  Accordingly,    do  not ee  a  lot  f dvantage o  having   formal ote nd  then b I s o a t a v a having  the ilemma of hether  to  release  hat  ote r  not. owever,  I  found  President ehne's d w t v o H Bo and  Governor  Kelley's  nitial  marks ery  persuasive, d  in articular  ey onvinced e that i re v an p th c m we should ot  announce  the ilt.  ey partially  nvinced e that  here  s   benefit  o  having n t Th co m t i a t a formal  bias,  ut   suspect  hat  e could etain  he enefit  f he  bias  nd  still  t  formally  ote b I t w r t b o t a no v on  it.  hat  would  eliminate  he ilemma  about eleasing   hortly  fter  he  meeting. here I T t d r its a t W come down is o  make no  change  but  to onsider  he dvantages  f  not aving  a  formal ote  on t c t a o h v the  bias.

I  have  some concern bout sking ither  he  Chairman  or nybody  else o  go  out  and a a e t a t convey  information  bout he  direction at  ommittee  policy  s aking  n  the  absence  of  a a t th C i t i

reasonably  orthright  atement  f he ommittee's  ecision.  n  this  egard,    think    "no f st o t C d I r I a change"  decision  an  be  as  much a  policy  ecision  s  a  change  in  policy  r  a  change  in  the c d a o direction   the ilt.  ,  if  e feel  ompelled o repare he arkets,    think t  s ore consistent of t So w c t p t m I i i m with  the otion  hat  he  decision  s   Committee  decision  o  have  the ommittee make a n t t i a t C statement  bout here  it  s han o ely  ven  on  the  Chairman  and  especially   the est  f s  as a w i t t r e on r o u individuals.   e go  out  as  individuals d  present  ur  own views, e risk  aving  them Ifw an o w h interpreted    a  variety  f ays. We  obviously  annot hange  how the ournalistic  munity in o w c c j com views  us  and  how  it  ries  rive edges  between  us,  at east  n he  press. ut  I  think  t  s asier t tod w l i t B i i e to  have  a  common  front  f  e have  a  common  statement.  hat worries  e is hat  e seem  to i w W m t w have  some sympathy  for reparing  he arkets, ut  we don't  eem  to  want  to o  that  s  a p t m b s d a Committee.  We  seem  to ant  to  do  that  s  individuals,   I hink  hat  as  some risk. w a and t t h

The  risk  f emagoguery is lways  there.  e  get emagogued whether  we make o d a W d announcements  or  not.   think  ur  ability    withstand  emagoguery  is hat  makes us  credible. I o to d w It as  made us  credible  n  the ast nd  it ill ake us  credible  n he uture, d  I  do  not hink h i p a w m i t f an t whether  we disclose  r  not isclose  ill hange  things    whole  lot  n  that  egard.   think  here  s o d w c a i r I t i an advantage o  demystifying  hat  the ommittee says,  nd  I  think  here ay be  simple ays of t w C a t m w doing  that.    know when we talked  bout larifying  e irective as on  the pposite  ide f I a c th d I  w o s o this  rgument.  My  thoughts  ave  changed  over ime.  There  may in  fact  e  ways after  his a h t b t discussion  r  maybe other  iscussions at  ollow f  making  the  directive earer,  eleasing o d th f o cl ofr the  minutes  or he  operational ragraph arlier. t pa e

I  come down on the ide f  feeling  ore comfortable  ith  the dea f isclosing r s o m w i o d ou thoughts  n  a  simple ay after  very eeting.

MR. HOENIG. Mr.  Chairman,  as  I ooked  at his  ssue nd  went  back  and  read  some l t i a of  its  istory,   eemed  clear  o e that  he hole  idea f  the ilt    it  as designed n  an  earlier h it s t m t w o t as w i period as  to  allow  compromise  and  build onsensus.  t s n  internal chanism for w c I i a me decisionmaking.    think  he ay we announce  actions  ow is he orrect  ay,  and  releasing e I t w n t c w th tilt ll  ot  add  to ransparency cause he  directive  nguage elating    the  tilt wi n t be t la r to is incomprehensible. f  ransparency   our  goal  and  we want  to  have  the ontext  f ur  thinking I t is c o o in  our elease  f nformation  o  the ublic,  hen  I elieve  overnor  Gramlich  has  a  very  good r o i t p t b G point. e  should hen  focus n putting  he  minutes ogether  ecause  they ncorporate e ull W t o t t b i th f context  f ur  decision, d  we could  release  hem earlier. t  I  think rying  o ome up  with  a o o an t Bu t t c statement  t  the nd  of his  eeting o  be  released  o  the ublic t :15  p.m.  and  to  frame  it  n  the a e t m t t p a 2 i context  f he  discussion  his  eeting  is  an  almost mpossible  ask or  nyone.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. We  actually  id mprove  the  directive  ce  before. d i on

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. This  directive   lear  y  comparison! isc b [Laughter]

MR.  MOSKOW. But  I  think  e can  do  better. w

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let  me suggest  he ollowing.  roposition e  is hat  f t f P on t i we make a  change  it  s rreversible.  t's  e  certain  hat  o  the xtent  e make a  change, e are i i Le b t t e w w all omfortable  hat  e are  not  going o  say  three eetings ater at  t  as a  mistake nd  we c t w t m l th i w a should  go  back.  We  will  ot  be  able o  go  back.  I  think his  as  been  a  very  useful  iscussion n t t h d in all  espects.  would  put t  o on Kohn to  do  the ollowing  f  veryone s n  agreement-r I i t D f i e i i [Laughter]

MR.  KOHN. If    have  the onsensus! I c

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. There  is   lot f entiment  or  eleasing e  directive. a o s f r th It is ot  a  majority.  ncidentally,   decision  ike  his,  s ot he ommittee  per  se  but he  19,  or n I in  a l t iti n t C t

now  18,  who should ake the ecision  ecause e are  all nvolved.    think t  ould  be  a m d b w i I i w mistake o  base  a  decision  trictly the  views  of hose ho happen  to e  on  the ommittee  at  a t s on t w b C particular  me.  I  think e all hould e  equally  epresented   this  ype f ecision.  here  is ti w s b r in t o d T some sentiment,    considerable ount of  sentiment, r eleasing e  directive. ere  may even a am fo r th Th be  more  if  e make the irective herent. w d co

MS. RIVLIN.  There  might  be  less!

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. There  is he  crucial estion  bout he alue n he t qu a t v i t deliberative  ocess f  various  radations   agreement,  hich  is hat  the ilt  s  enabled s  to pr o g of w w t ha u do. I  think  e should ome back  to his  ssue  fter  1) eeing hether  we can  find    way to w c t i a ( s w a clarify e  wording  of he irective d  (2) xamining  the nteresting stion  hat  ome of  you th t d an e i que t s have  raised  bout he arlier  lease  f he inutes. hat  would  require  emoving  all  he a t e re o t m T r t contingency  aterial, t  that  ay not e  a  particular  oblem. m bu m b pr

After hat,  would  suggest  hat nstead  utting    variety  f lternatives  the able  e t I t i p a o a on t w limit  he hoices. n  other  ords  the hoices ight  include 1) aintaining  he  status o,  doing t c I w c m ( m t qu nothing,  r  (2)  clarifying  e ording  of he irective  d  releasing   t  some point.  hat  would o th w t d an ita T automatically t he  tilt to he  public omain as  quickly s  any  announcement.  In  principle, ge t in t d a I think he  proposal  hat  athy  Minehan made is here  we would  be  if e could et  there, mely, t t C w w g na to  have  a  statement  fter  ach  meeting f hat  the ommittee  meant.  I ust  hink  hat  pproach a e o w C j t t a is ot  feasible.  do  not hink t  ould e  done, nd  I  would  suggest  hat  hat  would  come out f n I t i c b a t w i we succeeded n  doing  it  ould  be  some boilerplate  milar  hat  the  G-7 comes up  with, i w si tow which  is wful.  If here  ere  a  way to  do  it,    think  t ould  be  the ost  useful  hing  e could a t w I i w m t w do.  The directive   he  next ehicle, t  the irective  rries  ith  it he roblem, s  stated  n  the ist v bu d ca w t p a i very  eloquent  emarks  of oth d Boehne and  Mike Kelley,  f nterpreting   meaning  being r b E o i the

conveyed  by  the entence  n the ilt. lso ould like  o  say  that    think he  issue  hat  ill s o t I  a w t I t t B McDonough  raises  ith  respect  o he  art orm  of  constructing  netary  policy  s elatively w t t f mo i r important.  e  are ngaged  in  a  very ifficult ivity.   can  make it  ore difficult W e d act We m for ourselves  f  e lock n  certain  ssues  ithout   full  nderstanding  f he  implications. i w i i w a u o t

I  hate o ay  this, t  we will ave  to  come back  to  this  ssue  gain.   do  think hat  n t s bu h i a I t i doing  so  we will e  able o arrow  the  alternatives te ignificantly.  s  has  been  a  very b t n qui s Thi productive  o-around.  It as  clarified umber of  issues  or e as  well, nd  I ave  been  around g h a  n f m a h for uite    while. q a
