MR.  RIVES.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.

MR.  SIEGMAN. Thank you  very  much. On my list  f hings  rom  the ederal o t f F Reserve  that    will ook ack  to,  his  s ne  of he ctivities t    will  iss ery  much. I l b t i o t a tha I m v

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. When  all f   sudden  we begin o  see  a  hole n  the taff o a t i s analysis,   will nfer  ts  ause.  [Laughter] ould somebody like  o  move approval f he we i i c W t o t minutes  of he ovember  12 meeting? t N

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. So move.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without  objection, ey  are  approved.  Mr.  Fisher, u th yo have  the  floor.

MR. FISHER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  will e  referring  he b tot package  of olored harts, ich  you  should ind n ront  f  you. c c wh f i f o

On the  first ge  are harts  overing he ame information  have pa c c t s we shown in  the ast,  ut e have  changed  the ource f he ata or he  current p b w s o t d f t 3-month  deposit  ates. raders ave  persuaded e that  he  LIBOR  fixing r T h m t provides    better mparison han  the  Eurodollar ries  e have  been  using, a co t se w so  that  s   slight ange. i a ch

Focusing  first   U.S.  forward ates, ere  re  two  points  o  which  I on r th a t would draw  your  attention. e is hat  here  as  been  relatively  ttle  t On t t h li ne change  in  these  ates  ince  he ovember meeting,  s  shown by  the ed r s t N a r lines, t  clearly  ome compression as  occurred  s  the oney market  yield bu s h a m curve  has  become increasingly  atter    the eriod ince ctober.   think fl in p s O I

the  updrift   the olid  ine,  he urrent  ollar BOR, reflects  fairly in s l t c d LI a typical  ear-end  henomenon. I  would not  attach  ny  significance   hat. y p a tot

Looking  at he  German forward  rates, .  Tietmeyer aid ather t Mr s r publicly  n  November  14 what  other  undesbank  officials  ve  been  saying o B ha for ome time, amely,  that  he arket  should ot xpect erman rates  o  go s n t m n e G t up  by 120  basis  oints  etween  now and  next ay  to  meet  Italian tes p b M ra halfway,  s  the arket  had  come to  believe  as going o appen.  In  effect, a m w t h Tietmeyer as saying hat  he  German economy is  stronger  ut  not eally  ll w t t b r a that  trong. ou can  see  the entle rift wnward in  German forward s Y g d do rates.  f  ou  look  at he olid  lue ine,  he urrent  ark  LIBOR, it  s uite I y t s b l t c m i q interesting  at  he pike n  early  ecember parallels  e  spike n he en th t s i D th i t y LIBOR,  shown in  the hart  elow, t  the ime  of eightened  oncerns bout c b a t h c a the apanese remium. Now, this  s nteresting  r hose f s  in he  money J p i i fo t o u t market  business,   it  ere, ecause he  calculations lly  re uite as w b t rea a q different.    the ritish nkers  Association  anel or he en  LIBOR In B Ba p f t y fixing, ere re  eight  apanese anks,  hereas  in he anels or he ollar th a J b w t p f t d and  the ark,  there  re  only hree  nd  the alculation   one  by  throwing m a t a c isd out  the  highs nd  the ows.  So,  I hink  he pike n  the erman  money a l t t s i G market  rates  eflects  e  demand for unds  from  the apanese anks.  It  s ot r th f J b i n a  reflection   he redit  remium,  as  it  ere, rom  the emand side ut oft c p w f d b a pushing hrough f  the  demand coming  from  the apanese anks. t o J b

Turning  to  the apanese arket,  e need  a  little  gnification  he J m w ma oft bottom  panel o  see  what  is oing  on  in apan.  So, f  ou  turn o  the econd t g J i y t s page,   will  ork  through ome of he vents n  the apanese arkets. I w s t e i J m Three  rates  re raced  n  the op anel:  he urrent  en  LIBOR  3-month a t i t p t c y deposit  ixing  n ark  purple,  he -month  forward  3-month  yen  deposit  ate f i d t 9 r in  orange-yellow, d  the apanese vernight  all  ate  n  green.  In  the an J o c r i middle  panel,  e have  plotted e  excess eserves  n  the apanese anking w th r i J b system.  I  talked  o ank of apan  officials   ome length  bout  their t B J ats a calculation  his  easure.  It s  not  quite  ow we would  calculate ,  ut t oft m i h itb i is he  way they o  it.  he chart llustrates   eightened  enerosity at  he t d T i theh g th t Bank of apan  was practicing   leaving  heir  arket  in  considerable J by t m surplus  ollowing  he losure f amaichi  and  subsequently  n  the ast  ew f t c o Y i l f days.  The  bottom  panel as  two  measures  of he apanese remium in h t J p dollar  nterest  tes: e  solid  ine  s he ifference tween  the -month i ra th l i t d be 1 LIBOR  rates  t  the ank of okyo-Mitsubishi  nd  at  Chase, nd  the otted a B T a a d line  s he uji ate  inus  the ank of okyo-Mitsubishi  ate.  here  was i t F r m B T r T some modest  differentiation  ng Japanese ames at he eight f  the amo n t h o crisis,  t  clearly e ominant  difference y be  seen  in he omparison bu th d ma t c between  the est apanese ame and  Chase  as  shown in his  xample. b J n t e

Going back  to  the op  panel,    would  like  o  draw out wo  points.  ne t I t t O is  that  n  the ast  ew days  the ank of apan  has  pushed he  overnight  all i l f B J t c rate  own into  he  20  basis  oint ange.  Bank of apan  official  s  told d t p r A J ha me that  you  may call  his    temporary asing."  I  took hat  o ean that  he " t a e t t m t emphasis  was on "you" because  they ere  not oing  to all  t hat  ut oud w g c i t o l quite et.  But  clearly,  ey ave  pushed  the vernight  all  ate  own. The y th h o c r d gap  between  the  purple ine  howing  the urrent  IBOR  and  the  orange  line l s c L does  tend o ndicate  hat  he urrent  remium is xpected o  wash  out  on  the t i t t c p e t other ide f  the iscal  ear. hat  is,  he igh  premium,  high emand for s o f y T t h d funds  coming  out f he apanese anks  is hought  y  the  market  to e o t J b t b b something  that  ill  ash out  9-months  forward hen we get appily  o  the w w w h t other ide f he  Japanese iscal ar-end n  March. s o t f ye i

Turning  to  the hird  age,  hought   would  give  a  little  ckground  on t p It I ba events n  East sia.  I  know Ted Truman will  e  speaking ore about hat. i A b m t The main  purpose  of hese  anels s o emind  us  that  his  s ot ust    bad t p i t r t i n j a thunderstorm  ut  something ore like  he  100-year lood. he top anel b m t f T p shows  the xchange  rate  ovements since uly ; the iddle  panel as e m J 1 m h percent  hanges  in  equity  ndices; d  the ottom  panel epicts  -month c i an b d 1 interest  tes.  ocusing n  the urrency  anel,    think t's  sy o  say  that ra F o c p I i ea t the  currencies ve  overshot  heir  undamental alues.  ut  I  think  t's ha t f v B i important  o ecognize  hat  here  s till  very  large  osition erhang t r t t i s a p ov weighing  on  these xchange  markets.  In  effect,  leveraged  onvergence e a c trade  s  we would  have  called  t  n  Europe  a  few years go, hort  ollar  r a i i a s d o yen  external  urrencies d  long nternal rrencies,  s embedded on  the c an i cu wa balance heets f  businesses roughout  he  region,  nd  they ave  not et s o th t a h y completed  hedging hose xposures. n  these  hin arkets,  oth  bankers nd t e I t m b a traders  ave  a  very ard ime hinking  f hese urrencies   having  overshot h h t t o t c as because  they re ware  of ow much more there s et o  hedge  that  s a a h i y t i weighing  on  the  exchange  rate.

A second  inference    would  draw  from  this  age  is o  note hat  he I p t t t downward slope f he  foreign  xchange  and  equity alues s omewhat o t e v i s steeper  han he pward slope n  the  1-month  interest  tes  t he ottom. t t u i ra a t b Another  point    would  note s hat  o  far aiwan,  the ed ine,  as  managed I i t s T r l h to  distinguish  self.    the op anel  you  can  see  that  ts  urrency as it In t p i c h declined  gainst  he  dollar  nly lightly  re than he en; nd  in he  middle a t o s mo t y a t panel,  ou  can  see hat  heir  quity  arket  has  really oken  out  of he ack. y t t e m br t p While  looking t his  hart  verall, hink t  s ossible  hat  e will ook a t c o I  t i i p t w l back  and  see hat  he nd-of-year fect  or ome of hese urrencies d t t e ef f s t c an values rovided omething  of   nadir or hem, iven  the isk  version  hat p s a f t g r a t is  generally pical  t his  ime  of ear. ut  I  think t  ould  be  risky  o ty a t t y B i w t count  on  a  bounceback  after  he ew  Year  for ll f hem. t N a o t

Turning  to he  fourth  age,   have  depicted  n he op  panel oth  the t p I i t t b March Eurodollar  ontract  nd  the arch fed  funds  futures  ontract  s  they c a M c a have  traded  hroughout  he all.  here  is elatively  ttle  t hange  in  both t t f T r li ne c those eries  rom  just  rior  o he ovember meeting o oday.  The middle s f p t t N t t panel hows the  U.S.  Treasury  onstant  aturity  ields  or 0,  10  and  2 s c m y f 3 years.  You can  see  that  e have  had  a  continued  ecline  n ond  yields  n w d i b i the  30-  and 10-year reas,  hile he ield  n  the -year ote as  been  more a w t y o 2 n h or  less  lat  ver hat  ime  horizon. learly, is  s omething hat  s uite f o t t C th i s t i q difficult  interpret.  hink  hat  ith  the  worsening f he sian  crisis, to I  t t w o t A market  participants e  inferred at  here  ill e  no  action  t his  eeting, hav th t w b a t m and  more of hem  have  come to  adopt he eflationist look  r  at east  re t t d out o l a taking t  ore seriously an hey  did  some time  ago.  While  point  stimates i m th t e for nflation  ve  moved down a  bit,    think he etter planation  hat i ha I t b ex ist market  participants e  shaved  off he  upside isk  n  the nflation hav t r i i probability  stribution,  t  s,  he isk  hat  nflation  ll ise  ver he ext di tha i t r t i wi r o t n six onths.  That  is hat  is ending  o  bring own the ield urve  in m w t t d y c combination ith  the light-to-quality, f-year fect, king  market w f end-o ef ma participants  re comfortable  bout oving their  uration  ut he ield mo a m d o t y curve  in  this  nd-of-year vironment. e en

The last  age  of harts  elates   our  open  market  operations  his p c r to int period. he top  panel overs aily  ed  funds  trading: e lue  lines  how the T c d f th b s daily anges,  he ertical d ines  how the  standard  eviations,  d  the r t v re l s d an horizontal d  lines  ndicate e ffective tes. he  panel t he ottom  has re i th e ra T a t b the  level  f ree eserves  nd  indicates r  daily  isses rom  the rojections. o f r a ou m f p I  should oint  ut hat  t he tart  he  middle eriod,  hich  included p o t a t s oft p w Thanksgiving,  e raised  he  allowance or xcess eserves  rom  $1  billion w t f e r f to $1.4  billion. e demand for xcess eserves  learly s  been  inching  p. I Th e r c ha u do  not ant  to  suggest  hat  his  s   precise  cience, t e are rying  o  get w t t i a s bu w t t a  handle n how much it  as  drifted .

As you  can T h a s o D see, xcess eserves  veraged round  $2 billion  hat  eriod,  nd  we still e r a a int p a had  a  slightly  rm unds ate.  e  may have  slightly  ercompensated t fi f r W ov a the  beginning f he urrent  aintenance eriod,  ut  the arket  was quite o t c m p b m tight. esterday as a  corporate  ax ayment  date,  nd  we tried  o  prepare Y w t p a t the  market or hat. f t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The Southeast  sian  exchange  rate  atterns ply,  s A p im a you  say, hat    lot  f arket  participants   overshooting e undamentals  n  a  certain  ense. t t a o m are th f i s I is ifficult   void  that  ort  f onclusion.  e  cannot et   40  or  50  percent  ecline  n  an d toa s o c W g a d i exchange  rate n  a  short  eriod f ime  under ny  realistic umptions  oncerning  hat  has i p o t a ass c w changed.  Stock  prices  an  do  that.  hey reflect  t ong  positions,  d  if  veryone ecides o c T ne l an e d t pull ut, tock rices  ill o  to  zero.  But  exchange  rates  re ero-sum ames;  one  person's se o s p w g a z g ri is  another  erson's cline.  o,  this  xchange  rate  ecrease  ooks xtraordinarily  ge. ou p de S e d l e lar Y raised    question  hen you stated  hat  he alance f oreign  urrency  ositions  till a w t t b o f c p iss effectively  ng  in ocal  urrencies d  short  n ollars  r  perhaps en. One would  assume  that lo l c an i d o y forward  positions   the urrency,  f  hey  exist, uld  be  able o ick his  p.  I ave  never  seen in c i t wo t p t u h 9-month  or  1-year orwards n  baht/dollars.   they  exist? f o Do

MR. FISHER.  They exist.  hey are  quite  hinly  raded,  nd  I'm ot  sure ow much T t t a n h confidence  eople  put  in hem, ut  they re here.  hey are ot  the ind  of arket  instruments p t b a t T n k m that  ne  can  click  n  a  Reuters age  and  see. o o p

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. But  the uestion  s hether  they ive s  at  least q i w g u a partial swer.  If  e are etting  xtreme isequilibrium,  eep  forward ositions ght  to e an w g e d thed p ou b

closer  o  minus  10  or  minus 15 as  distinct  om  minus  40.  And if  e cannot nfer  t rom  these t fr w i i f other  ositions,   could n  principle ndle  the redit  isk  n  this  ituation--I en't  hought p we i ha c r i s hav t this  hrough--by  ocusing  n  the pot ate  djusted  or overed  interest  te ifferentials  ive t f o s r a f c ra d to  g us  an  idea f he orward  position.    wonder  whether e know anything bout he  more  distant o t f I w a t horizon n  order o nswer  the  question  bout  overshooting,    to  speak,  n  the djustment  f i t a a so i a o balances. f  ndeed hose alances re  precisely at  you  say, amely,  that  hey re  comprised I i t b a wh n t a of ong  positions   the ocal  urrency nd short  ositions   dollars, at  mbalance  would  give l in l c a p in th i us  a  very  significant  emium on  the orward  position s-a-vis  e  spot. t ould  be  very pr f vi th I w interesting  test  hat  f  he nformation  s t ll vailable. to t i t i i a a a

MR. TRUMAN. Are you  not ust  s  likely  ee  higher  hort-term terest  tes,   in j a tos s in ra so fact  t  ould  go  the ther  ay?  The forward  foreign  xchange  rates  ould  be  more depressed. i w o w e w You use  the  word position,  ich  is uite  ifferent-wh q d

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I'm  thinking  f -year orwards,  or xample. o 2 f f e

MR.  TRUMAN. I  don't  hink  ou  can  find -year orwards n hese arkets. f hey t y 2 f i t m I t existed, ey  would  tend  to  have  higher  nterest  tes  nd  would  be  more depressed  han he th i ra a t t current  pot ates. s r

MR. FISHER.  I  think  he  problem  is hat  e do  not ave  a  time  horizon here  one t t w h w ought  to  find  undamental alue. here  is ot nough  confidence  n  markets hat  ne  would f v T n e i t o want  to  have  a  contract th   maturity  f hat  ength.  hat  is   long  duration  xposure o  take wi a o t l T a e t on  a  currency hat  s eclining  o  rapidly  ow. t i d s n

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Before  the outheast  sian  markets ollapsed,  used S A c we to  talk  bout he bility   he oreans  to und  long-term  ebt ore readily  han  short-term, a t a oft K f d m t

which  goes  against  veryone's  iew  of he  way the orld  works.  Was  that  rue  hen r  was it e v t w t t o just  n  illusion? a

MR.  FISHER.  I  don't  now. I  have  not  heard hat  tory. k t s

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. If t  as true,  t  ould  be  an  indication at  here  s i w i w th t i a premium in  a  longer  orward xchange  rate. his  is   crucial estion  ecause he djustment  s f e T a qu b t a i either  oing  to mplode  down to inus  80  percent  r  it  s oing  to un  into ownside  resistance. g i m o i g r d

MR.  TRUMAN. Peter  isher  ay want  to omment,  but  I  think  t  s easonable  o ay F m c i i r t s that  any people  want  to  cover heir  ositions. ere  are  a  lot  f ifferent  ys of overing m t p Th o d wa c them.  Some covering an  be  done  in  the pot arket; ome in he orward arket;  some c s m s t f m through orrowing; nd  some through ending.  ow  it anifests  tself    individual  ses ay b a l H m i in ca m be  quite ifferent.    ou  have  thin arkets,  his  ontinuing  ctivity  y be  depressing  pot d Ify m t c a ma s exchange  rates  nd  you may get ome bounceback  even  though  the hole  process as  not layed a s w h p itself  t  because asically   one  is n  a  position  rovide orward over. ou b no i top f c

MR. FISHER.  I  think hat  we are  seeing  s  the mplosion  f he ntermediation w i i o t i process  n  these xchange  markets. he exchange  markets or he  won and  the aht ave i e T f t b h disappeared.  here  are ot  a  lot f eople ho are xcited  bout articipating hose arkets.

brief.    thought,  owever, hat    would  offer    few remarks n  some of he I h t I a o t tougher alls  e had  to  make on  the omestic ide f ur  forecast--namely c w d s o o those  relating   he utlook  or ages,  the  stock arket, nd  capital tot o f w m a spending.

Before  that, wever, ust    few  words on  this  orning's  tatistics: ho j a m s The CPI--total d  core--increased  st  .1  percent  n  November.  The an ju 0 i twelve-month hanges  were 1.8  percent  or he  total  PI and  2.2 ercent  or c f t C p f the  core--the tal    tenth  elow  our  Q4/Q4 forecast d  the  core ight  n  it. to a b an r o

Housing  starts se  slightly  rther st  onth. We  had  expected ro fu la m a dropback.  Most of he  upside urprise s in  the  lower  value  multifamily t s wa segment, hich  held  at  a  high evel.  or  what  it's  rth,    am told hat  his w l F wo I t t may be  the esult   a  new seasonal  attern  elated   efforts   qualify  or r of p r to to f tax reaks n low-income  housing  projects.  e'll ave  to  look  into hat b o W h t further.  ingle-family arts re  up a  little,   permits  ere  down,  so  this S st we but w more important  egment  looks roadly n  line  ith  our  prediction s b i w of flatness.

Now  back  to  my main  theme, ome of he  tougher ssues  n  the s t i i projection. e first oted  was the  outlook or ages. As you know, we Th I  n f w have  forecast at  ages and  total mpensation ill ecelerate  lightly h w co w d s in the  next ear,  n  the ace f ontinued  ow  unemployment.  We  certainly e y i f o c l ar not  arguing hat  he abor arket  is ot ight.  e  have  heard he  anecdotes t t l m n t W t and  read  the urveys,  s  you  have, nd  we are ersuaded hat inding  nd s a a p t f a retaining alified rkers  is   major  problem  for mployers. hile  many qu wo a e W firms ontinue o  report  hat  hey ill o  just  bout nything  hey  can  to c t t t w d a a t avoid  raising eir  age bills--including   forgoing  xpansion th w even e opportunities--wage reases  ave  been  creeping  p  for   while ow. inc h u a n

My  gut  tells  that  he ressure  s uilding  n  this  abor arket ot  to me t p i b i l m p where  the id  ould low off. ut, or etter  r  worse, ur  forecast s  not l c b B f b o o ha been  shaped  by  this  isceral nsation.  n articular, have  given  major v se I p we weight o  the  observations at  ages are ather  nertial  d  that  hey an  be t th w r i an t c significantly ected  y  perceived  rends  n  prices.  nd,  at his  oint, aff b t i A t p workers  and  employers  are ooking t ery  low  inflation  er he  past ear, l a v ov t y and  they hould e  seeing ore of he  same for   while onger,  iven s b m t a l g conditions  n  goods  markets. he net esult   our  forecast   still  hefty i T r in is a further  ise  n  real  ages  and  a  marked  increase  n he abor hare f he r i w i t l s o t income  pie--but  ot n  upward wage-price piral. n a s

Another  tough  call  elates   the tock  arket  outlook.  s you  know, r to s m A in  light  f ur eassessment  f he rospects  or nflation, have o o r o t p f i we eliminated  ur  prior  ssumption f n  increase  n  the  federal  unds ate.  e o a o a i f r W

had  viewed  that  ightening   an  important  rigger r   marked  downturn  in t as t fo a the  market  in he  first lf  f ext ear.  The question  efore s, hen,  as t ha o n y b u t w whether  disappointing  rporate  arnings  lone ould  be expected o co e a c t produce  a  significant rection fore ong.  Our answer  was yes, ut  that cor be l b the  decline  ill ikely   more gradual nd  smaller  verall--about  percent w l be a o 15 from  yesterday's  ose y early 999. Question arks  remain, owever. cl b 1 m h

To date,  ndividual mpanies  or  industries  ve  been  punished or ad i co ha f b earnings  nnouncements, ut his eemingly as  occasioned  erely  a a b t s h m rotation   other ectors  y determined quity  nvestors. ,  could  the to s b e i So market  shrug  off  he egative  ews we are  forecasting? rhaps,  t east  or t n n Pe a l f a  while.  Certainly,   our umbers,  aggregate  ear-on-year ofit on n y pr comparisons ill ot  begin o  look eally or  until  ext ummer or  fall. w n t r po n s

That  said,  hough,    think here  s he istinct  ssibility t,  nce  the t I t i t d po tha o deterioration  profits mes clearly to iew,  the  market  could  develop f co in v even  more downward momentum  than  we have  anticipated.  ould note I  w that  e are  currently ojecting  low  for he ilshire  000  in  1999  that w pr a t W 5 would  only ake  it  ack  to here it  as this  pring  nd  leave rice-earnings t b w w s a p multiples  t  historically  h  levels.   combination f evised  arnings a hig A o r e expectations d  any  further crease  n he  equity  remium from  what an in i t p probably as  occurred ecently  ould  point o  a  much more sizable  ecline, h r w t d unless  nterest  tes  ere  to  fall  ppreciably  he  same time. i ra w a att

Finally,  few  thoughts  n  the utlook  or usiness  nvestment.  his s a o o f b i T i a  sizable  ector  nd  one  that  as  provided   lot f ropulsion  or he s a h a o p f t expansion o  date.  We  have  forecast  significant  celeration    capital t a de in spending,  nd  while his  ets   little  rcular,    its ll  with  our redictions a t g a ci it f we p of  rising uity  apital sts nd  decelerating  tput. owever,  most  of  the eq c co a ou H indications   his  oint re  that  nvestment  lans re  very trong  oing  into att p a i p a s g 1998. For  example, he  semi-annual urvey f  the ational  ssociation  f t s o N A o Purchasing  anagers indicated at  anufacturers  re xpecting  o M th m a e t increase  heir  apital  xpenditures xt ear y 15 percent--an en  greater t c e ne y b ev increment  han  they eported  or his  ear. he NFIB's  November survey f t r f t y T o small  firms lso howed extremely pbeat nvestment  lans. a s u i p

These  surveys nderscore  he isk  hat  nvestment  ill,  et gain,  rove u t r t i w y a p stronger  han e have  gauged.  But, here s ome reason o  doubt  their t w t i s t predictive  wer in  the resent  ase.  For  one  thing, en  if  he urveys  re po p c ev t s a merely  a  few  weeks  old,  hey ay still    providing  retty  tale  eadings. t m be p s r Just  ooking t  how our  own changing erception  f he  international l a p o t outlook as  altered  ur  GDP  projection er he ast ew  weeks,  it eems h o ov t p f s reasonable  o hink  hat  usinesses  re  also eassessing eir  lans nd  that t t t b a r th p a many of  them  will e  trimming  their  nvestment  udgets. f  e are  wrong, b i b I w

MR. TRUMAN. Our message  about he  international nomy and  the t eco external  ector  f he .S.  economy is traightforward  d  easily s o t U s an summarized:  We  have  a  weaker  outlook or et xports, imarily  s  a f n e pr a consequence  of he urther  eterioration  economic  and  financial t f d f conditions  n  Asia.  While  I  am tempted  to  stop t his  oint  nd  turn o i a t p a t questions, ere ay be  a  bit  ore that    usefully n  add.  It  s rue  hat  e th m m I ca i t t w are  again rojecting ower lobal  rowth, n  particular    Asia. e  also re p sl g g i in W a projecting  stronger llar  nd  lower  oil  rices; e  first   ssociated   a a do a p th isa to considerable gree, hough  not  entirely,  th  Asian  developments,  ut de t wi b those evelopments ave  only  marginally  ffected  ur  view  of il  rices. d h a o o p Finally,  have  updated ur  worse-case cenario, d  I  will ay  a  few we o s an s words  about ur  current  hinking  n  that  ubject. o t o s

With  respect  o  the urrent  uarter,  have  very  little  rd  data n t c q we ha o U.S.  international nsactions; de  ata or ctober ill ot  be  released tra tra d f O w n until  hursday.  However, we have  written  own  a  small egative T d n contribution   et  exports  o  GDP  growth  this  uarter,    contrast th  a ofn t q in wi small  positive ntribution   he ovember Greenbook.  This  estimate  s co int N i based  primarily on three  onsiderations:  rst,  r  assessment  f he up c fi ou o t third-quarter a hat  evealed  omewhat weaker  exports  han  we had dat t r s t anticipated;  cond,   judgment  that  he nexpected trength  n  our  exports se a t u s i during he  first lf  f his  ear as coming  largely  rom  an  accelerator t ha o t y w f effect  n  exports f apital ods  that  as  waned with  the sian  crisis;  d o o c go h A an third, ecdotal  nformation,  r xample,  from  the  Beige  Book and  the an i fo e supplementary  eports  eceived  rom  Reserve  Banks  about he  apparent r r f t negative  ffects  f  he sian  crisis   trade lows his  uarter.  he e o t A on f t q T anecdotal  nformation,    turn,  s onsistent th  our  prior  ssessment  hat i in i c wi a t the  first-round  fects  he  Asian  crisis   our  trade  ill  e  felt  ooner ef oft on w b s rather  han ater. t l

Turning  to  our  forecasts r 998 and  1999,  our  aggregate  rojection fo 1 p of growth  in he  rest  f he orld, eighted y  U.S.  nonagricultural orts, t o t w w b exp is now 2-1/2 ercent  ext  year nd  3-1/4 ercent  he ollowing  ear,  ompared p n a p t f y c with  a  trend  ate f round   percent.  ost  of he ownward  adjustment  s r o a 4 M t d i for he  developing  conomies  in  Asia, here  we anticipate  eater ar-term t e w gr ne

Our outlook or apan  and  the ther ndustrial  untries s  been f J o i co ha affected  y  our  revised  iew  of ollar  xchange  rates.  s Peter isher  as b v d e A F h reported,  he ollar  trengthened ainst  oth  the  yen  and  the ontinental t d s ag b c European  currencies ring he  intermeeting riod. e  attribute  e  yen's du t pe W th weakness  to  continuing  uestion  arks  hanging  over he apanese conomy q m t J e and  financial stem--questions  rks  that  e do  not xpect ill  e sy ma w e w b removed  by  the nnouncement, ow postponed ntil  omorrow,  of et a n u t y another  ackage  of olicy  easures.  Because  we do  not  expect nderlying p p m u conditions  n  Japan  to mprove  immediately r  dramatically  d  because e i i o an w anticipate  at  he ffects  f sian  developments ill revent   further th t e o A w p a substantial  pansion f he  Japanese xternal  urpluses  n he  aggregate, ex o t e s i t we have  incorporated to ur  projection ly  a  slight preciation  he  yen/ in o on ap oft dollar  ate rom  its  ecent  evel.  ompared with  our  September  projection, r f r l C we now have  the en  more than  15 percent  eaker  at he nd  of  1999. y w t e

With  respect  o ontinental  rope, e are  no  longer  xpecting t c Eu w e a further  ncrease  n  German official  terest  tes  rior  o he tart i i in ra p t t s of monetary  union,  nd  the arket  appears o e  gradually  oming around  to a m t b c the  same conclusion.  his  has  contributed  he eakness  of he  DM  and T tot w t its ssociated rrencies,  d  we expect hat  ecent  ower xchange  rates a cu an t r l e against  he ollar  ill ersist,    balance,  ver he orecast riod. e  also t d w p on o t f pe W anticipate    our  forecast at  terling ll epreciate mewhat against  he in h s wi d so t dollar  s  U.K.  economic  growth  and  interest  tes  ase ut hat  he anadian a ra e b t t C dollar  ill trengthen  omewhat as  interest  tes  ontinue  o  rise  n anada. w s s ra c t i C

With  respect  o he urrencies  f on-G-10  countries,   articular t t c o n inp in the  Asian  region,  ur  crystal ll  s urkier. he Asian  currencies,  cept o ba i m T ex for hose f  China  and  Hong Kong, have  declined  ubstantially ther er t o s fur ov the  intermeeting  riod. e  are ot  expecting  urther  epreciation, pe W n f d on balance,  rom  the urrent  ighly  epressed evels, r  are e expecting f c h d l no w a recovery. o borrow  a  term  from  the olitics    1884,  I ould  characterize T p of w this  s  a  mugwump a position  ith egard o  the ominal  exchange  rates  f w r t n o these conomies--our  ug is n  one  side f he  fence nd  our  wump  is n e m o o t a o the  other. owever,  real ollar  xchange  rates  f hese ountries ould H d e o t c sh appreciate mewhat due  to  inflation  tes  hat  n  many cases ill pproach so ra t i w a or  exceed  double  digits.

Turning  to  oil  rices,  have  reduced ur  assumption bout  the rice p we o a p of  imported il y  about  $2 per arrel  n  1998 and  1999. Our revised o b b i assumption s ased  on  the  substantial  crease  n  official  EC i b in i OP quotas (which  has  led s  to  boost  ur  projection  PEC u o ofO production  y  900,000 b barrels  er  day  in  1998), he asing--at  ast  or he oment--of  tensions p t e le f t m with  Iraq nd  Iran,  nd  the lowing f lobal  rowth, specially    Asia. a a s o g g e in The  market  appears o ave  adopted  a  more cautious  nterpretation hese t h i of  t developments. lthough  futures  rices  ave  declined, e  implied A p h th downward  adjustment  n  import rices  ver  the orecast riod  s  about alf i p o f pe i h the  size mbodied  in ur  assumption. e believe  hat  he  difference flects e o W t t re primarily  ontinuing  oncerns bout he  availability upply rom  Iraq nd, c c a t of  s f a perhaps,    different  sumption bout he  increase  n  actual  PEC a as a t i O production--in  rticular   Kuwait, audi  Arabia,  nd  the nited rab pa by S a U A Emirates--under e  new quotas. th

In  terms f ur  overall  orecast,  wer  oil  rices,  ourse,  mply  lower o o f lo p ofc i U.S.  inflation.  e  principal pact  on  our  external  orecast  ith espect Th im f isw r to  the ominal  balances:  ur  assumption f ower  oil mport rices n O o l i p translates  to   projected  eduction  n he  value f .S.  oil mports n  1998 in a r i t o U i i and 1999 of bout a $7 billion  year  compared  with  the ovember a N Greenbook.  Lower oil rices  ave  only arginal ffects  n  net  exports  n p h m e o i real erms,  oosting  eal  mports lightly. t b r i s

In  total,  e stimated  rag  from  the xternal  ector  n  the ecember th e d e s i D Greenbook is  about  0.9 ercentage  oint ver  the our uarters  f  1998 and p p o f q o 0.4  percentage  oint uring  1999. As a  rough  approximation, e rag p d th d from  net xports  ould  be  a  bit  ess  han alf  his  mount  in he bsence f e w l t h t a t a o the  effects  he  Asian  crisis d  the eaker  outlook or apan  and  the en, oft an w f J y using he  September  Greenbook as  the asis  or omparison.   would t b f c I caution,  owever,  that  t  ecomes  increasingly  fficult isentangle uses h i b di tod ca and  effects   successive  orecasts. r  example, n he  case f ffects at in f Fo i t o e th are  transmitted rough hird  ountries,  tablishing  e  counterfactual th t c es th assumption s roblematic.  s an  illustration, e  November and i p A in  th December Greenbooks, e've  assumed  progressively  re moderate w mo trajectories  onetary  policies   the ajor  foreign  ndustrial  untries form in m i co as well  as  in he nited tates, d  these ssumptions ave  affected  ur t U S an a h o thinking  bout  the ath or he  dollar.  o doubt  some,  but robably ot  all, a p f t N p n of  these djustments  an  and  should e  attributed    the enerally aker a c b to g we global utlook nd  in  particular    the ffects  f he sian  crisis,  t  it  s o a to e o t A bu i increasingly  nuous o  try o  separate  ut  how much is ue  to evelopments te t t o d d in  Asia  and  how much is ue  to ther  nderlying  actors. d o u f

Some of  the ame qualifications ly  to  the  interpretation s app of alternative  enarios.  or  this  eeting,  e have  updated  and  circulated sc F m w to the  Committee a  "worse  case" cenario  or he lobal conomy in  which  the s f t g e already  eriously fected  sian  economies  experience  eeper  and  more s af A d prolonged ecessions d  less  ecovery  n  their  eal  xchange  rates.  n  this r an r i r e I scenario,  he risis so preads n  a  major  way to  China  and  Hong Kong, t c al s i and  it mpacts ith  greater  erocity   Latin merica, astern urope, nd i w f on A E E a the ountries  n  the rea f he  former  Soviet nion. On our  assumptions, c i a o t U such  a  worse  case ould  further duce he  growth  rate  f .S.  real DP  by w e t o U G about  a  half  ercentage  oint  ext ear nd  about   quarter  oint  n  1999, p p n y a a p i compared  with  the reenbook  forecast, th omparable ffects   other G wi c e on industrial  onomies.  An important  ualification his  nalysis  s hat  t ec q to  t a i t i assumes  that  he uthorities, articular  ose n  the  major  industrial t a in  p th i countries,  uld  respond  under  the  hypothesized  ircumstances  y  taking wo c b appropriate untercylical  tions, imarily  n  the rea f onetary co ac pr i a o m policy--that  ,  hey ould  lower  interest  tes.  s I  noted arlier, is t w ra A e in preparing  ur  Greenbook  forecasts,   have  already  ncorporated o we i assumptions hat  o  in his  irection;   are o  longer ssuming  much t g t d we n a monetary  tightening.  s nother atter,  ome might  argue, o ssume  that Iti a m s t a policymakers ill ct ggressively d  on  a  timely asis  o amp a  global w a a an b t d slowdown in  growth  that  s aving  differential  ects  their onomies. i h eff on ec Policymakers  n  Europe, reoccupied ith he  transition  monetary  union, i p w t to might  be  less  han oised o ake rompt, ecisive  ction.  n the ther t p t t p d a O o hand,  this  lternative  enario  s ne  that  ombines  both ower  inflation  d a sc i o c l an lower  growth,  hich  would  facilitate ing ction,  east  n he rea f w eas a atl i t a o monetary  policy.

MR. PARRY. Ted,  I  have  a  question  bout hina  and  Hong Kong.  In  early 994, a C 1 China  abolished  ts  fficial  reign  xchange  rate,  nd  I  guess hat  roduced  a  depreciation i o fo e a t p of about  40  percent  n  their  urrency.  hat  obviously  ad  an  adverse mpact n  the elative i c T h i o r competitive  osition   Southeast  sian  countries. e real ppreciation  he  Southeast  sian p of A Th a oft A and  Chinese  currencies nce arly 994  and  the  problems n  their  anking ystems ed ast i e 1 i b s l l summer to  depreciation    their  urrencies d  related pital tflows. e  now have  China's of c an ca ou W relative  sition  ery  adversely  ffected   foreign  xchange  developments. hat adjustment  s po v a by e W i likely  o ccur n  China  and  Hong Kong?  China's  urrency s ot onvertible t  I  guess here t o i c i n c bu t could  be  capital ight t  of ong Kong.  In  fact,  e could et   depreciation  oth urrencies. fl ou H w g a ofb c It eems  to e there  s  the ossibility   rather  ignificant ustment  n  these reas,  nd  we do s m i p ofa s adj i a a not  seem to e  focusing  n  that. b o

MR. TRUMAN. That  possibility tainly   ncorporated   the  worse  case  scenario cer isi in we have  laid  ut, hough  the ffect  ay not e  as  big  as  some would  argue  it ould e.  Let e o t e m b c b m go  back  to  one  of our remises. lthough  there  as a  40  percent  djustment  n hina's  fficial y p A w a i C o exchange  rate  n  1994,  most  of  hina's  rade--some  0  percent f t--was  lready  eing i C t 8 o i a b conducted  at he nofficial  change  rate.  So,  although  he  sign ertainly  s right, ,  unlike t u ex t c wa we some commentators, o  not  think  he  depreciation  s a  major  cause  of ll  hese evelopments. d t wa a t d Moreover it  ame in  early 994,  not  in  1997. The Chinese  financial stem  is ery eak and  has c 1 sy v w

many of  the  same problems, f  ot  worse, s  the  financial  stems n  these ther conomies.  The i n a sy i o e important  ifference  hat  he  Chinese  financial stem  is ot  as  integrated to he orld d ist t sy n in t w financial stem  so  it  s ot  a  major  source f xternal akness.  It ay be  a  source f nternal sy i n o e we m o i weakness, ut  one  can  debate hat  oint. learly,  t  s ot  the ame source f xternal  eakness b t p C i i n s o e w that  e find n  some of hese ther  ountries. w i t o c

That  having een  said,  here  ertainly   cope  for ontinuing  apital ight om b t c iss c c fl fr China.  I  know some analysts,  cluding  olleagues  n  my staff,  o estimate  hat  apital ight in c o wh t c fl on  the rder f 10 billion  year robably s ccurring  oday rom  Mainland  China.

In  fact,  t he eetings his an to t y a t m t week in  Kuala  Lumpur they asically id hat  hey  were  not oing  to  devalue heir  xchange b sa t t g t e rate,  ut hey  also ndicated at  hey  were  not oing  to  go  out  of heir  ay to elp eighboring b t i th t g t w h n nations  inancially  y  more than hey lready  ere.  As you  know,  they  have  a  fairly f an t a w comfortable  nternational erve  osition  f ell  over  $130 billion--the est mber that i res p o w lat nu I remember seeing. o,  there  s   risk  here.  Setting  side  he hairman's iew  about he S i a t a t C v t possibility     downward limit  o  declines  n  other sian  exchange  rates, ich  seems  to e ofa t i A wh b right  o  me,  there s   point  t hich  the ompetitive essures  n  China  and  the ifferent t i a a w c pr o d competitive essures  n  Hong Kong would  be  felt.  herefore,    think e cannot ule ut  the pr o T I w r o possibility  at  hat  air f ominoes, o  use  an old  metaphor,  ould  affect  ther sian  economies h t p o d t c o A and  likely ve  a  secondary ipple  ffect  n  the  United tates  nd  other  arts  f he orld. hat ha r e o S a p o t w T

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  will  ot omment n c to  any  degree  on  the conomy of he econd District, ch  actually    little  tter  han t  as e t S whi isa be t i w at  the ime  of ur  last  eeting,  or  on  the  national onomy because e agree ssentially  th t o m n ec w e wi the  viewpoint f he  Greenbook.  Since  I  have  spent   little  re than our ecades  on  the o t a mo f d international e f  things,  thought   would  devote ome comments to y feel or he olitical sid o I I s m f t p and  economic  situation   he orld.  My  views  are ot  significantly similar  om  those hat int w n dis fr t have  just  een  shared. b

It eems  to  me that  he orld  economy is alking  along  a  rather  arrow  ridge. o the s t w w n T right,  have a  pleasantly ward sloping  eadow  and  to  the eft,  rather  arge  recipice. e we up m l a l p Th forecast sentially  s  the  world  economy continuing  o  walk  successfully  ong hat  idge. t s es ha t al t r I i not  very  likely   begin o  enter  he eadow  and  experience  etter  onditions r s t ikely to t t m b c no i i l to fall  nto he recipice.  hat are he  dangers?  If  e look  at  the hree conomies  in  Asia  that i t p W t w t e already  re n  the ands  of he nternational etary  Fund--Korea,  hailand,  nd  Indonesia--we a i h t I Mon T a see  that  ven  though hey re  very  different    many ways,  they ll ave  command  economies  in e t a in a h which  resources  re  allocated  politicians   bureaucrats d  not y  the  marketplace. he a by and an b T tool hat  he  politicians   bureaucrats ve  used  to  allocate sources  as  been  the inancial t t and ha re h f system,  nd  the inancial stems n  all  hese ountries e  extremely  eak. The process  f a f sy i t c ar w o allocating  sources  y  politicians   bureaucrats rough he  banking ystem  means that re b and th t s a country oes  not roduce  good  bankers nd  it  oes  not  produce ood  bank  supervisors. d p a d g However,  the eaders  f hese ountries  ave  had  very  long  records  f  success. ccordingly,  t  s l o t c h o A i i very  difficult  r hem  to  believe  hat  he eadership ey ave  provided,  hich  has  taken fo t t t l th h w advantage  of ome very  real  irtues--such  very  high  saving ates  nd  tremendous  investment s v as r a in  education  hat  ave  created    dedicated, rdworking,  nd  well-educated bor orce--has t h a ha a la f suddenly ecome wrong. They really  ere  not  wrong during hat  ong eriod f uccess. hat b w t l p o s W they  miss  is hat  he orld  has  changed, ust  s  a  number of ears go  the  leaders  f he oviet t t w j a y a o t S Union  missed  that  he  world  had  changed. t

The command  economy simply  does  not  work today  in  a  more integrated rld  with wo very  rapid  echnological velopments. hat  means  that  he eaders  n  those ountries   not t de T t l i c do understand,  ither otionally  r  intellectually, the  new economy in hich  they ust e em o how w m

operate  ow functions.  his  is here  there  s   great  eal f onfusion hat  eads o  equating n T w i a d o c t l t these outheast  sian  situations  th  that  f exico in  1994 and 1995.  The differences e  that S A wi o M ar Mexico has  had  political  adership at  ery  deeply nderstands  ow  a  market conomy le th v u h e behaves; t as  had  the ood  luck  of aving   president o is n  outstanding onomist nd i h g h a wh a ec a understands  arkets ery  well  and, fter    short djustment  eriod,  t as ad an  outstanding m v a a a p i h h finance inister  ho also nderstands  ery  well  how markets ork;  it  as  a  much better,  re m w u v w h mo market-oriented  trepreneurial  ctor  nd  a  population  hat  adly as  had  many centuries en se a t s h of experience  ith  hardship  nd  thus as  the bility   adjust  o his  ew hardship  ith  patience. w a h a to t t n w Therefore,  he  Mexican economy,  with  some very reative  elp rom  the nited tates  nd  the t c h f U S a International etary  Fund,  improved  rather  uickly.  t egan  to  turn pward  in  March and Mon q I b u April  of 995,  within  onths after  he  rescue  ackage  was put nto ffect.    do  not  think  hat  e 1 m t p i e I t w can  have  great onfidence  hat  he  same favorable  utcomes  will revail  n  Korea, hailand,  nd c t t o p i T a Indonesia.

Among  the  other  ountries  n  Southeast  sia, alaysia ertainly s  a  very  similar c i A M c ha economy,  but  I  think  t  s nvolved  n n  advanced  exercise  n enial.  ven countries at  ave i i i i a i d E th h managed themselves  articularly l, ong Kong and  Singapore,  re  being  battered,    the p wel H a as Singapore ollar  as today,  y  people ho view  them as  command  economies.  They  have  been d w b w much better  anaged,  certainly    the ase  of ingapore ith  a  very  high egree f ntegrity m in c S w d o i at the  official  vel, t hey  are  still  garded s ommand  economies  that  ay have  the ame le bu t re a c m s problem  in  adjusting   the eal orld. to r w

The Chinese  leadership,    Ted  Truman suggested, s  thus  far ehaved  extremely as ha b well.  Overnight,  he  spokesman  for iang emin,  the hairman  and  president,  id hat  hey t J Z c sa t t

would  not  devalue heir  urrency. heir ice remier or conomic  management,  Zhu Rongji, t c T v p f e who is  generally  eemed to  be  the remier-to-be,  ovides  ery  effective adership pecially d p pr v le es considering  hat  e  has  lived  ll f is ife  n  a  command  economy that  s  still  der  Communist t h a o h l i i un Party eadership.  e understands  ather  ell  how the  world  economy works. One can  hope  that l H r w China  will  ot  add  to he roblems  by  making  some unfortunate licy  istakes. s President n t p po m A Parry  suggested  n is uestions, e  temptations rtainly  e  there. i h q th ce ar

The major  command  economy in  Asia  is hat  f apan.  It s fter  ll he apanese t o J i a a t J model that  orea  followed. apan  basically s  the  same structural  oblem: esources  are K J ha pr R allocated  y  bureaucrats d  politicians. b an one  has  to ope  that  ertain  teps  ill e  taken hat  ecognize  hat  he  way they ave  been h c s w b t r t t h managing their  conomy may have  been  grand  for   while,  ut  it o  longer orks. e a b n w

If e were  to  have  a  continuing  ontagion  rom  Asia,   think  t s ery  likely,  ain s w c f I i i v ag a suggested y  President  arry  in  his uestion  nd  Ted  Truman in is  answer, hat  he  next ountry b P q a h t t c about  which  one  would have  to  worry  is razil.  he Brazilian al  s vervalued  n  the xchange B T re i o i e markets; he anking  sector  s xtremely eak;  and  the olitical  stem s  not unctioning ll t b i e w p sy i f we except hen there  s  a  feeling  mong the oliticians t  hey  are  about o  be  infected  y  Asia. w i a p tha t t b After ome improvement  in  facing  eality  couple f eeks ago  when the  Asian  flu eemed s r a o w s particularly  rulent,  ere  ppears o  have  been  a  return  o olitics    usual. ortunately,  azil vi th a t t p as F Br has  a  very ood  government  team  at he evels  f he resident,  e inance  inister,  d  the g t l o t p th f m an central  ank  governor. rgentina ontinues  o o well,  ut ecause f  its  ercosur  involvement, b A c t d b b o M it  ould  not e  able o ithstand    shock  from  Brazil. w b t w a

That  situation   xacerbated  omewhat  by  the ost  recent  llness  resident  eltsen. ise s m i ofP Y The leadership at  e normally hare ith  Europe  is dversely  ffected,  ough  one  should th w s w a a th not  overstate is,   the  fact  hat  hey re  heading nto  he  most  crucial  ix-month eriod  or he th by t t a i t s p f t creation  f he uro.

Therefore,  t ould  appear hat  e have  a  world  that  s ot ikely  o lide  nto he i w t w i n l t s i t precipice,  t  that  isk  s ery onsiderable.   my view, hat  would  bring bout  such  a  slide bu r i v c In w a would  be  the mplosion f he  financial stems n  some of  the sian  countries,    happened  in  a i o t sy i A as number of ell-developed  conomies  in  the  1930s.

Regarding   couple f he etails,  neral etail  d  service-sector a o t d ge r an activity cked p sharply  n  November according  o  our  latest nthly  survey.

apparently  re  resulting    some buildup  n  wage pressures   at  least  ome sectors  f he a in i in s o t regional  conomy,  especially  nstruction  d  retail.  pically, asonal  orkers  earn he e co an Ty se w t minimum wage on average uring he  holiday eason. hey are  now making  $6.00  an  hour  or d t s T even  more in  some cases.

Turning  to  the  national cture, ave  to  say  that    found  the brupt  evisions  he pi I  h I a r int Greenbook  projections  rprising,   east  heir  xtent.  ctually, is  onth's eal rowth  and su atl t e A th m r g inflation  recasts e ot  all hat  ifferent  om  last  onth's. ut  in  this  reenbook,  the fo ar n t d fr m B G moderation n  the  rate f eal DP  growth  and  the ontainment  f nflation  ke lace ithout i o r G c o i ta p w any  tightening  onetary  policy.  n  the ovember Greenbook,   significant  ghtening s ofm I N a ti wa assumed  to  occur ver he  course f  1998. I  understand,  ourse,  hat  his  hange  reflects  e o t o ofc t t c th potential gative  allout   Asian  problems  on  the .S.  economy,  but  it  s ot t ll lear  o e ne f of U i n a a c t m from  the iscussion   the reenbook  that  n erms  of he ost  likely  utcome  recent d in G i t t m o developments ave  changed  the utlook  s  substantially he rojections  dicate. h o a as  t p in

Let  me make four bservations out  this  ery  quickly.  First,  ur  November o ab v ato meeting  I  expressed  oncern hat  he idespread iew  in inancial rkets hat  ed  policy  as c t t w v f ma t F w on  hold, t  least  or  he ime eing,  as preventing  ong-term  nterest  tes  rom  playing  heir a f t t b w l i ra f t usual  automatic  tabilizer e. n  my view,  the arket  reaction  o he ovember employment s rol I m t t N reports  as  very  strong  vidence or  his  oint f iew  and  this  oncern. hat  report  as much w e f t p o v c T w stronger  han xpected. he strength  as across he oard, nd  the eport  ncluded  n  hourly t e T w t b a r i a increase  n  wages that  as well bove  any  reasonable  rojection  roductivity  ins. he i w a p ofp ga T markets ardly eacted  t  all. t ppears ow that  he arkets hink he  only hing hat  ill ake h r a I a n t m t t t t w m us  react  s   fairly bstantial  mp  in  CPI  inflation.  th  labor arkets s  tight   they re, i a su ju Wi m a as a I

think his  bsence f he  usual tabilizer hanism coming from  long-term  nterest  tes  s  a t a o t s mec i ra i significant  side isk  n he utlook,  nd  I  believe  hat  eeds  to  be  given onsiderable ight up r i t o a t n c we along  with  whatever eight  we give  to he  Asian  problem. w t

Second,  a  key  element n  the reenbook's ew projections  he  estimate  hat  he i G n ist t t Asian  crisis ll ouble  the ecline  n  U.S.  net xports  n  1998 from  what  was projected   the wi d d i e i in November Greenbook and  that et xports  ill educe  real  DP  growth  by  about ne  percentage n e w r G o point ext  year.  I  don't  now exactly  ow that  stimate  as arrived  t.  More importantly, o n k h e w a I  d not  have  a  clear  ense f hat  the taff uld  say  about he onfidence  nterval ound  that s o w s wo t c i ar estimate.    think  t ould  be  helpful  o now that, ven he xtent  f he  changes n  the I i w t k gi t e o t i projections,  though ed's nswer  to  my question  elps o ut  a  little  re of   quantitative al T a h t p mo a dimension  on it.  he basic oint s hat  et  exports  learly esent  ownside  risks, t e need T p i t n c pr d bu w to  be  careful  ot o  overstate em  when weighing  them  against  ther  isks  hat  e face n he n t th o r t w i t outlook. or  all f he alk  bout  globalization,    U.S.  economy is till  lf-contained    a  very F o t t a the s se to considerable tent. x

Third,  he  flip  ide f he rospective dening  of he  U.S.  current  ccount eficit t s o t p wi t a d isa widening  capital count  surplus.  he Asian  crisis,    I hink e all  now,  has  redirected  pital ac T as t w k ca flows way from  emerging  economies  back  toward  industrial  onomies, specially  e  U.S. a ec e th economy. This  is ertainly  rt f  the eason or he ecent  eclines  n ond  rates  n .S. c pa o r f t r d i b i U markets,  nd  I hink t  as  helped o ncrease  oanable  unds t anks.  In  short, e apital a t i h t i l f a b th c reflow hat  s  occurring  as  some of he ffects  f n  easing f onetary  policy.    don't  hink  he t i h t e o a o m I t t Greenbook  mentions his, d  I  wonder  whether  the rojections  ke ccount f t. t an p ta a o i

Finally, ile  the ppreciation   the  dollar  bviously  ill educe  export  emand,  that wh a of o w r d effect  ill e  partially  fset  y  the estraining  fects  he  dollar's  preciation    prices.  he w b of b r ef oft ap on T better  nflation  rformance ill  olster al age gains n  the .S.  economy and  probably i pe w b e w i U increase  ousehold onfidence  hat  hose age gains ill ontinue. hat  could  well eep h c t t w w c T k consumption  expenditures  an above-trend  ath nd  add  further  he  tightness   labor on p a tot in markets.

In  short, ile vents n  Asia  obviously  re  serious  nd  present  ignificant  wnside wh e i a a s do risks, e pside isks  hat  ere  in  the utlook efore he  Asian  crisis erged  have  not th u r t w o b t em disappeared.  e  should ot  discount  hem  in ur  assessment f he utlook.  hank you.

Turning  to he  national  cene,  e had  prepared ur  own forecast ior  o  receiving e t s w o pr t th Greenbook. Our assessment  or DP  growth  in  1998 was in  the  area f .8  percent, llowing f G o 2 fo growth  of bout  4  percent  n  the ourth  uarter  f  1997. We  had  unemployment trending  own a i f q o d by  year-end 998 and  the ore PI  trending  p,  even  after  djustments  ere  made for 1 c C u a w measurement  changes.  Obviously,  n  terms  of road  trends  his  s uite  ifferent  om  the i b t i q d fr Greenbook scenario  hough  it  s n  line  ith  several ivate  orecasts.   preparing  his  orecast, t i i w pr f In t f

we incorporated tween  .50 nd  .75  percentage  oint f egative  mpact  on  GDP  as  a  result be a p o n i of the  Asian  crisis d  a  few  tenths  ore reflecting  r  expectations    general  lowdown in he an m ou ofa s t domestic  economy. The result  hat e had  projected    bit  ess  f   slowdown in  GDP  growth ist w a l o a than  the  Greenbook.

When  I  looked  at he reenbook forecast is  eekend to  assess  he  progressively t G h w t gloomier sian  prospects, ould  accept he  Greenbook  estimates  f he ffects  f he xternal A I  c t o t e o t e situation.  wever,  I  am more agnostic  bout he  impact f maller  dditions   inventories  d Ho a t o s a to an the  gradual ecline  n  stock arket rices, th  of hich  contribute   a  Greenbook  GDP  outlook d i m p bo w to that  s ell  below  our  forecast  oston.

MR. STERN. Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman. The  District onomy continues  o  grow at ec t a  healthy  ace  as  usual.    will ot well n  much of hat  n  detail;    s ot n  unfamiliar ory. p I n d o t i iti n a st We  recently  ad  a  couple f eetings ith  business  eaders, d  I  would  say  the  general h o m w l an information  leaned t hose eetings ndicated   major  surprises. siness eople re g a t m i no Bu p a uniformly ositive out  the  1998 outlook.  onstruction  s   particularly ght  ector.  hey p ab C i a bri s T clearly  xpect conomic  growth  to ontinue.  ll  in  all,   ould  say  the orecast  enerally e e c A Iw f isg favorable.  t s  also lear  ow,  at east   our  region,  hat  age pressures ve  become pervasive I i c n l in t w ha both  geographically d  by  job nd  skill tegories.  s ery,  ery  hard o  find orkers, nd an a ca Iti v v t w a

there re  more reports  f arger  age increases.  ome business  eople elieve  hat  hey an a o l w S p b t t c offset  he igher  ages with  productivity  provements  or  other  ctions.  ome  say  that  hey t h w im a S t expect rofit  argins  to  be  squeezed n  1998  and  presumably eyond.  That  was the eneral p m i b g thrust  f he ommentary at hose eetings.  All  in  all,  he istrict  onomy continues  o o t c t m t D ec t perform  very  nicely.

As far  as  the ational  conomy is oncerned,  y view  is hat  he isks  re  on  the n e c m t t r a downside  at  this  tage. ut  in aking  that  tatement, ould  not  start th he urrent s B m s I  w wi t c Greenbook  forecast.  f  e compare  that  orecast th,  ay, hat  n he eptember  Greenbook, e I w f wi s t i t S w do  not ave  any  tightening  olicy n he urrent  reenbook  in  contrast  he  staff sumption h ofp i t c G ot as in  September.  While  I ertainly  cognize  hat  sia  and  its  epercussions  present  significant c re t A r re a shock  that  as not nticipated    September, e also ave  had  more  sustained  ggregate  emand w a in w h a d than  was anticipated.    now have  tighter bor arkets.  We  have  an  economy that  isplays We la m d a good  deal f omentum.  So,  if   ere  going  to rite own a  baseline  orecast sed  on  all  f o m Iw w d f ba o this,   ould  put n  more real  rowth  and  more inflation  an s n  the reenbook. Iw i g th i i G

Against hat  ackground,    think  he isks  re  on  the ownside.  I ay  that  ecause f t b I t r a d s b i the  Greenbook  is ight  hat  here  ill e  no  appreciable celeration    inflation,   if    am right r t t w b ac in and I that  age pressures  re  now pervasive, ich  is retty  ell aked  in he ake, hen  it  eems  to w a wh p w b t c t s me that  he mplications    at east  he isks  or rofit rgins,  tock rices, d  ultimately al t i or l t r f p ma s p an re activity  e  on  the ownside. ar d

My  own hunches  are hat  he  domestic conomy may prove  stronger  nd  more t t e a resilient n  the  Greenbook  suggests, d  others  round  the able  ave  voiced hat  eeling. tha an a t h t f I sense hat e now have  some momentum  in  wage increases, pecially    the ow end  of he t w es at l t wage spectrum,  nd  I'm ot  sure hat  eclining flation  tters hat  uch for age increases. a n t d in ma t m w We  may have  achieved he  Chairman's efinition   rice tability:  ccurs hen inflation  es t d ofp s It o w do not  play nto  usiness  nd  consumer  calculations.  lso m more skeptical an  the taff at  he i b a I  a a th s th t minimum  wage has  had  a  lot  o o  with  the age increases at  e have  seen.  I'm ore  inclined t d w th w m to  attribute  e ncreases   tight  abor  arkets.  If hat  s rue,  he bsence f nother inimum th i to l m t i t t a o a m wage increase  oing  forward ill ot  have  as  much of   restraining ect  s  the taff ems  to g w n a eff a s se anticipate. lso hink  e could  see  health  ost ncreases  dding ore to abor  osts han  the I  a t w c i a m l c t Greenbook predicts,  ough  we have  not  seen hat appen  yet. specially  ith  somewhat higher th t h E w wages,  consumer  spending ay prove  stronger  han s rojected  n  the reenbook.  I  am a  little m t i p i G skeptical  f   significant  gative  ealth ffect  f  he tock arket  does  what  we all  ope  it  ill o a ne w e i t s m h w do,  namely, eflect al arnings  rospects  ompany by  company and  drift  own at   moderate r re e p c d a rate.  hat  kind f utcome  may not ave  a  major  negative  ealth ffect.  here  also ay be  a T o o h w e T m little  re momentum  in  business  nvestment  han  the taff  stimating.  would  not  expect, mo i t s ise I however,  that    slightly  ronger  conomy would  give  us  significantly her  nflation.  eaper a st e hig i Ch imports,  ncluding  he lood f oods  we will  e  getting  rom  Asia, re  certainly  ing  to old i t f o g b f a go h down price  ncreases,  d  productivity  owth  may hold  up  a  little  tter an  the reenbook i an gr be th G suggests.

I, oo,  m mystified  y  the  deflation estion  hat  e get very  time  we make a t a b qu t w e speech.  I  have  concluded,  nlike  d Boehne,  that  he uestion  hould ot e  taken oo  seriously. u E t q s n b t That's  ecause hen I  ask  those ho pose  the  question  hat  they eally  ean by  it,    often o b w w w r m I d not  get   very ood  answer.  They may have  in ind something hey ead  on  the ront  age  of a g m t r f p the  Wall  Street  ournal hat  ounds  like   good  question  o  ask   speaker rom  the ederal J t s a t a f F Reserve.  The prospect  hat  rices  ctually  ill o  down in  the  face f hat  we normally ee  as t p a w g o w s continuing  trength  n  the conomy strikes  as  bizarre. s i e me

On the  foreign  ront too,  hought ill  cDonough's analysis  as extremely ogent. f I, t B M w c

I  spent   week a in  Europe  listening   he emarks  of apanese inance  inistry  nd  central  ank  officials tot r J f m a b concerning hat  they re  going  to  do  about heir  conomy.

MR. MEYER. Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  The forecast  hich  policy  ust  respond tow m is ow being  shaped  by  three  owerful orces.  he first  he  strong  yclical turn ver  the ast n p f T ist c up o l two  years. he second  is he iverse  et f actors--some mbination f emporary nfluences T t d s o f co o t i and  longer-lasting uctural  anges--that  ve  restrained  flation  d  resulted    virtual str ch ha in an ina disconnect  etween  the eal  ector  nd  the age/price  ector.  he new ingredient,  so b r s a w s T al threatening   be  a  powerful layer n ts  wn right,  he  Asian  turmoil.  n  terms f onetary to p i i o ist I o m policy,  e mainly  have  watched  as he irst o  forces  ave  battled   a  near raw.  We  have w t f tw h to d remained  alert  nd  asymmetric  to e  sure,  ut ostly nmoved. Our  inaction  as  been  rewarded a b b m u h with  exceptional croeconomic  performance. owever,  the  further cline  n  the ma H de i unemployment rate ver  the ast wo  months  and  the  evidence f rowth  at  a  pace  still  ll o p t o g we above  trend  n  this  uarter  ave  begun, n y judgment,  o ilt e alance oward  policy  ction i q h i m t t th b t a to  lean gainst  he yclical nds, otwithstanding  e  continued  xcellent flation  rformance. a t c wi n th e in pe

Simply  put, n  economy growing  at  a  pace  near   percent  nd  operating  t   4.6 a 4 a a a percent  nemployment  rate eserves  o ave  a  little  nd  thrown  into  ts  heels.

How  much monetary ightening uld be Th t a t wo required  o  yield  he ame slowing n  growth  over he ext wo years s  the  staff w expects t t s i t n t a no from  the sian  turmoil? etween  the  September  and  the ecember Greenbooks, he  forecast r A B D t fo growth  over  1998  was revised  ownward by  almost   full  ercentage  oint nd  over  1999  by  1/2 d a p p a percentage  oint. he September  forecast  n  this  omparison s djusted  o eflect e  same p T i c i a t r th monetary  policy ssumptions s  in  December.

This  tightening p t ov D is estimated  o  slow  growth  0.3  percentage  oint  ver  1998  and  0.7 ercentage  oint  ver  1999. t p o p p o The dynamics  of he wo shocks  are uite ifferent. vertheless,  is  omparison uggests  hat t t q d Ne th c s t the  effects  f he sian  turmoil  ight  easily  atch  or xceed  the uter  nd  of ny  monetary o t A m m e o e a policy  ightening  might  have  contemplated  ver  the ext ear.  That  is   lot f and o  throw t we o n y a o s t into he  wheels  of he conomy.

The next  questions  re hether he taff y have  overestimated e  spillover  om a w t s ma th fr the  Asian  crisis  nderestimated e  momentum oru th in  the conomy in  the bsence f  an  Asian e a o shock.

While  I  still vor  o vo t w in A fa n change  this  onth,  my reasoning  as  changed.  On the ne  hand, vents n  Southeast  sia  have m h o e i A become much more worrisome.

MR.  MCTEER. Okay. He did  not ention  the  role f he  IMF,  and  I hought   would m o t t I ask  him about hat  nd  you, r.  Chairman,  as  well.  I  know that  he MF does  a  lot  o  promote t a M t I t movement toward  market  mechanisms  in  command  economies, nd  they o  a  lot  o  bring a d t government  policymakers  ut  of  an  attitude   enial.  ut  it  lso eems  that  MF officials o ofd B a s I

They have  a  root anal heory f he  way to  get  out o a wh t c t o t of  difficult  tuations    canceling  rojects d so  forth.  f ne  watches NN si by p an I o C frequently,  e on sees  a  lot f sian  people n  the treet lking  bout ow they  are  going o  do  their  atriotic  ty o A o s ta a h t p du and  stop  spending oney. m It eems  to  me that  here  s   psychology hat  resupposes  hat  he s t i a t p t t way out  of his  roblem  situation   o  stop pending. t s ard  to  save our  way to  prosperity t p ist s I i h y in an  environment f ollapsing gregate  emand. I  wonder what  we really  hink bout  the  role  f o c ag d t a o the  IMF in  all f his. o t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I  think  he MF has  pulled  ack  a  good  deal rom  some t I b f of  its  revious tatements.  n  addition,  ere as  been  a  lot f alk  uggesting  hat  mplicit  he p s I th h o t s t i int IMF agreement ith  Korea  is   3 percent  rowth  limit.  uch a  limit  oes  not  exist. here  is w a g S d T a series  f ecommendations ith  respect  o olicy,  hich  essentially  st  n  the ssue  f o r w t p w re o i o disbanding  he  dirigiste-type  ctivities,    command  economies  that  he ice  Chair as t of  a the t V w talking  bout,  nd  a  series  f ther  ypes f eregulatory,  rket-opening  ype nitiatives  m a a o o t o d ma t i fro which  the MF  forecasts at  he rowth  would  be 3  percent. ut  there  s o  directive   the I th t g B i n on issue  f rowth. o g

The interest  te  ssue  s lso oteworthy.   think here  s   recognition at  hen we ra i i a n I t i a th w have  a  degree f nstability xchange  rates, ich  suggests  ery  rapid hanges n  expectations, o i in  e wh v c i small  increases   the  annual ate  f nterest  e oing  to  be  overwhelmed  by  changes  in in r o i ar g exchange  rates.  ou will ecall at  n  1992  the wedes tried  o  curb   run  on  their  xchange ate Y r th i S t a e r by  raising eir  vernight  nterest  te  o 00  percent.  hey discovered  hat  hen they ivided th o i ra t 5 T t w d that  ate  y  365, he  daily  nterest  te  as small elative    the luctuations y ere r b t i ra w r to f the w experiencing  n  their  xchange  rates.    believe  hat  esson  s nderstood  y  the MF at his  tage. i e I t l i u b I t s

The  issue eally  s ot  about aising  nterest  tes  or he urpose  of ffecting e xchange  rate. r i n r i ra f t p a th e It s ssentially  alancing  f arket  forces  nd  an  effort   keep  the oney  supply rom i e a  b o m a o m f growing  too  fast  nd  potentially endering ndermining nflationary ssures. a eng u i pre

So,  I  do  question  he MF and  their ndency o se  language elating   this  outheast t I te t u r to S Asian  set f  actions  hat  ounds  very imilar   that  sed  to  describe  ctions  aken o  counter  he o t s s to u a t t t inflationary,  ernment-debt  ype  of roblems  in  Latin merica  to  which  that  anguage as gov t p A l w applicable. rtunately,  en we look  at  the etails  hat  the MF is oing  in  Southeast  sia, Fo wh d ofw I d A it urns ut o  be  significantly s  hat ind f ssue. he  IMF is ealing  ith  a  different  gime t o t les t k o i T d w re from  that  ssociated th  the roblems  in  Latin merica. a wi p A

While a m o m o there  re  hints  n  the pending ide f  some slackening  n  demand,  this a o s s o i

In  fact,  ond  yields  re wi ra e t y b a noticeably  ower  than hey  have  been  for ome time--including  tes  n l t s ra o corporate  onds  despite    slight se  n isk  remia.  Although  much of he b a ri i r p t decline n  longer-term  nterest  tes  ince arlier  is  ear s robably i i ra s e th y i p accounted or y lower  inflation  pectations,  al ond  rates  ikely e  no f b ex re b l ar higher han  they ere  over ecent  uarters,  d  they ould e lower. quity t w r q an c b E prices  emain  near he uch higher evels  eached ver  the  spring nd r t m l r o a summer, holding own the  cost f apital  nd  boosting  ealth. nd we see d o c a w A no  signs f dditional ution  y  banks  and  other  enders  n dvancing o a ca b l i a credit.  he ample  availability redit  nd  liquidity   eflected   obust T of  c a isr inr growth  of ate  n road  measures  of oney.

I  believe    have  become something f   resident eologian   the  meaning  of I o a h on symmetry and  asymmetry. We  have  been  using symmetry since he ay meeting  essentially a t M to
