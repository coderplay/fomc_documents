December 11 Session

Good morning, everyone.  As I reported last time, following continuing a review of the leaks that we saw earlier in order to recommend further steps.  This process is ongoing.  I understand they have I understand is very I appreciate that.  The first item on our agenda today is 'Financial Market Operations.'  Let me turn the floor over to Simon. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. our rules, Bill English and Scott Alvarez are this year some interviews this week while people are here.  I thank everyone for what good cooperation; Developments and Open

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Over the intermeeting period, and U.S. elections, investor attention turned to the approaching and its possible implications for economic growth.  Despite some related and global equity indexes generally rose, despite ongoing economic growth. MR. POTTER. 1 especially following the 'fiscal cliff' volatility in financial markets early in the period, investors appear somewhat confident that a compromise avoiding more severe outcomes will be attained, though perhaps not until the New Year.  With advanced-economy central banks expected to continue pursuing highly accommodative policy in the months ahead, sovereign debt yields trended lower concerns about interest yield and the yield remains 14 basis points lower on the period, and at 1.6 percent three-month range. Exhibit 1 begins with a depiction of broad trends in advanced-economy rate and equity markets over the period.  As seen in the upper-left panel, the increased focus on the fiscal cliff led to notable declines in the 10-year Treasury S&amp;P 500 index following the presidential election.  Some of the equity market decline may also be due to investor selling in advance of higher anticipated capital gains tax rates.  Concerns regarding more-severe fiscal tightening outcomes appear to have receded.  While the S&amp;P 500 has now retraced much of its earlier losses, the 10-year Treasury is at the lower end of its

As seen in the upper-right panel, 10-year sovereign yields across a are lower over the period, reflecting a mixture of concerns about well as expectations for a continuation of highly accommodative economic growth; and the passing of key equity indexes 6 percent higher on the period.

A number of special factors this year may be causing January relative to December bills.  First, as discussed Deposit Insurance' in Tealbook A, many year-end expiration of the FDIC's unlimited guarantee on accounts fiscal policy may also anticipated end of the extension program, or MEP, could also put downward pressure on money repo transactions and close substitutes, including The bottom-left panel touches on expectations for money market conditions around the and February bills to trade at low rates in the box 'Expiration of Unlimited FDIC investors believe that the noninterest-bearing transaction accounts could lead to outflows from these and into money market instruments.  The potential for tighter be affecting early-2013 bill rates, because spending cuts and higher tax rates could reduce the government's short-term funding needs.  Lastly, the maturity market rates.  The end of dealer purchases of short-dated Treasuries in the MEP, which tend to be financed in the repo market, could lead to reduced demand for repo funding and a decline in rates for bills.

This situation repo rates alone should warrant Before moving to Desk operations, I would like to discuss effect on money markets.  As seen in the bottom-right panel, interdealer MBS and Treasury sought to lock in funding early.  Rates remained staffing declined to more typical levels.  In contrast, rates in the federal little affected.  Under the current directive, the Desk believed that the effective federal funds rate would move above 25 basis points in the absence of such operations.

Under the MEP, the Desk has purchased just over $635 billion of longer-term Treasury securities and sold or allowed to redeem without reinvestment a slightly larger amount.  If directed to complete the MEP, we would have just purchase operations to complete before the end of completion of of all outstanding securities in the compared with about 15 percent before the crisis (as seen in the security maturing within 3 years. The MEP operations have resulted in a significant shift in SOMA holdings of Treasury securities in different maturity sectors, increasing the average duration of the portfolio.  As shown in the upper-left panel, SOMA holdings at the MEP (the dark blue bars) will stand at 35 percent 10- to 30-year sector, red bars), and we will have sold out of nearly every If the FOMC directed the Desk to continue Treasury purchases in January, the staff would propose a purchase distribution with an average duration of approximately 9 years, which is the net duration of the MEP sales and purchases.

As described assesses that a through 2013 is unlikely see in the top-right panel, the size of settlements increased from $27 billion under the reinvestment program to $64 increase, these settlements went smoothly.  Of the expected settlements in December, to date, about $9 billion have been moved out to January through dollar operations.  Though this monthly dollar roll amount is our highest since reinvestments began, it represents about 10 percent well within the range of size of our settlements, we are monitoring indicators of the implied financing rates on expected scarcity of year-end, along with Implied financing rates for the coupon, where we conducted dollar rolls this month, have been more Given the increase in the market functioning closely.  One such indicator is newly produced MBS, which measure, among other things, the these securities for settlement.  As shown in the middle-left panel, the implied financing rates for December and January settlement of the Fannie Mae 3 percent coupon-the main production coupon-have moderated.  This could partly be due to financial institutions' desire to manage balance sheet ahead of higher-than-anticipated origination volumes contributing to an increase in the supply of MBS available for settlement in December. 3.5 percent negative, likely reflecting the fact that production in this coupon has begun to wane. If widespread strains were to emerge in production coupons, the Desk is prepared to respond by increasing dollar roll activity to facilitate settlement.

However, MBS option-adjusted spreads on the main production coupon have retraced somewhat in recent weeks, as shown in the middle-right panel, with

In the near term, all dealers expect additional Treasury purchases to continue after the conclusion of the MEP, and almost all assume purchases a pace of $45 billion.  MBS purchases are expected to continue at a $40

And then the lighter blue, which you only have two recent observations on because we only just started to ask this question, captures uncertainty around that point estimate and gives separate out disagreement about how things might evolve in point expectations from uncertainty in terms of the average level of uncertainty that dealers have.  If we had a longer history of the balance sheet question, we could see whether this sheet. 12 months ahead is relatively high compared 2007, 2008-quite turbulent times.

If I this meeting, I think that what you'd see is that 18 of the dealers are at dealers who are a little bit below $45 billion, and that might be a different view of the purchase allocation.

I will be referring to the handout labeled 'Options for Continuation of Open-Ended Asset Purchases in 2013.' Committee received a memo from the staff providing projections of the effects of additional asset purchases on the economic outlook as well as the balance sheet and income.  I will discuss the various options we considered, how we modeled these programs, and their effects on the macroeconomy; Julie Remache, from the Desk, will continue the presentation by discussing the effect of these programs on the will focus on three purchase program options, as your first exhibit.

In the memo, we also exit.  For example, if the interest rate paid on Federal Reserve liabilities was to exceed the interest rate on excess reserves, interest expense could be larger than what is assumed in the projections covered thus far. prompt a A partial-equilibrium analysis of these two cumulative remittances by made regarding exit.  As noted by Jane, the results the exit strategy principles laid out in June 2011.  Using our five-year sale pace for MBS, the larger purchase program will not normalize the end of the three-year window noted in that strategy. a Finally, in addition to the uncertainty regarding rates, income projections are highly dependent on assumptions presented here reflect assumed the size of the portfolio by The portfolio has evolved considerably since June 2011, and the Committee may at some point wish to revisit this exit strategy.  While the memo does not undertake full assessment of alternative strategies to normalize the portfolio and the balance sheet, we do provide an illustrative example in which the portfolio is reduced only through redemptions, without the use of sales.

in a 'No Sales' scenario program, compared with the staff's standard exit assumptions. year longer to remittances to the Treasury are higher in the medium term.  In total, are boosted by $50 billion as the elimination of realized billion.  Again, this example is could be altered. The bottom-left panel shows the path of SOMA holdings under a $1.25 trillion With no sales (the solid green line), it takes just a little more than a reach the steady-state size of the portfolio, and, as shown in the bottom-right panel, annual cumulative remittances capital losses and the added coupon income from retaining the MBS more than offset the added interest expense of higher reserves before the portfolio is normalized. Indeed, the peak deferred asset in this case is just $6 just one of the ways in which the exit strategy models indicate that additional asset purchases will boost and inflation moderately.  The programs will also significantly effects of additional and on our balance sheet.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Jane are happy to take questions. To summarize, the staff aggregate real activity increase the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, which affects income.  All the projections, of course, rely on many assumptions and are subject to uncertainty, but our hope is that these projections provide some sense of the purchases on the economy and I

Thank you, and let the work on this memo.  This effects on the balance sheet.  They went hold.  It was a lot of effort, and we appreciate the work.  Obviously we'll have plenty of time to discuss these issues more broadly, but at this point, does presenters?  Governor Duke.

one question, and you may not have the answer with you in your you mentioned that the deferred asset would still be larger than the capital.  What Where would they be? MS. DUKE.  I just have notes, but about the unrealized losses in the portfolio?

on the scenario you look at.  For example, in the very extreme losses of more than $300 billion.  That's going to be greater than our for option 1 and option 3-go ahead, Julie. MS. IHRIG.  It depends case, we have unrealized capital stock, but would be approximately $200 billion under a $500 billion program. MS. REMACHE.  They program and $240 billion under a $1 trillion

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Assuming what interest rate scenario?

a little bit we looked at in the memo, and those peaks occur sometime in about MS. REMACHE.  These are revised under the Tealbook scenario, which is more favorable than what mid-2016.

IHRIG.  Total capital stock around that time is $100 billion.

I have a two-hander? VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Can

go ahead.

MR. POTTER.  That would be above capital.

MS. REMACHE.  Yes.

MS.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes,

December 11-12, 2012

I would imagine that we've had many early 1980s. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  But in the past periods of time where the capital losses on the portfolio were far bigger than our capital-for example, back in the of those of the size of the portfolio at that time.  Our projections are similar to MS. REMACHE.  That's right.  We did some preliminary looking at some figures and found that in the early 1980s, the unrealized loss position on the portfolio was approximately 7 percent that but just a bit larger.

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So they're comparable.

MS. REMACHE.  Yes.

guess these capital are offsetting the remittances that we are now sending to the Treasury.  In the would be larger CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sorry to interject one other thing.  I losses, of course, last four years, we have sent $280 billion to the Treasury, and obviously they over the lifetime of the security.

MR. POTTER.  These are the unrealized ones.

yes. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Unrealized, your SOMA portfolio to be at least as large as your your big liability and which is more than $1 trillion right now. actually recognize all of those unrealized losses. MS. IHRIG.  Also, one important point to make is that we would never sell the entire portfolio.  You would want the size of currency in circulation, which is You would never

Let me add that if we considered the amount of the portfolio that is in currency at the time of these losses, under the $500 billion scenario we of that is associated with MS. REMACHE. excess of the level of project unrealized losses to peak at about $240 billion, but $130 billion the portfolio that is larger than currency.

The model includes equations for tax revenues, tax rates, and Those factors are all endogenous with the state average tax rate that's personal income tax received by households going forward.  The growing stronger, you would have the tax base causing tax revenues to rise relative to the baseline.  In addition, there's of average tax rates to the state of the economy.  For instance, if the getting higher personal capital gains and things like that that tries to model the endogeneity of tax revenues and the MR.

The model starts off with our baseline assumption for the going to be applied to the scenarios then assume that if the economy was increasing more rapidly a certain sensitivity economy is doing better, you're boost the average tax rate.  So the model state of the business cycle.

Yes.  It's based on the Treasury's actual success in collecting MS. RASKIN.  So it takes a haircut for the lack of ability to collect fully? MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. revenues, and not based on some hypothetical collection experience.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.

I'd like to seek clarification on, following up on first page on the pace of shrinking the balance sheet MR. PLOSSER.  I have two questions the remittances and on charts 5 and 6, about the difference in the pace of sales and how that affects remittances.  I want to go back to the

December 11-12, 2012

SOMA sales and how the 'No Sales' options of the green lines on charts 5 and 6 translate charts, if at all.  How would it on the into behaviors of both unemployment and inflation in those change those charts?

IHRIG.  If we don't do sales, then we would think that the SOMA portfolio is larger we're not putting duration back into the MS. for a longer period of time.  This scenario means public's hands, which would imply we would keep holding interest rates down for a longer period of time.

inflation MR. PLOSSER.  And how will that show up in the unemployment and the charts?

IHRIG.  That's a little harder because I would think if you're not doing sales, then fed funds rate will lift off as well because that would also MS. you might want to consider when the feed into the macroeconomy.

MR. PLOSSER.  It's hard to make a translation between these charts 5 and 6, which look like small changes, into what they might look like in the previous charts.

MR. ENGLISH.  I think it's fair to say that the effects on inflation and unemployment would be relatively small.

MR. PLOSSER.  Why?

the effect on our usual calculations of term premium effects is larger by a relatively modest amount out in works on term effect on the macroeconomy would MR. ENGLISH.  Because would be relatively small.  This balance sheet 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020.  And those effects, just the way the modeling premiums today, would be relatively small, and therefore the be expected to be relatively small.

December 11-12, 2012

Two other things.  First, Bill's point is exactly right.  Secondlater in the decade the funds rate is moving that the balance sheet was additional stimulus out toward the second half of the decade, the funds rate would the stimulus from the balance sheet.  This full confidence in the Fed doing you were this way or not, but in terms of looking at figure 5 in the second exhibit, if you renormalization out further was going to worry a lot of people, then you effects on inflation that aren't taken account of in this scenario. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. getting back to the point that Jane raised-out there in response to changes in economic conditions.  To the extent providing any be somewhat higher, which would tend to offset outcome is conditional, the way we run it, on people having what needs to be done for stabilizing inflation, and so on.  I don't know whether thinking about it thought that pushing could have expectational

I remember correctly, the root mean squared error on the one-quarter-ahead unemployment rate was it was about 80 basis points.  So how do I think about the model that is making years out?  How do I think about putting these two memos together it might or might not be? MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you.  I have one other question that is kind of related to that.  We had a memo from the staff about forecasts of unemployment rates, and if using FRB/US about 50 basis points; two-quarters-ahead that reality versus the notion that we are now, through simulations of those forecasts, saying that we are going to accurately predict changes of somewhere around 30 or 40 basis points three and how meaningful

I think you are getting at two different types of uncertainty. that in terms of the actual effect of some policy action, like the policy actions that we are is uncertainty about what its marginal effects would be on the economy. you point estimates, but as we pointed out, there is a huge degree of MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. One is talking about here, there We are just giving uncertainty about what their marginal impact would be on the economy.  But the other memo

December 11-12, 2012

the labor market provides a different take on uncertainty, which goes beyond what the would be:  It is a highly uncertain world; all sorts of unexpected things ability to forecast where the unemployment rate will be in a is distinct from effects of policy. about marginal effect of policy can hit the economy.  Therefore, our year or two, or even a few months, is quite uncertain.  But that uncertainty uncertainty about the forecasts are in the absence of shocks, so this uncertainty here is you believe to be the structure of the marginal effect-this outcome is a model MR. PLOSSER.  These about what outcome, I understand.

It is a model outcome, and there is a lot of uncertainty around MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. its estimate of the marginal effect.  And then, in addition, there is a much wider uncertainty in the world around what will happen to unemployment and other factors.

answer is about MR. PLOSSER.  So these answers are built into the model-I mean, this what the model says as opposed to what some other model might say.

So you could put confidence intervals on that, just on the your uncertainty about the channel-how the policy would affect the economy. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Yes. basis of

I'm assuming-and this is my question-that Is that a correct MR. FISHER.  I haven't read everything likely tax revenue this is sort of a way to justify what may be nonremittances or deferred assets.

I think that part of it was to put it in the framework of the entire are we having low remittances, or why are MS. IHRIG.  Well, economy.  That is, if we have low remittances, why we having a deferred asset?  And we wanted to remind everybody that it might be because the macroeconomy is improving.

IHRIG.  There is, in the overall macroeconomy, a benefit.  I think that was the main that in the memo. MS. point of putting pass-through of Treasury-not so much to the primary mortgages, but to corporate good speech, Governor Stein, in which you said that declines in longerlike when you buy a underlying asset purchases is only partially developed.  So I want to a point, as Simon pointed out-and by the MR. FISHER.  My second question is on the assumption of a one-for-one the decline in the 10-year bond rates, which would have the usual impact on investment spending.  These assumptions are imposed.  You gave a term rates from lower-term premiums may not change the hurdle rate for new investments.  We have other models-I mean, there are a lot of disclaimers here.  Page 7 is prescription drug and you get this long printout:  Don't do this; don't do that.  And it even says that the economic theory explore that one-for-one pass-through.  We are at way, excellent presentation-where we have had this enormous rally, a lot of issuance.

yesterday with Brown-Forman's issue of that one bond-they are the purveyors of I paid attention to it-we did break through the record at you pointed October presentation, I forget in which chart.  The net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is now Interestingly, Jack Daniel's whiskey, which is why $1.025 trillion in investment-grade credits.  We passed through the junk mark that out in your

December 11-12, 2012

wondering how confident you are in the onepass-through, and, very importantly, how dependent on that one-to-one pass-through are you drew?  Granted, you are very careful to state that there is a lot of 1.5, which is above pre-crisis levels.  So I am just to-one the conclusions that uncertainty around the one-to-one pass-through, but how dependent on it is your analysis?

you correctly point out, we are using just one modeling estimating these effects, and under that framework shifts in the risk of publicpass-through to things like is a modeling question that perhaps Dave could elaborate are other models in which these purchases may impact markets.  If there is you are buying and how that works. MS. REMACHE.  I think, as framework for sector holdings have an effect on the term premium embedded in interest rates, and then that feeds through to other interest rates.  Whether or how the one-for-one corporates and such affects the results on.  But there segmentation, it may depend more on which assets

I?  I am not very all.  In terms of the first thing you focused on, the pass-through into corporate rates, I evidence that it may not be one for one, but a pretty high pass-through into corporate bond rates. to what these various changes in long-term interest rates and other asset financial economy-there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty about that. effects have changed over time because the first got into these purchases, are different now. confidence effects, market functioning effects-these effects may be from what they were.  So, without belaboring the point, I'd say there is a lot of MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  So my overall response is:  How uncertain am certain at am less worried about that.  There is a lot of nonetheless the evidence supports However, the evidence on what it does to the exchange rate and the stock market, and going from there conditions do to the real These effects could be smaller.  It could be that the conditions that existed back in 2009, when we So expectational effects, different now

channels and that there could be offsets in other directions.  For example, we are not any positive feedback on house prices.  In reality, the low-mortgage-rate you have put in place is bumping up house prices.  Moreover, maybe that effects on certain households-increasing their willingness of banks to provide credit, and so on.  Anyway, my point is are good arguments for why large.  I think there are also arguments for why FRB/US may be It is extremely difficult to tie these forecasts I should say, though, that one also has to worry that maybe FRB/US doesn't capture all of the relevant taking account of environment that bumping up of house prices is having favorable access to credit or the simply that there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty.  There FRB/US's effects may be too neglecting some things that could be important. down.

a few certainties come out of these forecasts:  The first is the high I just stated seem like highly likely outcomes under either strategy.  Is that MR. FISHER.  But likelihood of a deferred asset.  Second, a possible likelihood of balance sheet impairmentpossible, low probability.  Third, a possible need for us to change our exit strategy.  At least the first and the third correct?

there are a lot of assumptions that go see just by comparing the memo-which used the the December Tealbook-which actually has lower the fed funds rate lifts is a little lower.  The deferred asset for the $500 billion program is MS. IHRIG.  I think in terms of the deferred asset, into the balance sheet and income projections.  One of the inputs is the financial market conditions, or the interest rate paths.  You can October Tealbook rates-with those using rates because the staff projection is that the economy is a little weaker and off a little later, and the path

December 11-12, 2012

trillion of purchases next year, the deferred $45 billion down to $4 billion.  I don't know if you want to say those are large changes in interest rate assumptions, but with such changes we can have relatively in the projections.  I don't know how you want to about our projections.  However, they do going forward. not there in the December Tealbook, and in the $1 asset went from or modest large changes in the size of the deferred asset think of that in terms of how certain or uncertain we are rely on the financial market conditions we are expecting remittances to the Treasury.  Of course, the exit changed.  We looked at a 'No Sale' scenario as sort of an illustrative example variations that I think could be explored.  But it was quite notable in the MS. REMACHE.  I would just add that the third point about exit strategy does factor importantly into the pattern of income and strategy could be of that.  There are other memo that using those higher interest rates had such a substantial effect on the pattern of income and the deferred asset that was recorded.

thoughtful, however scary, memo. much for your good work. MR. FISHER.  Well, I want to thank you for a very Thank you very

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Rosengren.

your results to your assumption where you where you hold all of the longest-duration Treasuries, where you hold an entirely mortgage-backed securities portfolio.  Those are the three MR. ROSENGREN.  My question is, how sensitive are of what a normalized balance sheet looks like?  Think of three different options:  one return to a T-bill-only balance sheet, one and one extremes.  Would there be much difference in what these patterns would look like, or would that not make a big difference?

IHRIG.  In terms of the contour, I don't think it makes much difference.  What the assumption we have in terms of MBS rolling off, MS. contour is really reflecting is the exit strategy

December 11-12, 2012

you are only holding MBS, then it would just be the Treasuries rolling off.  You would have you would first have it declining from whatever peak we have. or if slightly different contour, but size of the balance sheet is the normal size, The currency in circulation is your biggest In terms of income, it would matter. And then, the normalization to the point where the again, that is going to reflect the liabilities we have. liability.  So in terms of the contour, not necessarily.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.

Presumably you've got a starting date for what would be a normal-sized your underlying assumption about how fast that you get to 2021 that gives you this trend line? MR. PLOSSER. SOMA portfolio-what is the date, and what is is going to grow until

IHRIG.  The date actually isn't a fixed date.  We look at the fact that as, say, you do Treasuries roll off the portfolio, that is going to drain reserves, and we have to reserves. MS. sales of MBS or hit some normal level of you come up with the normal. MR. PLOSSER.  I'm trying to figure out where

Yes.  In the analysis we do, we assume pre-crisis reserve balances of is when we decide normalization is, but at the same time, you have to look at $25 billion and whatever currency happens to be at that point. MS. IHRIG. $25 billion.  That what the currency is in the portfolio at that point in time.  So normalization is when reserve balances hit

December 11-12, 2012

you are making some assumption about the growth rate of asking.  What are you assuming the growth rate of currency MR. PLOSSER.  But currency, and that's the question I'm is?

Yes.  The growth rate of currency is whatever the growth rate of nominal you look at the annual growth rate of currency over, say, the last 20 years, the last 10 have for the long-term MS. IHRIG. GDP is.  If years, the last 5 years, it is around 6 percent.  So implicitly that is what we trend.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.

you, Mr. Chairman.  I'd like to thank the staff for this detailed was very good.  I have two comments on the the the associated automatic stabilizer effects.  The second comment is that I think the Congress would allowing the payment of interest on reserves. MR. BULLARD.  Thank memo on balance sheet options, which I thought memo.  One comment is that I would like to see more emphasis on the adjustability of balance sheet policy and I thought that some scenarios seem politically untenable to me, as reconsider

Committee.  However, I think it also tends to deemphasize one of the relative strength or weakness in incoming data.  This is Let me just talk about balance sheet adjustability first.  The memo emphasizes the total expected amount of the increase in the size of the balance sheet when discussing the impact of the balance sheet policy in the near term.  I see this approach as a practical way of laying down some alternatives for the great strengths of the September 2012 decision, namely, that the program can and should be adjusted as the data on the economy arrive.  Committee adjustments would send an important signal to the private sector concerning how the Committee thinks the economy is performing relative to expectations.  Private sector expectations about the total size and duration of the program will also adjust according to the

December 11-12, 2012

exactly what the total size and duration of the program will guess that will likely turn out to be inaccurate as events unfold during the coming quarters. can lay down a baseline path in the expectation that the path will likely be adjusted One implication of this approach to policy is that there is less need to commit is actually going to about the way the analysis had to be done, that I think it would be too difficult to capture that.  But I think it's an the automatic stabilizer feature of the current policy.  The great advantage of this approach is that we do not have to lay down today be-a Instead, we as the data arrive. to an extensive program today, before we know how the 2013 U.S. economy perform.  So I thought that, maybe by necessity part just couldn't be captured; important consideration for the Committee.

interest on reserves in 2008.  The Congress asset for purposes of remittances to the Treasury and may result in the Congress reverting to the banks.  Losing the consequences for the I caution the Committee that we probably do not want to be in the the staff also recognizes political difficulties, but that is up to I think it is a My second point is about the political feasibility of some of the balance sheet scenarios. The Federal Reserve was granted authority to pay had previously opposed use of this tool for monetary policy for many decades.  Some scenarios in the memo have the Fed claiming a deferred but simultaneously making rather large interest payments to mostly very large banks.  My view is that such a scenario is politically treacherous previous policy of not allowing the payment of interest on reserves to large ability to pay interest on reserves would, of course, have devastating Committee's exit strategy.  So situation where the perception is that payments to the Treasury are on hold but payments to banks are substantial.  I think that the judgment of the Committee here.  So I just wanted to point that one out because glaring one in this particular analysis.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Any other questions?

December 11-12, 2012

a adjusted.  I think the question we discussed there, but I don't think really for a benefit in terms of business and consumer confidence that the we were MR. ENGLISH.  One thought for President Bullard.  On your first point, we did have memo back in August that tried to talk about some of these benefits of open-ended, flexible programs that could be resolved, is the potential Federal Reserve will adjust if there are shocks and keep the economy on track.  But never, I think, able to figure out how big that effect would be.  But it seemed like a potential benefit.

I just didn't want to it in the discussion here. MR. BULLARD.  Yes.  And I appreciate that previous analysis; forget

President Kocherlakota. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Question?

a question.  [Laughter]  I will be brief, Mr. you said yourself, that.  This memo really brought home to me more than the previous got from the staff that I think there is a relatively high probability that we may have a we choose to be our exit strategy.  And I would urge us to possibility with a number of constituencies: and, ultimately, the public.  I don't think we should just wait communication.  I think we should I think it integrates with restructuring our exit given the size of the balance sheet that we MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I can phrase it as Chairman.  My brief comment is that when I read this memo-this memo, as is just excellent-I thought the discussion of the negative or zero remittance issue was quite complete, and I appreciated memos we period of zero remittances, whatever think about communicating proactively about this the Congress; our external auditors; until the time when we have zero remittances to begin that start planning for that communication now. strategy principles, which probably will not be tenable are likely to embark on.  I'm not sure the best way to structure that conversation.  One idea that struck me as potentially fruitful is to have the hardest working people in central banking, our

December 11-12, 2012

we choose to proceed, I communications subcommittee, formulate a plan of attack.  But however do think we should be communicating proactively about this possibility.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President

I always thought that the economic argument for the gain due to the fall in the MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a comment and related question, and the comment was inspired by the line of questioning from Governor Raskin and the staff's response.  First, a compliment:  This Set aside two things:  one, that we would run out down our liabilities; and, two, the political risks of no remittances and a big deferred asset, which are highly consequential. irrelevance of unrealized capital losses and the zero remittances was the fact that on the Treasury's balance sheet there is an equal and opposite sort of capital real market value of their liabilities.

analysis sort of shines a spotlight on a can of worms talked about.  This whole analysis is based on the implications of that it doesn't disappear:  It flows through our income you can sort of consolidate the Fed's and the Treasury's balance sheets, and in others it at the balance sheet naturally draws you to government's intertemporal budget constraint, and through that lens, there are you truncate your horizon years ahead, you have this sort of free variable-debt at the end assuming that in all your analysis of taking duration out, you haven't gone through the implications of the government's intertemporal budget constraint; you Now, viewed through this lens, this here that we haven't really taking duration risk, and it points out statement eventually.  So the traditional approach to these kinds of things-you know, in some settings makes sense to keep them separate.  But looking looking at the going to be ramifications down the road for tax or spending policy.  If and just look a certain number of of the horizon.  And I'm really

December 11-12, 2012

the period be the free variable.  And that is consistent with figure 2 in consequential or not, but it suggests that it useful to at least check to see that there aren't any implications-especially at a time as getting close to the limits of a debt-to-GDP ratio that we find you have thought about that or not. just let debt at the end of exhibit 2 up here.  I don't know if it is empirically would be where many perceive us sustainable.  I don't know if

Well, agents understand that in the long run, none of these policies will years, and then tax rates in the baseline case.

A lot of this a residual of economy is underutilized at the moment.  Additional asset purchases closer to potential output.  That's a revenue

market private employment growth will average about 150,000 jobs year.  This pace is a little higher than in October projection and is basically in line with the recent signal from the I've highlighted in the past for recession-related distortions to seasonal factors.  On the decline since the middle of the year I would only venture to note that the lower not imply a commensurate narrowing in the margin of unemployment gap closer great deal of thought between now and Last Friday's employment report largely left intact our view that the labor has been improving about in line with our expectations or perhaps a little faster.  On the establishment side, it now appears that the hurricane left a smaller imprint on job growth in November than we had anticipated, which points to a correspondingly smaller bounceback in published payroll employment over the next couple of months. However, we saw nothing in the report that would lead us to revise our Tealbook forecast that underlying per month through the first quarter of next our statistical model-shown in the bottom-left panel-that and that pools estimates of private employment from the household and establishment surveys, controlling household side, the unemployment rate was reported to have declined two-tenths in November to 7.7 percent, bringing the cumulative to ยฝ percentage point.  Our thinking about how to respond to this surprise is still at a very preliminary stage, so at this point unemployment rate may unused labor resources; it could be, for example, that the natural rate has begun to decline earlier than we had expected, leaving the resulting to our forecast.  We will be giving this issue a the January meeting.

In particular, real coming into the fourth quarter than we had assumed.  Our more-pessimistic Tealbook was closed.  Moreover, goods was we had anticipated, we expect the pace of capital expenditures near term as concerns about the macroeconomy and the little less momentum in aggregate demand.  Although third-quarter came in higher than our federal defense purchases and inventory investment-two categories of demand with, if anything, negative signal content for future demand.  In fact, growth in private domestic final purchases-generally a better demand-came in lower consumer spending surprised us to the downside and now appears to be on a weaker trajectory view of near-term consumer spending is reinforced by the weaker-than-expected incoming news on real disposable personal income as well as by December's drop in consumer sentiment, which we received after the while the most recent reading on orders and shipments of capital somewhat better than to remain subdued in the policy environment damp firms' enthusiasm for undertaking additional investment.

Absent these two effects, at an annual rate of just ยฝ percent. The near-term picture for spending effects of last summer's production in the Northeast that resulted from Hurricane Sandy.

The rise in export growth is driven by two central forecast.  First, the broad real value of the dollar declines at nearly a 3 percent annual pace, reflecting trend depreciation against emerging market currencies as well as an easing of financial stresses in Europe that reverses safe-haven flows.  Although the dollar's path is a bit higher in this pressure as markets reduce their expectations for still provides important support to our sales abroad.  Second, foreign growth recovers to nearly 3 Europe ends and U.S. growth accelerates.  This trajectory is little changed October Tealbook.  Since then, however, we've received two pieces of and one piece of bad news, and these have had offsetting effects on our outlook.

When we look at individual instruments, certainly we look generally speaking, we interested in developments within the financial system and within systemically important institutions, but we also look at overall movements in credit in the nonfinancial sector, like in the first exhibit, because, in the past, that has been one of the indicators of systemic risk.

Now our indicators are I think, in general, it is really hard.  We really would love to be able to identify And then we also look for other things that see them right now:  embedded leverage maturity transformation going on to finance things that if sentiment were to shift quickly, that financing would disappear and people would have to unwind positions.  That was missing from my exhibits because while we have seen places, we haven't seen imperfect, but we haven't seen it in those indicators or in our conversations with market participants. when risk-taking was excessive.  I think we try to be prudent and just look for when there is risktaking and not think we know too well when it is excessive.

Given that people as they did in the past, I think we should be low interest rate a sharp rise in interest rates on the list of the risk scenarios that were stability in the future? point out, Michael, that may be the FOMC's intention, they are starting to express a number of concerns.  Senior officials has moved from money more vulnerable to rate increases when they this current low interest rate environment is unfamiliar and is starting to upset some of the longstanding behavioral are staying out of the stock market because all they've mainly seen is losses over this period of time, while retirees may be changing their behaviors and not reacting aware of the unintended and perhaps unexpected consequences of this environment.  I don't see handed out in the package on financial markets and institutions, and maybe we should consider putting it on that list.  The memo that was circulated mentions that such developments bear watching.  So my question is, how are we thinking about monitoring and assessing that risk as we think about financial exercise or the exercise you referred to with regard to and a few things about some people are concerned and some people aren't as concerned yet.  As you know, there years that banks should be focused on interest rate supervisors going out to smaller banks, not just those involved in the exercises, it is on their radar screen.  In thinking about other investors, certainly we've MR. KILEY.  We think it's very important to monitor that risk, and we have done so in a variety of ways related to the CCAR banks.

That's performed; we don't necessarily see going on, and it's something we want to be more attuned I don't think we've seen any large changes in the positions at large insurers, for example, years.  There seem to be some gradual shifts, but nothing dramatic. insurers-and there have been signs of in their willingness to take on credit risk at insurers, for example.  They and they actually do go through quite testing.  They're the all of those results, but we know that's to.  But over the last several from more ETFs.  And there are staff members who are were to reverse, it would place strains in I think there is potential for concern there.  That risk.  One might imagine, for example, that some retail interconnected dealers are not as clear on the degree to which that is a financial risk, but it is something we want to think about. One thing that some people have talked about is this shift into bond funds retail money, perhaps facilitated to some degree by wondering about the degree to which, if that money corporate bond and loan markets-that those markets just are less liquid, and not especially liquid today.  So if there were a large reversal, concern could involve individuals losing a lot of money.  There is a question about the degree to which that is a financial stability investors, to the extent they're driving bond funds, may move out quickly for a retail investor, but they will, perhaps unfortunately for them, have moved out after highly or others may have moved out.  So we stability

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.

from financial stability back to the forecast, David, you talked either interact or differ or are removed; that represents a big from the staff's forecast.  I actually happen to believe that general I have two questions.  One is, what does FRB/US tell you without that In other words, how important is that in the nature of don't know how much light you MR. PLOSSER.  To shift a lot about uncertainty and pessimism and how those two perhaps the same, and the slow process by which that is likely to be headwind on the economy proposition, but adjustment about the path of the economy? your forecast?  That would be one question I would have, and I can shed on that.

I was describing is a sort of judgmental overlay.  It's I think that we've assumed that related to the fiscal cliff, the alone will take something on the order of about ยผ percentage point off first half of this coming year, and then that will lift as a restraining factor. I thought was really nice yesterday that showed analysts' mean expectations of analysts.  Now, the dispersion is a rough and imperfect proxy as a proxy for true uncertainty.  Those two things are very highly goes up, and that reverses pretty reliably on the other side. between those two variables. MR. WILCOX.  I don't think FRB/US speaks to uncertainty per se-I'm looking to Dave Reifschneider.  What we've done and what a modest effect.  For example, uncertainty component GDP growth over the Boy, at this point, our ability to discern those kinds of effects is pretty limited.  John Stevens had another panel that earnings and the dispersion among for analysts' true uncertainty, but there's a fair amount of literature suggesting that there is probably something to it negatively correlated.  So when pessimism increases-in other words, when the mean expectation comes down-uncertainty That suggests that there's quite a lot of colinearity

December 11-12, 2012

appreciate that, but I was also noting that, particularly in the representing the policy uncertainty index is actually highly to me.  So the way you described it and the Tealbook described it, you've got gradually but continuing to weigh on things seems to be highly that it could drop very sharply under some circumstances, right? MR. PLOSSER.  Yes.  I bottom-right panel, the blue line volatile, it seems this pessimism and uncertainty sort of waning very for what appears to be a fair amount of time into the future.  Yet this index volatile, and it could turn out given you enough history here on the panel for able to discern.  The main thing that's happened to that blue line is that it's just higher from these two different gauges, and we're trying to wrestle with MR. WILCOX.  It could.  Now, I haven't you to be post-2007 than it was before.  One of the key points that I was trying to illustrate is that we're getting conflicting readings this.  Our measurement tools are pretty imperfect, and the analytical apparatus itself is a little creaky, too.

MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.

a couple of quick questions they build, I think, nicely on President I think she pointed out that we are having a very unusual experience, from at how long interest rates have been that have had these low environments for extended periods:  Japan in the past 15 years or so; the United wondering to what extent we can look at those historical experiences as MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have and comments on the financial stability report, and Pianalto's remarks. least the postwar experience in the United States, in terms of low and are expected to remain low.  But there are other countries interest rate States in the 1930s.  I'm guides to what we should be looking for in our current environment to try to build up notions of

may not be the same as what we financial excesses in these low interest rate environments.  They experienced in 2006 and 2007; it may take different forms.

interest rates sliding down further.  Because are so low, people don't think about this risk as much, which is, I think, a reason to you think about inflation expectations sliding down from where they are So I was wondering what would on financial stability if we had a 50 to 100 basis point fall in longer-term Treasury 2013. Second, President Pianalto mentioned her concern about interest rates spiking upward, which I think is very much a risk we should be keeping in our minds.  But I'm actually also concerned about the possibility of longer-term interest rates think about it more.  If right now or, maybe even more possible, a further flight to quality driven by European events, both of those would drive down longer-term yields still further. be the effect yields over the course of certainly should acknowledge that interest go lower or higher.  In the CCAR exercise, the stress test we're putting the from that process on the developments on concern will be.  In certainly have looked at Japan, and I System have.  The Japanese had low interest rates for a long There haven't been crises in Japan where you've seen a strains on some institutions.  In the late 1990s, failed.  They failed for reasons that perhaps reflect what caused them to get MR. KILEY.  On that second point, I think we rates can definitely banks through, long-term interest rates fall about 50 basis points further, and the economy is quite weak.  So at least we'll have some information the banking side, in terms of the credit losses from the very weak economy.  In thinking about low interest rates due to a very weak economy, that's where much of the terms of thinking about the international experience, we know many people throughout the time.  One hasn't seen them get out of that experience, and one hasn't particularly seen too many issues related to financial stability. further leg down.  Now, they have had significant seven large insurers

They government-run insurer that was government guarantee essentially made them uncompetitive, into a low interest rate actually had much riskier portfolios than insurers in the United States, and the combination of a decline in stock prices with the fact that they competed with a able to underprice them and had a so they went out of business.

that I, of course, don't want to bet on but the risk to financial stability will arise economy looks like it's getting better, perhaps quickly, and people start changing their want to be attuned to the persistently low interest underappreciate, and that.  Going forward-I guess my bias, and I hope it doesn't drive us when people start being really optimistic, not during I think we want to look further there.  One thing that we talk about is that a lot of people are concerned that when the behavior.  And that will be the situation where the Committee will be thinking hard about whether interest rates need to go up.  I think we rate environment creating incentives for people to do new things that they we're on the lookout for too much-we really need to be concerned this current period.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.

wanted to make one quick point to add to Steve Kamin's mind-it's a he had a full willingness to I'm not an employee of the federal government, and he that I would not pass it on except to this Committee.  [Laughter]  He does not share his of the U.S. government.  First of all-and we reported some of this point politically, in MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I observations.  Having just come back from Germany and taken advantage of the trip that Dennis Lockhart, Christine Cumming, and I took to get some insight into Schรคuble's relationship that goes back a very long time.  And by the way, discuss with me his feelings because knew feelings with employees information back to Steve Kamin-Germany is nowhere near its breaking

December 11-12, 2012

'the guilt is in our bones; we know that.'  The opposition to What's very interesting about seeing him that he was the interior minister.  He has intelligence on every single one of them, and effective in terms of getting folks to work.  So point number one is they are a choking point on their willingness to continue, and point number two, for what terms of support for Europe-I think that's important-and for paying to make the European project work because he said bailouts is stronger than the CDU-CSU coalition. work is he's extremely nowhere near it's worth, is he's certain that another Greek restructuring is more or less inevitable.

I thought Michael's excellent.  You know, one of the rules of thumb has been that when sovereign things, it's a bottom-that is, you want to get out.  And just going I notice that for Disney's issue-it did a 3-year, 10-year, and Norwegians and something you may begin to just watch.  I don't and now to 370 for the 30-year issue.  I don't that is, but 30 percent seemed a fairly high I know follow-by the time they pile in, it's time to sell them and I and so thanks to you, Nellie, sitting in the back row, your presentation. Just two other quick points.  With regard to financial stability, presentation was wealth funds start to buy through some of the recent issues, 30-year recently-30 percent of the takedown was sovereign wealth funds: others.  I don't know if that's atypical, but that's know if that's out of proportion or not, but the rates were extraordinary.  It was, along with Texas Instruments, 45 basis points for the 3-year know if we have a measurement as to how normal number to me.  I would just suggest that-and maybe it's not, but it is a general rule that at least most shrewd investors that something.  Just an observation.  But I do want to thank you for this work.  This issue of financial stability is something that President Rosengren and President Kocherlakota other presidents have been deeply interested in; and thanks to you, Michael, for

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.

December 11-12, 2012

you, Mr. Chairman.  I just have one question on exhibit 1, 'Private Nonfinancial Sector Credit-to-GDP Ratio.'  I'm just wondering what all, is the trend here the trend given by the HP data, or is it HP filtered through something else?  I think it is through these it to mean that, according to this metric, deleveraging is overdone to ramp up again, or is that not where picture? MR. BULLARD.  Thank figure 1, which is your interpretation of this figure is.  First of filtered through these data.  And should I interpret already or something like that, where you'd expect credit you want to go with this

MR. KILEY.  Yes.  That would be the strong interpretation, which I don't think we'd want to take.

MR. BULLARD.  Okay.

there has been a fair amount of research MR. KILEY.  We look at this measure because really emphasizing that credit booms- data. MR. BULLARD.  So it's HP filtered through these

HP filtered through all of these data.  We understand It could be that we still have quite a way to go, and the fact that it is below the trend My colleague, Rochelle Edge, has done research investigating some of BIS and elsewhere on the usefulness of these measures in real time, and are valuable to look at.  So go further than saying it appears that firms and households in total are still advanced, but we're unsure.  So I'd put big confidence that we've overshot MR. KILEY.  That's right, and it's that when you do that, you have a real problem with the endpoint:  Where does the delevering cycle end? line could be misleading. the work by folks at the she's found that they're not hugely useful in real time but nonetheless I think we wouldn't delevering-that that process may be intervals around that red dotted line, and I wouldn't take seriously the idea yet.

December 11-12, 2012

Maybe I could just suggest an alternative metric to compare this one with nominal GDP from 1990 till today.  I think credit ramped up dramatically over come down some but would still be way above the nominal GDP trend. you the idea that, yes, there's been deleveraging, but it has still got a long MR. BULLARD. with:  just take a nominal GDP-these are nominal figures, right?-trend and look where it is compared the decades and has Maybe that would give way to go.

I think essentially that's really close to what's here, if not almost MR. KILEY.  Yes, exactly.

MR. BULLARD.  Oh, is it?

I think it's literally a ratio of private nonfinancial sector credit to total If you don't view there being a secular trend, I you really think there's some sort of stable ratio that we could see if we went MR. KILEY. nominal GDP, not private nonfinancial GDP. think it indicates that we had a long credit boom, and that long credit boom has not been unwound, if significantly further back.

I'm sorry.  I'm stating it wrong.  It should be flat, according to my MR. BULLARD. notion, and it's not.

MR. KILEY.  That's right.

MR. BULLARD.  Got

the Vice Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  A two-handed intervention from ratio is determining are two big drivers:  one, the amount of financial intermediation would tell you get to a higher level of VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  The problem with assessing this where you should be.  And there that's going on in the economy, which presumably is increasing over time, and which you that there should probably be a secular uptrend, at least as

December 11-12, 2012

and, two, the tax code.  To the extent that you have mortgage interest plans, they're also going to influence where you end up.  I think it's where we are today relative to where we're supposed to be. economic development; deductibility and 401(k) very hard to know

Tarullo. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor

MR. TARULLO.  Michael, can you disaggregate the private nonfinancial sector creditto-GDP ratio between households and nonfinancial business?

MR. KILEY.  We do, and that is in the QS report; I probably won't be able to find the page.  It's close to but after page 169.

I stopped reading. MR. TARULLO.  Just before

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Even the page numbers have standard errors.

can talk at the break if you want. MR. TARULLO.  That's okay.  We taken up their leverage ratio on a sweet spot in terms of credit quality. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Corporate America has purpose because they view that there is

I was wondering because my impression was that ran from 1975 to 2000, we are right about where that trend line would have taken you, but it was in 2001 that that line shot MR. TARULLO.  That's exactly what if you extended the trend line for household leverage that now right up.

Jeremy has the answer.  What's the average for the corporate credit today compared with 30 years ago?  It's got to be a little lower. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Maybe rating

That's why I was asking the question. MR. TARULLO.

at a table of contents too quickly.  It's QS report.  So it's actually before page 169. MR. KILEY.  So there was the danger of looking on page 153 of the

MR. TARULLO.  Didn't get to that either.

December 11-12, 2012

a much stronger trend in the household sector over the you talked about than you do for businesses. MR. KILEY.  You certainly see entire period and over the sample

MR. TARULLO.  Thanks.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Raskin.

you're looking at a metric that is based on the long-run is the long-run relationship between house MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Michael Kiley, on the house price overvaluation, you tell us that relationship between house prices and rent.  What prices and rent?  How do you do that; how have we constructed the long term?

I'll defer to Josh because he's really the expert on this subject. it works is we take a regression of the rentestimate of the current interest rate to remove are various ways of doing it, but that's the basic idea.  Sometimes we include analysis.  And, an owners' well, but they basically move roughly in line with each other over long periods rent is because that series has a longer history, and we estimate the model over a longer period of time. MR. KILEY.  Maybe MR. GALLIN.  Okay.  Basically the way price ratio on a time trend and on things like an their effects; there a change in the interest rate as well-just sort of a kitchen-sink version of this over time, what we're using is rents from the CPI, rents for tenants; there is equivalent rent as of time.  The reason we use the tenants' can actually go? MS. RASKIN.  So do you know offhand what that period of time is?  How far back in time do those series

Late 1970s-1975, 1977, something like that. MR. GALLIN.

MR. WILCOX.  The first quarter of 1975.

you were actually to have the long-run version, what you would see in of exhibit 1 would be that there was an increase both in the relationship MR. GALLIN.  If the middle-right panel

December 11-12, 2012

high in the late got back down to trend was largely by sort of getting eroded by inflationThen you can see the other house price Now, cities like L.A. and Boston in the late 1980s and mid-1980s that saw big price The big difference in this episode, as you can see on the chart, is that house prices got with rents than they had in the historical period, and obviously this time and the deviation from trend in the late 1970s.  House prices were relatively 1970s.  The way they of course, in that time period, inflation was a lot higher. boom was in the late 1980s, and again, in that case, house prices came back into line at the national level, but more through just a long period of not rising while rents increased. there were some declines. much further out of line the correction did not occur through stagnation in house prices and rise in rents:  It occurred, as you know, through plummeting house prices.

MS. RASKIN.  Thank you.

In a minute, we can take a break for lunch, but when for participants to comment on financial stability If anyone has any further thoughts on financial stability, that would be the opportunity to go to the economic go-round.  Forty minutes for lunch, say?  Come 1:55 p.m.?  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay. we come back, there will be the opportunity issues. do that.  And then we will back at alternatives B and C is changed take account of the new employment data. MS. DANKER.  I just also wanted to mention that we'll be distributing during lunch a revised version of the statements, where the first paragraph of just a little bit to

[Lunch recess]

I have President CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay, why don't we recommence?  At this point we have an opportunity for participants to comment on financial stability issues, and Rosengren and Vice Chairman Dudley on my list.  President Rosengren.

December 11-12, 2012

in the financial stability go-round, so when there is good news, I think it is worth my perspective, the actions that the FSOC took related to money effect than I might have expected.  Officials at floating-rate NAVs.  Some of the SEC floating-rate NAVs.  I think that's a really big move from where we were just last announced that she's leaving the MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I very rarely have an opportunity to say good things talking about.  And from market funds actually have had a more positive some of the money market funds are now discussing commissioners are, at least publicly, saying that they now may support additional action, including September, and that's despite the fact that Mary Schapiro has SEC.

NAVs would be a significant improvement over the current situation, where and taking credit risk.  A will make clear that prices can fluctuate and that investors need to consider the before investing in a money market fund.  I would note that even with a assets of prime money generally not changed since the most recent uncertainty raises the issue of whether pricing of these products will be that might address the I would say that the developments, while we're far from Floating-rate money market funds promise fixed NAVs while holding no capital floating NAV potential for fluctuations floating NAV, there are still run risks at money market funds.  Many market funds do not trade or trade very infrequently and include credit risk.  In addition, amortized cost accounting can obscure the value of assets.  Given that positions are known until the end of each month, there's still the potential for window dressing, which may raise suspicion among investors in a crisis that positions may have public disclosure.  This sufficiently sticky, that investors will run from funds with credit risk not fully reflected in the pricing, potentially causing fire sale prices and leaving the remaining investors with large losses. As a result, we should be open to options in addition to the floating NAV risk of runs at money market funds.  But

Second, I think Germany has made a very conscious decision that it EU, at least through the October 2013 German elections. no one else is going very much reduced at the current time.  And that's important because it buys time for That's a doesn't want to kick Greece out of the I think that's important because if Greece isn't going to get kicked out, then to get kicked out in the interim because everybody else looks quite a bit better than Greece.  So the risk of a contagion event in Europe, or an expectation that other countries might be forced to exit, is fiscal consolidation, structural reform, and pan-European institution building to actually proceed.

I don't think that Europe is likely to be a is that it's not bought themselves is actually going to be spent going to soon generate a more favorable set of debt-to-GDP trajectories.

Further monetary accommodation is required to offset the stiff headwinds holding back aggregate demand.  Households continue to trim debt.  Many potential borrowers still face tight credit.  Public sector budgets are under pressure, and global economic growth remains sluggish.  It seems that every time a signal is about to turn green, the caution light flashes again.  In this regard, the sharp drop in December consumer reminder of how quickly over the outlook for fiscal policy and the are particularly worried and uncertain.  This anxiety is undermining the longer-term commitments, such as investing in capital expenditures and found that when uncertainty rises, capital and full-time employment fall, but part-time employment rises.  That is, under grown considerably this year, accounting for employment provides additional evidence that meetings, this research also shows that uncertainty affects the economy while also putting Businesspeople willingness to engage in in hiring full-time employees.  My staff has studied how uncertainty affects business decisions about both investment and employment.  They spending heightened uncertainty, employers hedge their bets, adjusting hours rather than jobs to meet output demand.  These effects are sizable and consistent with the downshift in business investment and the increase in part-time employment that we've observed in recent months. Indeed, involuntary part-time employment has about 40 percent of civilian job growth since March.  The observed pattern of reduced investment and greater use of part-time heightened uncertainty is playing a significant role in holding back the pace of recovery.  And as I mentioned at previous like an adverse demand shock, reducing desired investment in employment

December 11-12, 2012

that monetary policy downward pressure on inflation.  And these are exactly the kinds of shocks can and should seek to offset.

question is whether the tools that we have left-I think mainly rates and stimulating capital investment, especially, I've said, because many businesses appear nearly paralyzed by uncertainty.  But capital more.  The exchange of monetary policy on real I'm getting a lot of research from them at this time [laughter]-recently the exchange value of the dollar to LSAP announcements.  Using of monetary policy is still and kicking. Of course, the important further asset purchases-will still be effective and, in particular, whether further reductions in longer-term interest rates will boost aggregate demand.  Certainly, there may be limited returns to pushing down long-term corporate bond as expenditures represent only one of the channels through which interest rates affect the economy. Purchases of Treasuries and MBS have also helped lower auto loan rates and mortgage rates, thereby supporting consumer spending and the housing sector.  But there's rate is another important channel by which LSAPs affect the economy.  For example, according to the FRB/US model simulations, roughly one-third of the effect output occurs through the exchange rate channel.  My staff-clearly we're at the end of the evaluation period, so examined the response of intradaily data, they found that the dollar typically depreciated in response to surprise expansionary monetary policy announcements since the end of 2008.  Furthermore, the effects of the announcement surprises on the dollar over this period were similar in magnitude to the effects of similarly scaled surprise movements in the federal funds rate over the period from 1994 to 2008.  This analysis suggests that the exchange rate channel very much alive

While it is unfortunate these policies are not working in tandem, it is not a reason for us to stay on the sidelines.

I think this positive sentiment is worth noting, but I don't see expand business operations and grow payrolls.  With some exceptions, businesses remain very cautious in their spending.  The unusual circumstances at this juncture seem to have elicited a bimodal approach to business planning.

None of very remarkable process as to how quickly direction of the board, until you don't mind, Mr. Chairman, I am going to use a little barnyard analogy here, what I am hearing-for what it's worth, the anecdotal evidence that is who employ people and try to put people to work.

There is American workers, to pump up consumption, at least understand what going to go to work creating jobs.  So I would say Big to we put a fence between in the case of this bull, there is no problem with liquidity.  He is ready to roll; he is ready to do his job.  But what makes the cows.  But we have a fence between the bull and the cows.  Then, he can't do what we pay him for.  In essence plenty of liquidity; they have plenty of wherewithal.  They are strong and well equipped to do what we want them to do, which is create jobs for and to pump up final demand.  But until that fence is removed, or they the fence line is, then businesses are just not that summarizes it, Mr. Chairman, and that's no bull.  Thank you.

And a manufacturer headquartered in North Carolina he was holding off making any new major investments until uncertainty diminished significantly. Of course, the damping effect of uncertainty is not a new idea around this table.  It is mentioned prominently in the Tealbook, in fact, beginning with a reference on page 1.  And the Tealbook is correct, I believe, to cite policy, such as the European growth situation.  Certainly, the presumed resolution of the fiscal cliff and debt consumer spending and thus help boost GDP growth in 2013.  Significant remain, however, even when we get past the cliff are still in train or in litigation, and the economic growth outlook.  I have, accordingly, lowered my forecast for real year and 2.8 percent year after-clearly below the Tealbook forecast and, I think, at the bottom end of the of those years.  I have not raised my unemployment forecast, though.  Recall that percent in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Even if it ticks up percent for the fourth quarter.  That would mean percentage points over three years, while real These data have led me to believe that we may not be that far from a balanced Since our September meeting, I have come to put more weight on these factors damping the medium-term GDP growth in the latest submission, now projecting just 2 percent for next for the range for both the unemployment rate reached 9.9 slightly in December, it would still average 7.8 that the unemployment rate will have fallen 2.1 GDP growth has averaged just 2 percent.

I also met with District, at some insurers, and at a large environment.  In addition concerns that I raised earlier, these conversations helped me to underpin my outlook.

And as we heard although their analysis continues to show that additional purchases also acknowledge that predicting the I have heard, I As plans, but they also are Our models point to the benefits of low interest rates on firms' balance sheets and investments, but my contacts are rates, like rising contributions to defined benefit pension plans, which then limit further investments in their businesses.

Second-half GDP continue to take their toll on the economy, as we've already have continued hiring at plus, but they are doing so without meaningful capacity and the forward indicators and anecdotal reports from my business contacts change in this anytime soon. income growth seems weaker, and the headwinds from household deleveraging continue to be strong.

I'll start locally.  By and large, our months, outside of the relatively small oil boom area in western North eastern Montana.  These anecdotal reports gibe with the hard data.  The Bureau of Statistics reports that the employment cost index in Minneapolis-St. Paul rose 1ยฝ percent In terms of the medium-term outlook for inflation, Ninth District contacts report they have not seen large increases in labor costs and other input prices over the past few Dakota and Labor

Now, if has been between 1.4 and 2.2 percent in each of costs are putting relatively little upward pressure on In fact, unit labor costs are now lower than they were four years ago.

Under what I would see as being appropriate policy, my above 2 percent in 2015, and that's what you I think there are three submissions that have inflation above 2013.

You'll previous meetings estimating have not put coefficient on the gap in to acknowledge that there unemployment and inflation, and I think we should be skeptical about relying on resource slack to keep inflation subdued going forward.

It's I am the 12th person to speak, and no one has made any forecasts about how that VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My view is that you can divorce everything else from the near-term uncertainty about how and interesting, fiscal cliff uncertainty will actually be resolved.

I am very much where President Williams is:  If we actually do fall off the resolved, things would be considerably worse cited.  Number one, I think a big effect on confidence.

good way, not only would you get the benefit of you would also get a recovery of the deferred activity. And if the fiscal cliff were resolved in a confidence, but reasons I think that we should become a little bit and the fact that the drought will presumably be replaced by a more normal will get a rebound in agricultural output-at least the BEA will assume a rebound go into 2013.  Moreover, I think there are other factors that reflect underlying Let me just go through some things that I think are on the positive side of the ledger. there is some uncertainty about where we are in the deleveraging in the margins in the corporate sector are extremely wide, the sector is awash years ago, gradually improving.  I think there is less uncertainty about policy and not like you at least know Obamacare is coming, and you can start to plan for that. also think the innovations in terms of energy costs in the United States are pretty significant, in how they have dramatically competitive position of the United States in manufacturing.  I think we are LNG export.  And the housing sector is clearly on the upswing.  On the economic growth could also be more important than just In addition, there are a number of other more positive about the economic outlook, ex the fiscal cliff-which is a big qualification.  As some people have mentioned, there are the one-time factors:  the rebound in activity following Superstorm Sandy year, and we as we improvement in the economic fundamentals that aren't yet evident in the economic activity statistics. First, I do think that, while process, nobody would dispute the fact that considerable deleveraging has taken place household sector.  Profit in cash, and profit margins are high.  The banking system is stronger than it was a few so credit availability is regulation, ex the fiscal cliff, given that the election has passed.  So you may Obamacare, but now I both directly in terms of the rebound in energy output and also improved the relative just seeing the tip of the iceberg in terms of big capital spending projects for things like petrochemicals or housing side, the implications for

Higher home prices will consequences in terms of reducing the proportion of households that are that are underwater I think an improving more generally and of mortgage rates. judged by the have favorable underwater on their mortgages.  And as we reduce the number of households on their mortgages, we probably should see more refinancing activity. housing sector should also lead to an improvement in credit availability enable more households to take advantage of historically low levels put all of these factors together, I think back to the 2001 to 2003 period.  If you headwinds were restraining economic activity, and everyone was getting economy wasn't growing.  And then, for some reason, in estimate of real GDP was more than 8 percent at an annual it was revised down.  I went back and looked at the Fed transcripts, and it for about three or four meetings in a row, there is this big economy is going.  Now, I am not forecasting 8 percent GDP growth.  But I think that we can't rule you can occasionally be surprised by get resolution of the fiscal situation, I think we are not going to know which When I remember, back then sort of discouraged by the fact that the the third quarter of 2003, the first rate-subsequently was interesting.  Every meeting upward revision in terms of how fast the GDP growth.  I am not even forecasting 4 percent out a meaningful pickup in the economy if all of these factors come together in a meaningful way.  And I think the 2003 experience is evidence of how things.  But until we of these two paths is more likely, or something in between.

But with a bad outcome, if we down the wrong path in terms of fiscal for some time.  The bad credible plan B for what

I don't think just saying credible policy for us.

pretty much with everybody else:  I don't see any meaningful signs of incipient or manifest.  I was struck by the third-quarter economic productivity and costs.  Unit labor costs on a year-over-year basis are essentially flat, at an annual rate.  We will probably see an upturn in the fourth quarter, because growth will be really lousy due to the drought and the hurricane.  The underlying costs is extremely benign. On inflation, I am inflation pressure, either release on up 0.1 percent productivity trend for unit labor negative effect on activity in the was a rather different kind of storm, in the sense accounts for something on the order of 10 to 15 percent of GDP in the good portion of the District was essentially shut down for a week or more.

It is very hard to add them all up and figure the effects versus the rebound effects.  But I think that the disruption of Superstorm Sandy obviously had a very meaningful Second District, as it did in Charlie's District.

At our last meeting, we discussed the rather puzzling disconnect that upbeat readings on consumer spending and confidence, and the business sector's pessimism, reflected in surprisingly contacts.

Unfortunately, the resolution has largely come about through softer data on consumption and diminished readings on consumer confidence rather than a brightening that as a result, the near-term outlook, on balance, is weaker.

So as I listened, I concluded an acceleration of the recovery over the next year, year and a half, or two guess there are three sets of possible reasons.  One is that you think that there is a a kind there is a balance sheet problem that needs to be overcome.  The second kind of that there are structural problems that have been created by or accelerated by the growth potential is down.  And the third, which about today than at any time before is, quite apart from those two things, the due to the fiscal cliff, which is just holding people back.  I just want to with a little bit on consumption patterns and deleveraging as well. MR. TARULLO.  Thank afternoon, I think it is pretty clear there is not a significant divergence in expectations for the performance that to the degree there are differences, there are more differences in what may be holding back further recovery, or years.  And I shortfall in aggregate demand, and until that shortfall is filled up, there is still going to be of sluggishness to the recovery.  A corollary of that may be the notion that in financially induced serious recessions, the recovery period is longer because policy instruments are a bit more attenuated when explanation is crisis and the recession, and, therefore, economic we heard a lot more enormous uncertainty make a few observations on each of those explanations with particular reference to the labor market, but

I think for the first time we saw the fiscal cliff concerns rear their head in of thing Richard was I read beneath some of the consumer surveys and saw that one about the fiscal cliff.  Having said that, though, it seems to me that the recent hard to see sustained As Janet said, the consumer-household area.  To this point, we have mostly seen the sort talking about, which is businesses holding back investment.  That the fiscal cliff was a factor seemed particularly right when out of four respondents had spontaneously noted the prospect of higher taxes as a reason why they were nervous consumption dip is probably not just about uncertainty.  For one thing, it is

The saving rate has already come down 2 full percentage significant increases in consumption until wages start to rise, even if the fiscal situation is resolved sensibly, because people are points, and it is not clear how much lower it is going to go.  There is a bit of a wealth effect, as Betsy noted, but that is kind of unevenly distributed over households.

are still with us, closely aligned with what Bill I mentioned earlier this what the norm should be because the I did say this morning, if you just took a trend from 1975 to 2000, and extended it out to 2012, that is just about where we actually are now debt-to-income.  Assets, of course, bounce around a good bit more than debt in noncrisis you measure it, the ratio of assets to income seems to that Betsy was just talking about.  And, of course, on top of that, you have to look at and financial obligations ratios are at very low couple of decades.  So even if you subscribe to the view that it is hard to these factors suggest that we should effects of arguably the most important ways in which those kinds of recessions Moving to the deleveraging question and to what degree the headwinds thereby slowing everything down, I found my own thoughts very said, which is-I think, Bill, you were saying this-that although deleveraging in the household sector is continuing, we actually may be entering the final turn there.  As morning-I maybe didn't say this piece of it-household debt-to-income levels are back down to about the levels they were in 2004.  It is hard to judge 2001-07 period had so much excess credit, but, as line with periods, basically because of movements in the securities market.  So it is harder to do even a simple projection.  But depending on how be at least approaching pre-crisis levels, a movement that should be accelerated by the housing recovery what people actually have to pay on a monthly basis to service their debt.  And with interest rates as low as they are, the household debt service levels relative to the last recover quickly from financially induced recessions, all of be seeing waning

One qualification would be that while new foreclosures are creeping down toward pre-crisis levels, serious delinquency balances on mortgages are still elevated well above pre-crisis levels, even though they have good, or at least look increasingly better, when you look at I think that it is still a bit misleading because it is pretty clear that both credit are not flowing in anything like the amounts that they were no one around this table would want them to be flowing in the good ways short of an optimal new normal, and I think that is due to some combination of continued caution by lenders; the putback risks, which said, at least to some degree, new and a little bit will be facing at least a nontrivial headwind for while. But if things look pretty household balance sheets, mortgage and revolving pre-crisis.  Now, probably amounts that they were immediately pre-crisis, particularly with respect to mortgages.  But it seems almost certain that we are a probably several people have mentioned; and, as Betsy just anticipated regulatory responses.  And that, I think, feels as though it is going to take longer to work its way through.  So we probably a

and the labor market, where all of these things come It is where I think we are most likely to see structural problems; it is where the output we have seen some of the uncertainty A couple of specifics first.  I would put a qualification on what Jeff said about the unemployment falling down to 7.8 percent.

On this issue of skills and labor mismatch and the like, indexes not show very much, if any, structural damage in the economy.

It is notable that all of the improvement in the last six months is attributable to the improvement in the core unemployment rate, half of which itself is due to the reduced participation rate in the reasons is still about double the level that prevailed pretty crisis, and that, again, I think is a very direct measure of slack because these are people whom the companies want, but confidence about demand.  Wage is not on an upward trajectory, as is typical during recoveries-not even the relatively weak and 2002 recoveries, much less those in the mid-1970s and the early 1980s.  And there is just no sign of real wage pressures. market is still taking a back

Again, I yet whether these are just the effects of a very prolonged recovery or going crisis hit. Having said that, though, like Narayana, I keep looking at the month, when BLS comes out with the JOLTS report.  And I don't want to attribute this observation to Narayana, but it may be that what he was referring to is the fact that although the line now seems roughly what I think we can't know is whether that is just a slower adjustment back to the original Beveridge curve, because this or whether there has been some structural change in the economy. the JOLTS reports have great and that quits declined for a think it is hard to know whether it is the continuation of a reduced dynamism that was observable in labor markets back a decade or more before the we've seen this year one that reflects simply some what Eric said about the UI benefits going away sooner than they might years ago?  Until we have some clarification out what increase in jobs is really showing many it is going to take to bring the unemployment rate go up a few months, when getting better, because then we will see whether we get an influx of who were previously discouraged back into the labor market, which would suggest it is Finally, there is the participation rate issue, which is sort of our new little labor market conundrum.  Is the participation rate decline noise because people leaving may have left the labor market a little sooner than we originally anticipated because of have thought?  Or is the participation rate actually, on a secular basis, declining more than the demographics alone would have suggested a few around that, it is going to be a little hard to figure robustness in the labor market and how down.

So putting all of that together, it seems to me that the case demand is still a fiscal cliff.  And, again, I don't want to discount the possibility of structural damage, particularly in labor markets, but even if that is the case, it is not something that is going to be quickly.  It is something that is going to reveal itself as unemployment goes down, as the people working part-time begin to work full-time, and as which we have seen to date.

Looking at the glass as half full, there's net worth is now approaching the level it had reached before the financial crisis cracked the nest eggs of many households.  Net worth has been driven up over the past few gains in the value of homes and equities, and at the same time that these household assets have increased in value, household debt has been reduced.  In particular, home been on a downward trend.  All told, the value of household net worth stood at $64.8 trillion at the end of the third quarter.

Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Stein.

December 11-12, 2012

with being a little bit more long-winded tomorrow. MR. STEIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Once again, many of my observations about the outlook have been eloquently exposited by others around the table, so I'll be brief in the hope that I can get away percent at the end of 2013 versus the figure in the Tealbook.  The story I would tell is that I expect things, as it sounds like fiscal cliff dissipates, or at least as the worst case outcomes are taken off the people have mentioned in housing and autos, in and in the balance sheets of nonfinancial firms-begin to assert themselves. get up off the sidelines and step up a bit on hiring and investment spending.  So even fiscal drag in late 2013 and going into 2014, I would expect economic growth 3 percent range, which would start to make a dent in In terms of a modal forecast, I may be just a touch more optimistic than the Tealbook.  I had forecast unemployment to be about 7.4 or 7.5 7.8 percent many others do, to be slow over the first half of 2013.  And then with some luck, as the uncertainty from the table, the underlying positives-again, that many credit availability, Businesses with the remaining to move up into something like the unemployment.

I'd like to make here is that this scenario, even if it's the most I think is the most relevant for us in terms of thinking about the at the moment.  I think the scenario we need to be a little bit less likely, is the where we wake up six months from now, and we wake up again a and we're not really seeing clear signs of progress.  Rather it is still in the 7.8 percent to 8.2 percent neighborhood, and, can tell, six months from now and a year from now, the forecast six months further But really the only point likely case, is not the one that policy choices that we're actually facing visualizing and wrestling with, and it's one that strikes me as only Groundhog Day scenario.  It's year from now, and in each case, unemployment is not 7.5 percent any as best as we out looks like it's more of the same.

December 11-12, 2012

haven't really learned from the data over the last few years.  So it would be a lot to expect that Perhaps, following on the somewhat disappointing news about consumer sentiment we saw will be some lingering pessimism.  Even if there's somewhat of a I think both Dudley alluded to, you could imagine that even with a going to be some fiscal drag, and maybe the fiscal multipliers going to be a little bit higher than we anticipated, or Europe will be a Moreover, in the scenario I have in mind, it's not due to any obvious terrible shocks that we can point to, but just due to some muddled mix of small disappointments.  And as Governor Yellen suggested, these kinds of disappointments would be just enough to make inferences about efficacy kind of tricky.  There's this little bit of background noise, and we that much about efficacy we would learn much more about it in the next 12 months.  What would those disappointments be? in Friday's release, there resolution of the fiscal cliff, people will feel incompletely satisfied by that.  Or as President Williams and Vice Chairman reasonable resolution, there's associated with that are little bit weaker, or something along those lines.

really reasonable metric that there has been meaningful progress in the labor market And to the extent that the Tealbook is the modal outcome at that point, I think that the scenario I'm sketching a fraction of a standard deviation on the pessimistic side.  So as I said, I think this case one we really need to be wrestling with, and at some level, the whole framing of our opena this scenario?  And, second, once we figure that out, how do we and time-consistent Again, the situation I have in mind is one where it's the end of 2013, and we can't argue by any outlook, much less the actual state of the labor market. calling for 7.8 percent as is maybe is the ended asset purchase strategy, to me, hangs on two questions:  What do we want to be doing year from now, if we are in solve backward from that point and explain it to markets in a coherent fashion?  I hope that we'll spend some time on that tomorrow.  Thank you.

Now, when I realized that that put me outside the central tendency in the SEP, I resisted the higher only than President negotiations.

I'm going to flirt with Bill Dudley's challenge you-that these negotiations will be as 2011 debt ceiling standoff.  The 2011 situation was really a war of It was about the debt ceiling and, to some extent, about discretionary spending.  It spending in a serious way.  It was, all in all, kind of a self-inflicted exercise is a war of necessity.  The expiration it unavoidable, and this time a whole lot more is at path will be some kind of a short-term government open, raise the debt ceiling, and then set in place a and control future The House majority has made clear that it intends to use the debt ceiling There is every reason to think-and here to make a prediction and then ultimately disappoint messy as the summer of choice: wasn't about entitlement wound, and sort of beside the point.  The current of the tax and spending provisions makes stake.  As others have said, I think the most likely agreement to raise taxes, keep the legislative process to take place throughout 2013 to reform the tax code entitlement spending.

In fact, I actually think that we stuff is very hard and very important, and if it's not painful and messy, as a leverage point again.  All in all, it could be as much as a full more-of very messy negotiations, and that will mean further blows to consumer and business confidence, a should both expect and welcome this outcome; the last thing we need is a quick kick of the can down the road.

My industrial contacts report nothing but and significant layoffs in the coming months. I think we're already seeing aspects of this narrative.  The consumer has been the bearer of our hopes these last few months, and some parts of the consumer story particularly around houses and cars, but spending And then last Friday the expectations for business conditions one and five and for employment.  These are still high confidence levels compared the delta, much signal, but at a minimum it's a serious downside risk.  And, of course, the interesting question is, what brought this change on?  Developments in the real economy do not explain the change.  It has to be the fiscal negotiations, but they've only coming in the second week of December, it could be a long indicated, it may be less higher taxes coming, in which case most of the blow could be now.  But there are other signs of weakness:  I across the board; capital weakness

December 11-12, 2012

is that I don't see a lot of momentum going into 2013.  I don't see a growth year without fiscal headwinds, and I certainly don't see it with fiscal I would characterize as my medium-term optimism.  I know for progress in the second half, but I really do think that a successful outcome in the more important than getting back on track quickly in 2013.  And for anyway.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I hope that if I I see those issues and how I plan to communicate about them, assuming go in that direction, it might sharpen the discussion tomorrow and help make it more rules and other simple-minded policy guides.  This is a cost-benefit analysis that we have actually going to do a little bit of math here, just to keep my All right.  What I'd like to do with my time here is talk about our policy talk a little about how we productive.  One very basic point is that we are well past the point where we are going to use Taylor to continually reexamine, and I am hand in.  But it is going to be useful in my discussion.

And I am using will assume throughout that we are in a region where the marginal is as we increase stimulus, so is negative.  Costs are increasing in the size of the is increasing.  In other words, the I will assume that employment, I will take as a proxy for Let me just take a minute-everyone have the handout?-to talk about the framework B , and costs, C . Benefits depend on macro outcomes-employment and inflation-which indirectly depend on the amount of x to stand for the size of the balance sheet, so that is my proxy for the amount of stimulus.  Costs are a function of the size of the balance sheet. For the marginal benefit, I benefit is positive-more stimulus, all else equal, is helpful.  But the marginal benefit declining B โฒโฒ balance sheet, and marginal costs are increasing.  So as we move further and further into uncharted territory, the marginal cost, as best we can estimate, drawbacks are increasing.

Optimality just says-the next line-that marginal I want to make here, which I'm triggers for modifying or ending our asset I will talk a little bit more about how we can do implicitly differentiated the first-order condition there, and there's at percent chance I got it right.  [Laughter] Now, the presumption is that we will learn more about benefit, costs, efficacy, and other factors as x information about either benefits equal marginal cost, and that is what defines x *, the optimal size of the balance sheet. And the optimal employment level depends on x *.  A key point going to come back to, is that as we talk about the purchase program, we don't want to set a fixed number.  We want that number to depend on the benefits and costs as they evolve over time, and that going forward.  Now, I least a 50

So dx dg / is negative; dx de-/ that is, changes in the perceived efficacy-turns out to have ambiguous effects on how much we do, because there is sort of a substitution in income effects, and

I'm going to do now is two things.  The first thing I want to do is just general points about the case for moving from here:  What are the benefits and I just want to make a few observations All right.  So what make a number of costs as we assess them at the current point in time?  And

December 11-12, 2012

the things that have already been discussed, but I hope to introduce some I am going to argue, basically, that at this point in time further to be warranted.  But then, in the second part of my remarks, I want to avoid what I consider to be the trap of having a fixed objective for to keep buying forever for no purpose, which certainly we don't want about a number of novelty into that.  And accommodation is likely talk about the exit and how we can begin to communicate-and I plan to communicate to the public and to the markets-in a way that will allow us to deal with different cases.  In particular, it will allow us to unemployment that would, in the Groundhog Day scenario that Governor Stein was talking about, force us essentially to do.

We years into the are our current best guesses of where the the forecast makes a clear case that we could improve on both providing more accommodation.  That's a point we have discussed quite I would just reiterate it-and, again, that's the right way to look at it, not in terms for example.  I would add a few comments about that.  First, while it is true that come down quite a bit, I think that the unemployment rate probably way I think about that is, suppose I told you the 7.7 percent and asked you to guess, based on history, what part-time growth is, et cetera.  I think you So let me just talk briefly about benefits and observations.  Again just looking at the benefits side-holding constant or ignoring for the moment the costs of the policy-there is a clear have expectations of high unemployment and inflation below target for many future.  Admittedly, the forecasts are uncertain, but they economy is going.  I think that sides of our mandate by a bit here, and of Taylor rules, unemployment has understates how weak labor markets are.  The unemployment rate was employment is, what labor force participation is, what wage would give stronger numbers than are actually the case.  That is, conditional on the

It has declined percent rate over the last 12 months to a 1 percent rate over the last three months.  So unemployment rate that we're seeing, many other indicators weaker than you would expect.  That is something that can be detail, and I don't claim to have done that.  On the inflation side, we expect it to be stable.  While the staff expects inflation to stay around 1.6 to 1.7 percent, I'd just note that the pattern of inflation has been toward deceleration.  That is, the at an annual rate, and deceleration. about half of the index, and which is supposedly from a 2 that's the case for more accommodation.

'Efficacy Assessment.'  It doesn't matter if we need to do it.  Just a few comments.  First, the memo yields and mortgage rates have come since September.  There are other channels as well, such as the exchange rate, was mentioned earlier.  So I think that the evidence suggests that we still have the ability conditions.  The question arises-and it was raised, I think, by President are, that time.  But there are some factors working and to the extent that higher house prices make mortgage credit more available, effective.  Lower interest rates may be transmitted more and more Then, number 2 under 'Benefits': more accommodation, if we don't have the tools that the staff offered on MBS purchases noted that MBS down quite a bit which to affect financial Pianalto-whether these effects are weaker now than they were in 2009.  And perhaps they because financial markets were more disrupted at in the other direction.  In particular, to the extent that credit availability is improving, for example, monetary policy might become more broadly.  As Governor Duke described, higher house prices create more home equity spending power.  So I think there are some arguments in the other direction for efficacy.  Finally,

December 11-12, 2012

would note that the program being proposed has the same duration as a nine-year average duration of purchased securities.  That is about double what you believe in the duration theory of efficacy, that is an argument. just one other comment-I the MEP, about QE1 and QE2 had, and if

I see them at this point, again, just trying to make I won't say much about that.  I think the staff work over the last few really reduced our concerns there.  We are not seeing any signs of market costs, market dysfunction is something we can see pretty much in real Let me talk a little bit about the costs as a few points that may not have been emphasized up to this point.  Market function is something we have talked about; meetings has dysfunction.  The size of the Treasury market obviously is protection against that issue.  And unlike some of the other time.  And if we see it, of course, we can respond to it.  So let me not spend much time on that.

I think that looking at years without remittances or looking at the size of the deferred asset really For example, according to this the expected remittances in the baseline over the 14-year period between 2012 a money loser because we are assuming a purchases now because we are assuming that Treasury term of actual remittances is an average of $7 billion year, and you can compare that with the last four years, where we have remitted $280 billion These are not large numbers in terms of actual flow rates of remittances.  For $13 billion per year.  But, still, the averages are well above On the fiscal issue, I very much appreciated the presentation that was made this morning on the effects of interest rate changes and so on, on our balance sheet.  But the number of intuitively overstates the economic significance of those effects. memo, in terms of and 2025, the $1 trillion in additional purchases is negative NPV on Treasury premiums will go up.  But that being said, the difference between no additional purchases and the $1 trillion in additional purchases in terms per to the Treasury. the 100 basis point shock, the difference between the two cases-the no purchases and the $1 trillion in purchases-rises to

December 11-12, 2012

we are still remitting at a rate that is quite defensible.  I also think, of course, won't rehash it-that even in the most adverse cases, alternative scenario in which the 10-year yield rises close to 7 percent, the federal ratio falls.  So, from an actual economic point of view, I think that it is very hard to is bad for the taxpayer. historical rates, and the important point was made-and I including the debt-to-GDP make the case that this deal

On that issue, I would just make a couple of comments.  One is that, from can point out that we have already made We also have some ability to affect the pattern of remittances, and, it is a good idea to think about communication.  In particular, we might able to do something like find a way to smooth the remittances a bit more to avoid both a fiscal point of view, I find it very difficult to problem as a major one, as long as you believe that there is still going to be some benefit economy.  A final observation is that I think we are actually kind of hedged on issue in the following sense:  The scenarios in which interest rates rise and we have capital the scenarios in which the economy is doing better and, therefore, rates are rising.  And from a political communications point of view, it is going to be a 'Well, maybe we didn't pay remittances last year, but the economy is doing Now, admittedly, there are serious communications issues, and I appreciate that point being raised earlier. the point of view of communications, I think we $280 billion in remittances.  And any kind of long-term average of our remittances will be quite favorable historically. indeed, as was pointed out, by not selling securities, we can avoid long periods of no remittances. All that said, I think that even be the peaks and the troughs.  And there may be ways to do that, which we could manage; I think it's certainly worth thinking about that.  But from see this for the broader this losses are also most likely interest lot easier to say, much better, and our policy has contributed to that.'

December 11-12, 2012

is a legitimate concern.  On the issue that President Pianalto and which is that we might face a situation where interest rates rise sharply beginning to tighten If you look at the you look at the Blue Chip forecast, as the period of tightening comes yields rising-the baseline here assumes that the also rising over time.  So at the time that we begin to sell or begin to show signs adjustment will have already taken place, and that reduces the risk what the future path of the federal funds rate going to be after the initial increase.  Here we are telling the public presumably under what That has certainly got to provide some comfort going to rise more quickly than expected.  And, third, just a point made before, don't have to sell.  If we are concerned about that, we can normalize Treasury securities and MBS in the five- to sixrange, and that they will just roll off without any action on our part.  So, issue is one of the more serious ones; I don't want to in any way say it is not a I do think there are some things to take into consideration as we think about I would like to make one more observation, which is just for your information, that the done some work on reserve requirements.  Apparently, the Federal Reserve Act gives Let me turn to exit.  What I mean by 'exit' here is just balance sheet normalization ultimately, which clearly Governor Yellen raised, at the point of exit-again, certainly a legitimate concern-let me just make a couple of points that might be helpful.  First, according to all our plans, we don't anticipate at a time, or to sell at a time, when interest rates are as low as they are now. Tealbook's baseline, or if closer in time, you would expect to see 10-year term premium is of tightening, a lot of the somewhat.  Second, as Governor Yellen pointed out, communication can certainly help here.  In 1994, the problem was that nobody had any idea was conditions or on what date rates will start to rise. that rates are not which is that we actually the size of the balance sheet, although not the composition, in about the same amount of time, taking advantage of the fact that we hold lots of year expected maturity again, I think this serious issue.  But that risk. staff has

It is not one in fact, a possibility.

is the most difficult.  We had some good discussion of that.  I think we have greatly upgraded our ability to monitor financial But that being said, and I am sure Governor Stein will agree, financial easily observable in real time.  You could have something being you don't see until it breaks.  So I do think that this potential cost is perhaps the that, as Governor Stein has pointed LSAPs actually increase financial stability, for example, by financial institutions and improving the balance sheets of nonfinancial Some of the financial stability concerns are more about low interest rates, which are a LSAPs per se.  I think it is very important that when we hear about froth or about easier covenants on bonds, we investigate the quantitative the systemic linkages?  I think who bears losses and who is at risk very big difference.  It is a very striking fact that the tech bubble collapse destroyed for the economy were much I would also note that currently come up in terms of stability, have not been an issue this I think the evidence shows is that when those economies are growing slowly, even if the Federal Reserve is doing LSAPs.  So I am The fourth cost is financial stability, which I think very stability issues. instabilities are not necessarily built up that most significant.  Again, just a few quick comments.  One is out in speeches, some aspects of increasing liquidity of firms. global phenomenon and not about anecdotes implications of them:  Who is at risk?  How big are the numbers?  Are financial institutions particularly at risk?  What are makes a more wealth than the decline in house prices, yet the implications less because it didn't have the same financial implications. international capital flows, which have time.  And what there is no interest in investing in them,

December 11-12, 2012

you're bearing with me; it is not too late, I hope.  What I wanted do in the first half of my was just offer some thoughts on the case for further action. glad remarks

I want to be very clear a number or let the markets will need to do, of course, for the outlook for the labor market, but we also you and talked with a number of you about, I have equal importance of trying to achieve a better costs as we go forward. Let me turn now to, I think, the more subtle question, which is the one that Governor Stein alluded to, of how do we talk about the exit?  And, again, what about is that we certainly do not want to put out a number or imply see a number that is the unconditional level of employment or unemployment at which we stop purchasing.  Instead, we have to do something more subtle.  What we is not only talk about implications of our policy have to talk about the ongoing evaluation of efficacy and costs.  In my press conference statement, which I shared with a few of time on those two issues:  the first being, again, the outlook for the labor market; and the second being that the Committee is going to continue to evaluate efficacy and framework that I laid out here, let me just talk about three cases as we go forward, assuming we undertake LSAPs.  Case 1 on the Progress,' is the easiest case.  If the fiscal cliff is resolved and if European for hiring; consumers are feeling better; and the housing sector is strengthening.  All outcome if we can avoid some of the hazards that I think is fairly plausible, we don't really to have, of course. Given that and given the that we might encounter handout, 'Seeing risks do not materialize, like others, I think there is a good bit of upside here, as the Vice Chairman mentioned.  We are seeing firms have a lot of pent-up demand for capital expansion, and perhaps of these things suggest the potential for a stronger that people have talked about.  In that case, one have a serious problem.  That is the case we hope

December 11-12, 2012

we are seeing the progress, what the math says, first, is it words, on the one hand, we feel richer, in some sense, because we were more a substitution effect-so those two go in different directions.  I would So if you assume that you actually get, looking at the equation for a given employment number.  So we can be very Likewise, if the reason that we are getting good outcomes is not efficacy but, rather, good things are happening in the economy-positive fiscal outcomes, et ceterais that you can actually do less in that case, because you achieve in terms of employment is going to be higher than you initially you are only partially offsetting the impact of the other factors with less asset case where things are positive, either because our policy works well or positive.  In that case, we can be relatively ambitious about our labor In fact, we could As we try to assess why because efficacy is higher than we thought?  There is kind of an income effect and a substitution effect.  In other efficacious-and that would make us do less.  But on the other hand, because the return to more action is higher, there is treat them as more or less canceling out. x *, the amount of asset purchases, is unaffected in this case, what employment, ex + g , for g , is a higher aggressive on employment and get good outcomes, but we don't have to do more on asset purchases. just because what the math says dx dg / is negative.  But even so, what thought because purchases.  So that is the because other factors are market outcomes, and, in doing so, we don't have to increase our purchases. decrease them a little bit in some circumstances.

case that Governor Stein mentioned, is the months, we wake up in a year, and we see no progress and no of small factors or maybe because the policy I think what we have to do in that case if there is no progress in a yearefficacy and costs-is, first, to presume that efficacy must be low; we A second case, which is the Groundhog Day one in which we wake up in six obvious explanation for it, other than maybe a lot isn't working well. again, in the context of

December 11-12, 2012

presumption.  Second, if the balance sheet is marginal cost of the balance sheet is rising and costs about efficacy and costs, then that is the bad case, I think we can set the predicate for saying we are not going to buy forever; we are going to a dead horse, so to speak. don't know for sure, but that would certainly be my so much bigger, and C โณ is positive, the certainly must be higher.  So if we are talking but wind down and try something else, maybe, but not keep beating concern I have heard from folks is that, well, goes badly-and Governor Powell suggested that.  In that case the year might be very poor; the labor market might not improve.  Are we forced to to try to offset that?  What the cost-benefit analysis says, is less than zero, remember-if you wouldn't do enough to completely offset that.  So what I would say, offset that kind of situation.  We are going to cannot fully offset that.'  And that would imply you.  Now, you might argue that we don't know for sure whether the at work is something exogenous or just a lack of efficacy.  But in either case, obviously, going to be less ambitious in terms of what you are trying to achieve. The third case, I think, is also interesting.  A suppose the fiscal cliff outcomes next keep purchasing and purchasing basically, is thatdx dg / g is really bad, you would do more.  But it is also the case that for example, in a press conference would be, 'The fiscal situation has been a major headwind.  I have said before that monetary policy cannot fully try to contribute, try to be helpful, but, again, we that, in that case, our objectives in terms of employment would be lower.  And that's what the cost-benefit analysis tells factor you are

with me on this topic.  I hope that it was helpful.  What I'm First, I think that there is a lot of subtlety to evaluating going forward.  I tried to make some arguments that add as having a fixed target in unemployment.  Rather, if we focus adequately on ongoing evaluation So thank you for bearing trying to argue, basically, is two things: the benefits and costs of this program some insight to that.  Second, we should not think of this program terms of employment or

December 11-12, 2012

and costs, we will then be able to adjust what we can achieve and what we have to do evolve.  And that gives me a good bit more comfort say, and I'll stop here, that I think that we need to costs.  Assuming we go ahead with this in both March and June As President the advantages of a flow-rate policy is that you the outlook changes or other conditions change. of efficacy in a sensible way, according to how things about this kind of program.  Let me just also take very seriously, internally, the review of efficacy and program, I would propose now that we put a separate item on the agenda that essentially would be a review of the efficacy and costs of the program.  We would try to do our best to see where we are and, based on that, make adjustments if needed. Bullard has pointed out a number of times, one of can, in fact, adjust it if it's still kind of early.  If folks are okay, go-round.  Then we'll go have we will have our policy discussion.  Bill. Again, thank you for bearing with me.  Let's see; let me ask Bill English to give the introduction to the policy dinner, and tomorrow

coffee break, labeled 'Material for FOMC Briefing on Alternatives.'  As I did at the October meeting, I'd like to start off current MR. ENGLISH. 7   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will be referring to the handout that was distributed during the Monetary Policy by taking a longer-term perspective, before turning to the specifics of the meeting's policy statement.

In fact, the median of their expected stopping dates is the first quarter of 2014, and the median expected level of the unemployment rate when purchases stop is a wide range of views both about the stopping date time, and, as Simon noted earlier, the dealers put range of total purchase amounts.

Taking change in one of projections did not differ 11 of volume of purchases than the staff assumed and 4 who judged that purchases should be smaller.

As noted there, the difference probably economy; indeed their unemployment forecasts were the Tealbook's.  Instead, the dealers' larger purchase totals could reflect their belief that the Committee will follow a more-aggressive appear to think.  Alternatively, the dealers may be are that concerns about the efficacy the program earlier than would otherwise have been the case.  All that said, it's important to remember that the dealers are highly uncertain about the ultimate level of purchases, and incoming information.

The blue dotted lines show the results of policy of alternative C; the unemployment rate at the end of The exhibit on page 2 depicts staff simulations based on the monetary policies envisioned under the three alternatives, including for the federal funds rate.  The black solid lines show the results for under which the unemployment rate (in the middle panel) falls to about 6ยฝ percent the end of 2015, with inflation (shown in the lower panel) running somewhat below your 2 more-accommodative balance sheet policy and forward guidance assumed under alternative A.

yet improved 'substantially' and that the economy continues to asset purchases. recently, on balance, it remains elevated, and gains in payrolls have been moderate of late.  And while the housing sector has shown further signs of improvement, business fixed investment has slowed.

The word 'initially' has been included regarding the pace of purchases going forward. alternative B is essentially unchanged. In the third paragraph of continue purchasing MBS and that it will purchase longer-term Treasury securities 'initially to signal a high degree of flexibility The fourth paragraph of

Overall, the response in relatively small, although investors economy continues to improve, perhaps leading to some rise in adoption of numerical thresholds is likely would happen at this meeting.  Thus, the numerical thresholds in paragraph 5 would be somewhat unexpected.  However, market would likely be tempered by the indication in the statement that the Committee regards the thresholds as financial markets to alternative B would likely be might see the use of 'initially' in paragraph 3 as suggesting a greater readiness to trim purchases if the longer-term interest rates.

And second, in the language improvement in the outlook for the labor market, the Normally when we change things, for a reason.  So I'm just curious what your thought is in terms of what people VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I have two questions.  One, why do you think the 'initially' would be taken as one-sided rather than two-sided?  I mean, in the context of the fiscal cliff being resolved in a symmetrically.  I'm just not sure how that's in brackets in B, 'it sees a substantial asset purchase program ends'-where the additional conditions are put in-how do you think the market would interpret the motivation for putting that in? we change things would draw from that.

On 'initially,' I agree, it could be taken either way.  I guess I thought it MR. ENGLISH. would be most likely seen as a way of softening the commitment, and, therefore, the direction

It's just a way of putting for the purchases and the guidance for the federal funds some on the Committee might find useful. On the extra words in alternative idea there would be increased.  Because there is a risk that there will be some conditions for ending purchases extra words were intended to make it a accommodative for a considerable time after it stops purchasing.  So it spells that out:  'a considerable time after asset purchase program ends, and the economic some daylight between the guidance rate, which we thought

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So what inference would you think market participants would draw from that insertion-a longer period of time between asset purchases ending and interest rates rising?

of paragraph 5 B.  This sentence says, 'In determining how long to maintain a highly will be confused, too:  Is that sentence intended to be after the thresholds are hit, or is it intended to describe the MR.

confused by it:  In paragraph 2, we talk a medium-term 2 percent inflation objective; yet in paragraph 5, we talk about a longer-run of inflation of 2 percent.  Is it longer run or medium run? MR. FISHER.  Just one small point, although I'm about goal

The sentence in paragraph 2 is saying, if you wanted to really spell it the medium term is likely to run at or below the Committee's 2 percent objective, as a MR. ENGLISH. out, that inflation over longer-run objective for inflation.  So it's using 2 percent, the longer-run benchmark and saying that in the medium term, which is presumably sooner, you're expecting

figure.  So I think there actually is a distinction 2 and the Committee's longerthe inflation rate to be at or below that 2 percent being made between a forecast over the medium run in paragraph run objective of 2 percent.

raise that question because I worry that it could create some confusion. 'no more than ยฝ percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent What I that we're shifting a little bit here, and particularly when we introduce the above the longer-term goal. MR. FISHER.  I And then we talk about longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.' worry about is ยฝ percentage point this, Mr. Chairman, it seems to me, depends on your press conference.  You've I'm assuming-just to cut to the chase here-that it must be geared toward an alternative, that it must be geared toward a variation of this alternative.  And if we go itself you explain it at the press conference, and we got a very this exercise you put us through earlier. A lot of already drafted that; it has been vetted.  Some of us haven't had the privilege of seeing those drafts. and I would assume down this path, we have to be very, very careful that it be well articulated.  The statement isn't sufficient, even though we try, by adding these sentences that other people have mentioned. To me this whole thing depends on how good insight into that by

you what I say about it.  I describe it, and then I The first is that-I exactly this way-these are thresholds, not triggers; in other words, it is an 'at least' the decline in unemployment is associated with weakening of the labor market-withdrawal, at CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I can tell say monetary policy, however, is not on autopilot.  And I make three points: don't say it condition, not an absolute trigger.  Second, I say that as we consider unemployment in this condition, we'll want to comfort ourselves that higher payrolls, hours, et cetera, as opposed to a participation declines, and so on.  And then the third part is about the fact that we're looking

December 11-12, 2012

we continue the low-rate policy.  Moreover, I would add that in my efficacy and cost, which is more directed toward the LSAPs than to the costs concerns.  So I think I'm more explicit about what we'd be there isn't a simple mechanical formula.  That's the thinking. the projection of inflation, which means that we'll have to make judgments about where inflation is likely to be, assuming general discussion of thresholds, I mention that financial developments are in the list here because one of those obviously is financial stability looking at and why

MR. FISHER.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Certainly.

President Bullard.

alternative A, alternative B, and alternative C.  Alternative B is sitting up here, and and south.  It's making me a little nervous that market are a fair amount off from where we are as a Committee or what we're thinking of. you would interpret this graph, or are you not as concerned about that? MR. BULLARD.  I'm looking at the first figure on page 1 of the handout, the dealer survey versus all the dots are down to the right expectations Is that how what this graph shows, but there was a graph in that looked at the average probability distribution of the dealers' going to come out in 2014 when the purchases are wide, all the way from less than $2.5 trillion to more than weight on figures that would be consistent with either alternative B or A.  As I tried to say at the end of my discussion of this first exhibit, there's a lot of shows their point forecast, but around that is a very wide confidence I think that means that they will be more likely to adjust what their expectations are MR. ENGLISH.  I think that's correct for Simon's briefing earlier today assessments of where the balance sheet is done.  The distribution there is very $5 trillion, with a lot of alternative uncertainty in the market participants' minds about where the purchases are going to end up. The top of this exhibit interval, and in response to incoming information.

December 11-12, 2012

We haven't seen that yet because the outlook really hasn't changed that a different view of what the reaction function MR. POTTER. much.  If the outlook improved a lot, similar to the handout, then if they didn't move their expectation back in, that would suggest they have is or the cost-benefits.

MR. ENGLISH.  Right.

Governor Tarullo. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.

answers to some previous questions have answered my question, MR. TARULLO.  Bill's which has accordingly morphed into a comment, which accordingly belongs tomorrow. [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I'll reread the transcript.  Governor Powell.

first corner of page 1-'Eight of you indicated that your balance sheet differ materially from staff's'-what would that do to the mass of the dealer MR. POWELL.  I am following up on Jim's question.  If the market were to read the bullet point in the lower-left projections did not expectations distribution that Simon talked about?

have to read all three of those bullet points.  That you were reasonably comfortable with what the staff was writing down; that's B.  Seven of you felt there should be more purchases than that, and four of you less. MR. ENGLISH.  I think they'd actually eight of alternative Given that, I think their distribution would move down.

very interested who the seven were as well. MR. POTTER.  They would also be

Yes, of course. MR. ENGLISH.

MR. POWELL.  Generally, though, it could move the distribution to the left.

December 11-12, 2012

that were associated alternative were a little bit higher, that would be confusing to them because, as Bill MR. POTTER.  If they saw that the unemployment rate forecasts with this said, they have slightly lower unemployment rates than the forecast that we have.

their unemployment rate for the fourth CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Do you recall what quarter of 2013 is?

I have it; let me see if I can find it. Well, while you're looking, President Bullard. would be about 7ยฝ percent. MR. POTTER. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay. MR. ENGLISH.  It is happening is that give more guidance on the policy rates, but we're not giving a similar guidance on the as somehow giving that kind of guidance? going to while, and then you're going to end the other.  What is it about our statement MR. BULLARD.  So, Bill, it seems to me like one of the things that we may balance sheet, or should I reread alternative B Because what we have in mind is:  You're going to end one program, then you're continue for a that's meant to give that sort of impression?

I'm sensing around the table is we have in mind that goes on for about nine months or a year on the balance sheet and goes on longer than I'm not sure that's being conveyed out there to the market, and we have this kind of a picture in the graph. MR. ENGLISH.  Sorry.  Do you mean on the timing or on the size of the purchases? MR. BULLARD.  I mean, what something that with the policy rate, but that's why

That sense of the relative timing of purchases versus the funds rate is Vice Chairman asked about a few minutes ago. MR. ENGLISH. conveyed qualitatively in the words at the very top of page 7 of the handout that Dudley

'The asset purchase program ends,' at that point? MR. BULLARD.

December 11-12, 2012

Yes. MR. ENGLISH.

MR. LACKER.  Paragraph 4.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Did you find the number?

It's 7.5 percent.  They moved down from 7.6 to 7.5 percent.  So they're MR. POTTER. at the lower end of the central tendency.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Duke.

minutes in the discussion of the SEP? MS. DUKE.  Bill, will this information about what all the participants thought about the balance sheet or the size of the program be in the a paragraph in the SEP write-up that goes through SEP on balance sheet expectations, and something like this information, MR. ENGLISH.  Normally we have the information from the I think, would be there.

MS. DUKE.

So that paragraph would include this information.  Okay.  Thanks.

MR. POTTER.

It was in last time, and they didn't seem to notice an inconsistency.

anything about the size of the purchases. MS. DUKE.  Well, last time it only said that 11 people expected to start purchases.  It didn't say

MR. POTTER.  That's right, but they should be able to do math and work out who those 11 could be.

I actually do think-and I'd be interested if Simon agrees-that MR. ENGLISH.  But they'll notice this information when it's in the SEP write-up.

didn't seem to notice last time. MR. POTTER.  Yes, they you going to describe the staff benchmark there? was my question. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  How are MR. TARULLO.  That

Only qualitatively. MR. ENGLISH.

December 11-12, 2012

MR. TARULLO.  So seven people think it's going to be higher than some unspecified benchmark.

you could say seven people think it's going to be 750. MS. DUKE.  Or

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Rosengren.

you looked at the central tendency of the voters that are voting guess is that that dot would be a good bit lower than the dot that you're showing can understand why the dealers are coming up with a different answer, which is that are is tied to that paragraph 4, and the difference between the forecasts that are shown in the economic projection.  So going to see those three dots for A, B, and C, but I do think that some of that both the forecast and people's reading of paragraph 4. MR. ROSENGREN.  One of the challenges that President Bullard showed with that figure, I think, is partly the result of the Tealbook being more pessimistic on the unemployment rate than most of the rest of us.  The central tendency is 7.4 to 7.7 percent for 2013, and the Tealbook is at 7.8 percent.  So if for this was, my right now.  I substantial improvement in labor markets doesn't look like something higher than where we now.  I think some of the inconsistency Tealbook and some of the rest of our they're not disconnection is tied to the differences in for Bill?  We obviously will have morning to continue.  Okay, we will adjourn. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any other questions plenty of time tomorrow

I'm sorry. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.

your MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I apologize.  I came in late.  Is it possible to make handout available on SDS?

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Absolutely.

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thanks.

December 11-12, 2012

at 8:30. you have any changes in your SEP projections, please provide those as soon as CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  We'll reconvene tomorrow morning Obviously, if possible.  A reception is now available upstairs, followed by dinner.  Thank you.

[Meeting recessed]

December 11-12, 2012

December 12 Session

go-round.  Vice Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good morning, everybody.  We've had our opening presentation by Mr. English, and so we're ready to begin our policy

I'm at the end; today I'm first.  Nobody I usually get to the end we're talking about dotting i's and and I think there are actually much more substantial things to talk about than that. get some housekeeping out of the way in terms of language.  I'll make two I think 'initially' in paragraph 3 is fine.  I'm not sure how the flexibility on our part, I would not include that bracketed language-not because I because I think it's going to confuse people about why previous meetings?  They are just going to try to figure out why we put this language in now when VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Normally wanted the first slot, but by the time crossing t's, Let me just comments on language:  First, market will react to that one way or the other, but it does signal greater and that's something worth signaling to the market.  And, second, on paragraph 5, we have the bracketed language, 'it sees a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, the asset purchase program ends.' object to it in any substantive way, but we're adding it.  What is special about this meeting relative to going to be confused; they're we didn't have it in before.  I don't have a strong objection to it, but my preference would be to exclude that bracketed language.

first issue I wanted to discuss is the question of that we don't really know the answer to this.  If the margin on which market the most powerful is the duration margin, then elongated Treasury purchases Let me talk now about substance.  The what type of asset purchase, Treasury or agency MBS, has the most bang for buck, and I think the honest answer is segmentation is presumably would have the greatest effect because the duration on Treasuries is higher than the duration on agency MBS.  But if the degree of segmentation is greatest across asset classes rather

December 11-12, 2012

MBS purchases may rank higher.  Also, segmentation is high in yields. contrast, if the agency MBS market were perfectly a great about how much market segmentation there is and the margin some question about what is the best asset class.  What to conclude It seems to me that because we don't really know which the more powerful margin is, agnostic.  So conducting purchases in both markets may be sensible.  It risk of disturbing market function.  By splitting the without actually affecting market function.  That lowers, in my mind, than duration, then agency general.  This also points toward agency MBS as potentially being more efficacious.  After all, if markets were perfectly segmented, Treasury purchases would just push down Treasury Everything else would remain unchanged.  In segmented, well, that wouldn't really be a particular problem.  Instead, the stimulative channel would just be confined to the housing market through the mortgage rate.  There's difference between being unclear by which it is.  It creates from this? we should be somewhat also might be sensible because it reduces the purchases, we can do more the potential cost of these purchase programs.

as the long-term Treasury purchases extension program.  I know that some people feel that we've been I see it, $45 billion per month is appropriate this time logically from what we've said in our September and October In those statements, we essentially said that we'd do whatever it takes to generate a in labor market conditions consistent with our price stability goal.  To Now, I know there's some discomfort with proceeding with the Treasury purchase program at the size of $45 billion per month, the same rate that we did under the maturity inadvertently backed into a corner where if we don't do this, we'll somehow disappoint market expectations.  My own view is that our decision has to rest not on market expectations, but on what course is the best one.  And as because it really follows statements. more rapid improvement dial back on that commitment now in the face of tremendous uncertainty about the outlook

December 11-12, 2012

commitment.  Not only would this result in an we believe we're close to our limits in terms of our already can purchase $45 billion of long-term Treasuries a month without any at this time, how would explain why we're going with a lower purchase rate?  Dialing back on the purchases a self-defeating strategy.  In fact, a reduction in the monthly purchase we will succeed; we'll have a better likelihood of being able to dial back our at a relatively early date.  Dialing back today would hurt the economy in a way that would, to me, seem to be reneging on our undesirable near-term tightening in financial conditions, but I think it would also be damaging because it would be taken as a sign that ability to generate additional monetary policy accommodation.  After all, we've demonstrated that we negative impact on market function.  If we were to go to a lower number we actually now because we might be uncomfortable with the size of our balance sheet at a future date strikes me as potentially rate might not lead to a lower terminal balance sheet size.  The stronger our commitment now, the more likely purchases might necessitate maintaining our purchases for a longer period with an ultimately higher resulting balance sheet.

good way and the economy improves.  As this would be able to dial down the pace of purchases relatively rapidly.  In this rather than alarming.  The scenario.  On the other cliff is resolved in a bad way and the economic recovery falters, then we have go with our purchase program?  I don't know the answer to this, but be to replace the Treasury portion of the purchase program with Now, at the extremes, there're two broad sets of possibilities in the coming months.  On the one hand, the fiscal cliff is resolved in a happens, we scenario, reduction in the rate of purchases would be reassuring reduction would be taken as a sign that we are becoming more confident about the prospects for sustainable improvement in the labor market.  That's a pretty simple hand, if the fiscal a problem.  How far do we the right approach might

December 11-12, 2012

what this would be, but like many others I committing to an open-ended Treasury purchase program indefinitely, I think the efficacy and costs really do matter here.  As I see afternoon-the rise with balance sheet size, and the program benefits presumably fall At some point these lines are likely to cross, and when that happens going to have to wrap up the program and then proceed with something else. something new later in 2013.  I'm not sure exactly don't feel comfortable regardless of the costs and benefits; it-and I'm very sympathetic with the Chairman's presentation yesterday program costs presumably with balance sheet size. we're is whether we should be apparent disparity between market expectations and our own expectations in dealer survey indicates an expectation of about figure compares with the I'm not sure that the difference is really you look at how SEP, there were more people greater than $500 billion than less than you actually translate that to voters it would even be more skewed to a larger number.  I don't think the difference is quite as big as $500 billion versus that I think this uncertainty may be resolved just by incoming I don't think it's important that we eliminate this disparity today; it can be very going forward.  In addition, there might be a low-cost way to manage cooperates.  The Chairman in his press example, could make it clear that the Treasury portion of the program would Another relevant issue in terms of our purchase program concerned about the terms of ultimate balance sheet size.  The primary roughly another $1 trillion expansion in our balance sheet, and this Tealbook forecast of $500 billion ending around midyear.  I personally don't think this disparity is big problem that we need to resolve at this time.  First, quite that big.  The Tealbook assumption is the Tealbook's assumption.  If people responded in the $500 billion, and I think if somewhat $1 trillion.  The second thing is information. easily managed expectations downward, especially if the economy conference, for likely be dialed down first as we became more confident about improvements in the labor market

December 11-12, 2012

wouldn't be $45 billion and then just stop at zero, but it might be size of the outlook.  So the program tapered down as economic conditions and labor market conditions improve.  And by communicating that, you actually would start to dial down expectations about the total program.

guidance, and really the primary reasons why I think thresholds make sense.  First, they're dynamic reached, and that provides an are better than date guidance I think that's important because it should enable a smoother exit when the time comes.  In guidance and then determine at some point that it is time to going to be a very big deal for market participants.  At that time there future tightening steps might be foreshortened, and could even be in a felt pressured to delay our decision of bringing in the rate guidance, and of As we've discussed, thresholds have two particular advantages over date these are with respect to expectations.  In response to data, market participants will adjust their expectations about the timing of when the thresholds will likely be automatic stabilizer function to the economy.  Second, thresholds because they remove us from the equation on a meeting-by-meeting basis.  I don't think we'd want to change our threshold values very often, if at all.  So that leaves the timing decision in terms of our exit to market participants rather than putting it on us on a meeting-to-meeting basis. contrast, if we stick with the date bring the date in, that's would be a risk that the entire series of market participants would bring back everything to the present.  This might cause such a decision to have a very large, discrete effect on financial conditions and on expectations, a bigger effect than maybe we might feel comfortable generating.  Confronted with that risk and the asymmetry of risk with a monetary policy operating at the zero bound, we position where we course, doing that would just make it a bigger deal when that day arrives.  It's better to put it on the markets to solve when we're likely to exit, and I think the thresholds do that in a good way.

December 11-12, 2012

I think we all agree that having just two parameters is much too simplistic, problem of agreeing on what the particular values for those parameters can be dealt by a press conference and by speeches that make it clear that the thresholds are indicative were to get strong evidence that the would change the thresholds or we'd change our I think we've already overcome.  Going back to our got down to the detail of what thresholds we would pick, there appeared to be a bit of as though that problem is less significant. Now, arguing against thresholds:  Thresholds are clearly not perfect.  There are two difficulties.  First, and, second, there is the would be.  But these problems seem less serious to me.  The too-simplistic problem with and are not binding and determinative.  In other words, if we thresholds weren't the right thresholds, then we behavior.  The second problem is one that previous conversations, while there was some disagreement about the efficacy of thresholds, when we consensus around 6ยฝ and 2ยฝ.  So it seems easing of monetary it being more earlier date guidance.  It's hard to imagine that people are going to view accommodation.  I suppose at the margin you could argue viewed as slightly more accommodative because they might be viewed commitment:  We obviously would be very likely to change going to be in some way more timeless.  So I accept that a very small change in expectations by moving to thresholds, but even if that were a bad outcome.  The perception of greater commitment Some have argued that thresholds could be construed as a further policy, and some might think that that's not desirable at the current time.  My own view is that if we move to thresholds, any effect on the perception of our policy in terms of accommodative would be very tiny.  After all, the statement is very explicit that the thresholds are consistent with our the thresholds as significantly more that thresholds might be as representing a somewhat stronger the date in the future, but thresholds are there may be true, I don't see why that's necessarily

December 11-12, 2012

more powerful, and, in current circumstances, that strikes me as a good should make the policy thing, not a bad thing.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard.

you, Mr. Chairman.  I have three comments on policy today: as the Vice Chairman. MR. BULLARD.  Thank First, briefly some practical concerns; second, some balance sheet comments; and third, comments on thresholds.  I'm going to follow the same formula course today and not draw attention to expects major action by the Committee at this meeting.  So the key question for look like, given the current policy On the practical side, my preference is to stay the monetary policy while fiscal policy is being sorted out.  I do not think that the private sector really wants or the Committee is, what does stay-the-course policy configuration?

me attempt to make the case for a go-slower approach to a more expansionary policy purchases tend to be more potent, especially The QE2 program, for instance, fall of 2010 Because the QE-style policy is more potent, it stands to reason that we for one with outright purchases if the goal is B with $35 billion and ask the communicate during the press conference that in the Committee's judgment for the Twist program.  I would also On the balance sheet, let balance sheet expansion.  First, I think that outright purchases are than the Twist program.  I have argued that the Twist program has only minor effects on financial conditions, on balance, but that outright with regard to inflation expectations and inflation itself. dramatically stemmed and reversed the then-insipient deflationary threat during the and the first half of 2011. do not need to replace the Twist program one simply to maintain the aggressively easy policy that we already have.  Accordingly, I suggest replacing the $45 billion Treasury purchase number in alternative Chairman to simply this is the policy-neutral replacement of outright purchases

December 11-12, 2012

and not go to MBS.  If the Committee wishes to maintain alternative B $45 billion, then we should claim credit for having taken an even easier policy.  Many of the going action, it is important not to disguise it as a mere replacement for a less-potent maintain it in Treasuries at effects of our policy actions come through signaling and expectations effects, and if we are to take an easing policy.

great advantage.  An open-ended QE program incoming data for cues as to how the Committee might shape the program going approach allows more data to arrive before perceived balance sheet Ideally, we want to find the right moment to taper or end argument that the situation require quite as much accommodation as it did previously.  This Governor Stein program under those quite damaging to the Committee's credibility going forward, and efficacious as I describe.  The great advantage of the go-slow approach a judgment that the macroeconomic situation has improved sufficiently The go-slow, $35 billion approach has a relies on forward.  A slower constraints begin to limit the policy. the program in 2013 or the first half of 2014 based on an economic has improved and does not approach is vastly preferable to the Groundhog Day situation described by yesterday in which the Committee is forced to abandon the program even though the macroeconomic situation has clearly not improved.  Ending or tapering the circumstances would be because the world is stochastic, we cannot really be sure what situation we'll find ourselves in even if the program is as is that the window for incoming information is wider, likely putting the Committee in a much better position to render to taper or end the program for economic reasons rather than for balance sheet constraint reasons.

I'm going to turn to thresholds.  I am willing to support the thresholds version of B; I have several remarks.  First, the current date approach has problems, but one of is that it sends a pessimistic signal that is, in fact, counterproductive to our Now alternative the key problems

December 11-12, 2012

you know, I've been use of calendar dates, and I'm happy to see it go in this version of the for the Committee in interpreting events.  I policy rate.  As part of I think that will go a long way to medium term.  I also think that the Committee should recognize and that the Committee gone up. will be tighter at that point.  It is important, as the Vice Chairman noted, a two-dimensional decision.  If we could vastly reduce the size of the Committee and the staff.  So it's concerning other variables, which is in alternative B.  I approach to monetary policy.  So it is important to eliminate that.  As generally opposed to the thresholds argument.  As a replacement for the date, the most prudent course for the Committee would be a more-qualitative style as outlined in the corresponding paragraph in alternative C. This option provides considerably more flexibility can appreciate, however, that some might feel that the qualitative approach does not provide sufficient commitment to the low policy rate and, therefore, want to have quantitative guidance, or they may feel that it provides the wrong kind of commitment to the low the adoption of these thresholds today, the Committee should plan to reaffirm in January 2013 the statement that was made in January 2012 to the effect of the inappropriateness of monetary policy attempting to directly target employment levels. reassure markets that this is not an attempt to directly target something that the Committee cannot control over the appreciate that these thresholds will, in fact, be regarded as triggers for action and that there's not too much that can be done about that.  In effect, the threshold draws a line in the sand.  If the line is crossed, something must be changing.  What is changing is the probability will take action.  So even if the Committee doesn't actually act, the probability has Markets will of necessity have to react to that change in probability, and whether we do anything or not, I think our policy that we don't get into the trap of saying that monetary policy is that was the case, important to include the language definitely think that we do not want to give the impression that this is a two-variable game.

December 11-12, 2012

that the staff memo on unemployment did a good job of summarizing going forward, the Committee Related to that, I thought the idea that the labor market is a multidimensional object, and will have to continue to emphasize that perhaps pretty strenuously.

B represents a balanced approach be forecasting years ahead.  I prefer to use actual values for inflation instead of the This aspect of the threshold formulation may cause problems for the Committee for that.  Policy has to be chosen in such a way so that years into the future.  There's a certain you say, 'Well only when I get a bad forecast will I change policy,' but you the good forecast.  That's a difficulty that we going to actual also going to be the possibility that market-based FOMC changed language concerning unwelcome declines in inflation.  If you I do not think the formulation as it stands in alternative to thresholds.  The unemployment reference is to the actual rate of unemployment while the inflation reference is to a forecast value.  No central bank would ordinarily inflation to be high several forecast value. going forward, and we should be ready the actual inflation forecast makes sense several circularity here where it's the policy change that is supposed to give haven't talked about and really haven't resolved here.  We could resolve it by values of inflation on the threshold.  I think markets, no matter what we say, are looking at actual values, especially if core PCE inflation went above 2ยฝ percent.  The Committee would come under heavy pressure regardless of what the forecast was, and we should be aware of that.  Finally, the Committee should be prepared for inflation expectations will simply pop up to 2ยฝ percent following this announcement or during the first half of 2013.  Actual inflation may then simply follow behind because expected inflation is the major determinant of actual inflation.  The threshold approach could be read as saying, in effect, that the Committee is willing to tolerate higher inflation, and markets may simply move expectations to the perceived ceiling.  Something like this actually happened during the 2003 period when the

December 11-12, 2012

going to conduct an easier policy. look at the inflation expectations during that period, they simply shifted up on a perception that the Committee was willing to tolerate higher inflation and was We should be prepared for that possibility and keep that in mind.

rid of the date is helpful by removing the a In summary, on the thresholds, getting counterproductive, pessimistic signal in my view.  However, a move to thresholds is far from panacea, and I expect this will require further refinement going forward.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Plosser.

Like President Bullard, I Increasing the size of the balance sheet is a relevant tool, as it leads to an increase in Regarding asset purchases, I noted that the Tealbook seems to suggest that purchases of the same monthly volume of Treasuries disagree. the monetary base and an increase in excess reserves.  These actions will require us to remove

As I've accommodation we do so.  This short-term securities on the balance sheet. continuously Unemployment has fallen 1 full percentage point points in the past two years.  Fortunately, inflation has remained relatively stable.  This is not an environment that to me obviously calls for argued previously, at this stage of the cycle, I think the costs of increasing outweigh the benefits.

also believe that, at best, it is premature to adopt the sorts of thresholds that are being adequate analysis of the full implications of such a an understanding among ourselves on the Committee as to how this enough consideration to the possible longer-term implications calendar-date guidance; I've been opposed to that ways.  However, I do not think the current for thresholds are yet ready for prime time.  Thresholds do complicate our I believe the public will fixate on the giving out inviting them to fixate on these numbers.  The public can very easily goal or objective, and believe that goal.  I find this proposition highly dubious, and it I proposed today.  I do not think we have done decision, nor do we have program would be implemented.  We should not, in my view, undertake policy actions and language changes without giving of these choices should the economy perhaps evolve in a way that we don't anticipate.  I do oppose and have been uncomfortable with the from the beginning.  I think it's deficient in many proposals communications rather than clarify our policy decisions. numbers in the statement rather than the words around those numbers.  Indeed, by specific numbers, we are interpret our unemployment threshold as a monetary policy the Fed has the policy tools to achieve that

Committee to set numerical goals for employment.  The public might also conveys the idea that we have a good relationship between these two variables, inflation and unemployment, and can would seem to contradict the Committee's statement in January, which explained why it is inappropriate for us as a wonder why we are attempting to target an unemployment rate when history tells us that when the Fed effectively tried to do so in the 1970s, it led to some very poor economic outcomes. Choosing inflation and unemployment thresholds knowledge of the predict the outlook for both with some precision.  That would be misleading.

view that forming the inflation threshold in terms of the inflation I alluded to yesterday, this assumes that we are able to predict inflation with I think economic research suggests that we can.  There are many details that and have not been discussed within this Committee, and a number of questions we while the inflation should be in terms of an Should both thresholds be expressed in Which a quarterly average, a two-quarter average? If the inflation threshold is given in Should it be based on the SEPs, the Tealbook, The public will want to know.  We need to be able to communicate to If we use the SEPs, what happens if we want to Whose outlook would we use then?  If we I'm also skeptical of the outlook would serve as a very effective safety valve if we got our unemployment threshold wrong.  Again, as more certainty than remain vague still need to answer.  The specification in alternative B suggests that the unemployment threshold should be in terms of an actual unemployment rate outlook.  What are the implications of such asymmetry? terms of outlooks or both expressed in terms of actual values?  The Committee has not had a thorough discussion of this point.  How do we operationally define these thresholds? unemployment measure is relevant:  monthly, Which is the number that we're supposed to be reacting to? terms of an outlook, whose outlook should it be? private-sector forecasts? them what are the metrics that we're using. make a decision between quarters when we do SEPs?

Would the Committee ever forecast inflation two goal or above the thresholds?  If we did so, would we If forecast of inflation is no longer a use FOMC forecasts more broadly, how would we handle situations in which our forecast deviates from the private sector?  Would such deviations undermine the Committee's credibility and the integrity of the forecast process itself? years out that was substantially above our be undermining our own credibility to deliver on the goals that we've laid out for ourselves? we're not willing to do that and risk our credibility, then the valuable safety valve.

But we have told Participation rates may be act?  If we choose in those circumstances not to react and not to act when the we choose to measure it, what would we do then?  Would we set old ones weren't the right ones and come up credibility once we had not acted on the first Indeed, the language of paragraph 5, highlights that the thresholds are specific points.  It then goes on in Why do we want the public to focus on those points when we then turn Even more important, the Committee needs to consider how it will react to rate of 2.6 percent while forward guidance, what are they telling us to do in that circumstance?  Would we take action? don't know the answer to that question, but the comments by Governor Tarullo and Governor Raskin suggested the different measures that may be valuable for the public to focus on the unemployment rate.  What will we do? falling.  Unemployment rates may be falling for the wrong reasons.  Would we be willing to pull the trigger and inflation rate was 2.6, however new thresholds?  Would we acknowledge that the with new ones?  Would those new ones have any one?

Why signal the importance of these numbers and then explain why they're irrelevant or at least nondeterminative in our cannot come to some agreement what such forward guidance or communication is and more recently from the DSGE model circulated for this meeting, that the stimulative effect of forward guidance expectations about how policy will be conducted have our cake and eat it, too. We need to engage in some scenario analysis to see if we ourselves have a common understanding of how we'll react in various situations.  If we and shared understanding, it's hard to see actually accomplishing, and our communications will be confusing.  More generally, we know from theory, as well as simulations from FRB/US results that were provided is largely determined by the public's after the thresholds are breached.  If we don't communicate that post-threshold reaction function, our forward guidance will not deliver the desired stimulus today.  But we seem to be unwilling to tackle the specifics of that reaction function.  Simultaneously, we seem to want to use the forward guidance to operate a stimulus.  We can't

If we act in response, it might smooth the going to react.  Alternatively, that anticipation might If we don't choose to react, then those anticipatory We also need to consider how the markets will react as we approach our numeric thresholds. threshold and rates might begin to rise well before we actually might be a transition as markets anticipate that we're force us to raise rates before we are ready. effects that occur as we march toward the threshold could lead to some instability because then

for rates and the consistent with what we are communicating.  If anything, the with our LSAP program, not about the funds rate.  Thus, we may be confusion in our forward guidance.  If we set thresholds for the funds rate, set of thresholds for our open-ended asset I believe that we're a hard time in distinguishing that guidance, and, frankly, that's where most of the Will consistent with the Committee's yesterday. Market participants do not seem to be misreading our intentions with respect to forward guidance and liftoff of the funds rate.  As we've seen yesterday, the liftoff forward guidance seem pretty charts we looked at yesterday suggest that market expectations may be misaligned intentions regarding the size of the addressing the wrong we are going to be asked, should we set a separate purchase program?  Why shouldn't the public ask and expect such forward guidance?  How do we determine those thresholds?  We've got some words around them, but going to have confusion is.  If we don't know how to do that, how is the public going to understand it? they make their own inferences?  And will those inferences be intent?  I thought we saw some divergence could go on.  My basic point is that there are a number of aspects of implementing a common understanding must be reached we can determine whether adopting such thresholds would be a useful policy approach, focused on trying to reach a consensus on how we'll when we return to a more normal economic environment and then talk I threshold strategy that need to be evaluated, and a before and if so, how to best formulate those thresholds.  However, I would prefer, and I think the Committee would be better served, if we conduct systematic policy about how we communicate and how we conduct policy at the zero bound.  That would make our communications much, much easier.

So I'm marathon, which on today's decision.  All I can do is comment and offer advice. would like to make one comment, which I'm sure will raise the hackles on some people's I've sat at this table for seven and a half years, a little bit less than many, but more than I'm struck at how we've become conditioned by so-called market expectations, meaning the dealer community.  And maybe I was in the markets for I urge our staff and the rest of us to operator on the street.  They're driven by and the insiders.  If you believe otherwise, I think you're naรฏve.

Dealers are like every other greed; their only interest is in their own profitability, their own income statement, and that of their partners informed by their expectations that were presented both yesterday by Simon-and, by the way, a very mind that market operators are driven solely by profits and their own book-running needs.  They want accommodation because it's a moneymaker for them.  And I think we can be led we base policy so heavily Fischer on the banks of the Hudson.  He learned that lesson late, but the point is, be very wary if we're going to rely on the dealers and those who are driven by interest.

Now, perhaps that's because I like to remind that Don Henley is a Dallas-ite, a Texan; I see him now and then-I just get glimpses of song's phrase: ''Relax,' said the you like, but you can should be mindful that we are bequeathing an engorged balance sheet to the and perhaps the next Chairman. cannot leave; they're going to have to deal with this.

They able to articulate this well-I've talked to the Chairman about it privately.  We have a fiduciary responsibility, and we have to be very predicament from which said this before:  We talk about not creating market disruption on the buy side, but I worry a great deal about it on the sell side.

I think we want to offer very quickly some has produced I would consider little conclusive reason to think that purchases of Treasuries have at all on the economy.  Empirical research, such as that conducted by Now, I'd like to turn to some general comments on what we know, or what know, about monetary policy at the zero bound, and then I specific suggestions concerning the policy options that are on the table.  Our theoretical and empirical models all tell us that the anticipated post-liftoff conduct of monetary policy is an important influence on how the economy performs today.  The Board staff numerous studies demonstrating the power of these efforts.  In contrast, our theoretical models give us what any direct impact Christensen and Rudebusch at the San Francisco Fed, is consistent with the proposition that these

I would just advise that that framework may I'd be knife to a gunfight. purchases matter only insofar would otherwise have been the case.  That is, Treasury purchases may not through the signaling channel.  The Chairman's benefit-cost presented yesterday be ill-equipped to deal with the situation as it is now, and I'd want to think it through, but careful about bringing a years from The MBS market running.  It's to the MBS market that I think your analysis, Mr. Chairman, may perhaps be the most usefully applied, assuming you asset-class emphasis, it may be very difficult to pull back from it or to asset classes in the future.  But it appears to be the drift going.  I'm not comfortable with it, but that's the goes for announcing thresholds, or indicative thresholds, as our Vice Chairman liftoff.  These findings have been broadly confirmed by Board staff studies, the latest being the memo on the current outlook and alternative this meeting. Current employment depends on expected future interest rate policy, which, if it depends on our Treasury holdings at all, depends on what people expect our holdings to be now when liquidity is again scarce.  MBS purchases are a different story. appears to be sufficiently segmented from other asset markets that our intervention there directly affects activity in the housing sector.  We've acknowledged that, and Governor Duke has been quite articulate on that in several meetings benefit-cost think it's proper for this Committee to focus on a specific asset class.  Bear in mind that once we do go down this path of resist political pressure to focus on other of this Committee that that's where we're given in my view.  We also know that postponement of date of liftoff has little effect on how the economy performs today, if it leaves the anticipated post-liftoff conduct of policy unchanged. The same mentioned, that have to be met before several policy rule simulations in EDO by Hess Chung, which was distributed for

The 19 men and women sitting around this table are simple policy rule, particularly in a world such you described, Mr. Chairman-I believe it was two meetings ago-when you said that we policy measures we've followed.  I may have paraphrased that, but that what I heard.  Now, that doesn't mean that comparisons of the SEP mediumof policy rules couldn't be informative. Yellen made a notable effort in this direction in a recent speech, although it was going from the general I personally would prefer that we not purchase additional Treasury I rather like what Mario Draghi said on Thursday, and I'll quote, not paraphrase: who created this situation in the first place.' feel the Fed was part of that creation by I think the message there, and I'll come end, Mr. Chairman, is that this question is best addressed by fiscal In my view, there are alternatives to traditional Treasury purchases that offer more reliable benefits and avoid many given that that's importantly, direct efforts to better communicate the latter point, I would encourage the communication subcommittee to be more ambitious in their proposals to reform the not likely to agree unanimously on a mechanical as really don't know how the economy is working right now and we actually don't fully understand the consequences of the was the essence of run policy path with the prescriptions of a variety Governor applied to primary dealer funds rate projections rather than the SEP.

I agree with President I do think that, through your press conference, you might mitigate that follows:  'To support continued progress toward maximum employment and Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy In other words, I agree with President Dudley that the range for the fed funds rate at 0 to ยผ percent and currently rate will be appropriate at least'2 percent goal.'

My paragraph would go on to say that, 'in particular, the Committee decided to keep the target anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the fed funds and this is important here-'until it has observed substantial improvement in labor market conditions, provided inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to remain at or below the Committee's yesterday.

You're not speaking to you're addressing the world marketplace your presentation, I think this Committee is going to decide despite the at the end or at some point, work in and stress that the solution to the unemployment problem is not completely in the Federal Reserve and monetary policy.  And I would urge you to emphasize the need expansion rather than push Mr. Chairman, you've now heard from three consecutive speakers who are uncomfortable with the Wall Street , that none of the three of us is our words will be listened to. important thing that happens today is what you, Mr. Chairman, to draw on your enormous talents as a a group of economists, and it's important to remember and, most important, the public.

The January and March meetings would provide an with the conference, stress the continuity of policy.  I think this is the wisest course.

The B, in my mind, is QE3, not QE4. round, in my view view both elements of today's decision, the Treasury representing no substantive change in the stance of policy.  I'm viewing the fiscal cliff downside scenario as mostly a opportunity to reassess the economic situation as affected by the fiscal situation and any possible monetary policy responses.  I hope the Committee's communication choices, along Chairman's press note that a recent Financial Times Extra Asset Purchases.' adoption of alternative expect we'll hear in this round some support for delaying the decision on the a smooth transition of characterizing the employment threshold as recent date guidance, and therefore not intended to be a substantial gained in delaying the thresholds decision.  My thinking, I introduction of the thresholds until the March meeting.  I'm ambivalent on this question.  I can see the value of separating the LSAP decision and communication related to the LSAP decision from thresholds communications.  But on reflection, I've decided to support introducing them at this meeting.  Much could change by March, and I think that introducing them now provides the best chance of achieving consistent with the most change of policy.  I don't see a lot to be again, is to emphasize continuity of policy.

confess that my decision to support the LSAP aspect of alternative B at this meeting is angst.  I want to thank the staff for the memo analyzing the various aspects of I not free of continuation of open-ended asset purchases in 2013.  As that memo suggests, I think a reasonable working assumption is that continued asset purchases will have a moderate positive

At that time, the Tealbook forecasts an at years. growth to have stepped up to just above trend in the second growth until July.  My own will be at midyear comes true, I struggle to see how we will make a case for a substantial improvement in the outlook for labor markets.  I think the most year-end.  As a consequence, I have to concede that my support for alternative B expansion along these lines and then something less. effect on real economic activity.  So in that context, it's important to me to decision in my view we are making with program will terminate at midyear.  As stated in the Tealbook mid-2013 there will be accumulating for substantial improvement in the unemployment unemployment rate about where it is right now.  Job growth through midyear is expected to be about the same pace of 150,000 to 160,000 per month that we've seen over the past two Though the Tealbook expects GDP quarter, we would not have even an initial estimate of second-quarter forecast doesn't take particular issue with the Tealbook.  If something like the Tealbook forecast of where the economy convincing realistic timing for making a plausible case for sufficient improvement in labor markets will be closer to implies a balance sheet expansion more like market expectations of $1 trillion than the lower numbers suggested by the Tealbook policy assumption.  In my mind, to be realistic, the decision being made today is closer to $1 trillion-or $1.25 trillion, including the purchases to date since September-and a balance sheet an admirable job of analyzing the various considerations growth.  At the risk of being accused of reductionism, I of this analysis as leading to a practical conclusion that continuing balance sheet of unknowns and that it is appropriate to be cautious.  I'm warm to the Again, the staff has done associated with further balance sheet process all expansion involves a lot notion of tapering the purchases beginning at midyear if the Tealbook and similar forecasts play

December 11-12, 2012

as July will be nearly as difficult as justifying an outright to wrestle further with the question of what LSAP.  In that vein, it seems to me B carries with it some very big communications challenges over the coming going to end up with a smaller expansion of the balance sheet as implied by the to moderate expectations about what is sufficient to arrive at an improved labor market outlook.  A second weeks and months in that we will appear to have backed off the 'substantial out as expected, but justifying reduction in the pace of purchases on the basis of an improved outlook for the labor markets as early end of purchases.  The Committee, therefore, has will be the optics around a decision to make changes in the that alternative months if we're Tealbook policy assumption.  One option is to try constitutes evidence that option is to accept that ending or tapering the pace of asset purchases by midyear will likely have to rely on arguments about efficacy and costs.  That will involve some nimble communications footwork in coming improvement' conditionality and the open-ended approach.

In paragraph 3, I before the words 'at the pace of $45 billion per month' as a paragraph 3.  Instead of the phraseology 'put prefer 'keep' or 'maintain downward paragraph 5, I I endorse the thrust of the sentence, 'The we might avoid any confusion if it reads 'most recent date-based guidance,' more explicit something like, 'The Committee currently views these Let me now just make a couple comments on statement language. support the insertion of 'initially' way to suggest purchases could be adjusted depending on evolving circumstances.  I'd like to make a small suggestion for the last sentence of downward pressure on long-term interest rates,' I pressure' to reinforce the theme of policy continuity.  In the first sentence of support inclusion of the bracketed language.  Also, Committee views these thresholds as consistent with its earlier date-based guidance.'  But I'll just point out that that is, mid-2015, or to be thresholds as consistent with the mid-2015 forward guidance introduced last September.'

the choice of language in brackets at the end of paragraph 5, I prefer the second Regarding option, that is, 'its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent' because this phrase underscores that the thresholds are not a replacement for the Committee's statutory objectives.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

LOCKHART.  I suggest either to say the 'most recent date-based guidance,' so that MR. there is no confusion as to the two previous date-based guidances, or to say, 'The Committee currently views these thresholds as consistent with the mid-2015 forward guidance introduced last September.'

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you.  President Lacker.

I oppose I opposed them in September.  I view them as risk of inflation, exit.

When we launched the program in September growth had averaged 94,000 per month over the previous three months.  Payroll employment is

As I said in now estimated to have per month from September to November, and that gain of 140,000 per month since employment bottomed out in February of September, this looks to me like an economy showing fluctuations around a slow but steady trend, like a balanced growth path.  So I see no reason to expand our asset purchase program now.

For the past two or three years we've been forecasting an acceleration of growth that get less than 2 percent.  We keep revising down our forecasts as they come through. years looks more like impeded growth?  I love Governor Stein's phrase, 'a muddled mix of It has been difficult to identify any single impediment for economic years with Governor Tarullo and with others on labor mismatch.  One could point to a variety of things, but it has been difficult to pin down of small disappointments,' is more evocative or framework, Mr. Chairman, but it factors that are hard to assess, hard to prove, and Governor Stein yesterday painted a vivid picture of what he called a Groundhog Day scenario, in which we find ourselves a expected and the bigger improvement in labor markets, but in about the same situation we're in now, that is, slow growth and slow improvement in labor market doesn't this describe our seeing sluggish economic growth, but we've kept never arrives.

You put on the table the idea that the Committee might, at some point in the future in some circumstances, conclude that our asset purchase program is ineffective or that factors outside our control are limiting back, but clearly that's a will be very helpful though, for the entire Committee's sake, to publicly use language that opens that door, that lays the away from asset purchases.  Particularly important labor market improvements and our capacity to influence them.  I would note though that some strong elements of the language in this statement, as pointed out by President to square with that potential scenario.

I'll also say that I agree with many of the observations made by think there is a significant risk that these are Regarding our forward guidance, I piece about quantitative thresholds at the October made in October was echoed by several people yesterday, by the Vice Chairman today, and by the staff memo on labor market Presidents Bullard and Plosser about thresholds.

And we know that theory indicates that such a path can deliver better of our dual mandate- specifically better outcomes than a completely discretionary policy and better than one that which policy has been constrained by the zero lower bound.

All we have to do is talk about it a little bit more, you in your press conference and that, and I don't think anybody has the desire interest to understand it better.  As many people in this room rates low for a time after the economy has strengthened.

The Vice Chairman raised us with the tightening process if conditions were to improve more rapidly than we anticipate. we have unemployment by 50 basis points in the next six forward then?  The if we have thresholds in place, we have So I think thresholds provide an automatic adjustment to the evolution in the economy where things evolve better than we expect or worse than also going to say a few words about how I think about the inflation safeguard. for inflation, the values we are picking for it, are playing I think the stimulus in the thresholds is really tied part.  It is coming the FRB/US model.  Now, some of us have expressed a concern that the FRB/US model of modeling that have come forward years.  But you can look at the DSGE models that are producing quarterly forecasts and looking at their most recent forecasts, you have to come away as well with the you don't like history.  Over the past 15 years, the SEP and the Greenbook's mediumframe.  And we can turn, instead, to the private-sector Now, I'm I don't really think the threshold choice much of a role in terms of providing stimulus. very much to the unemployment rate.  Why do I say that?  I see the inflation threshold as highly unlikely to be hit.  And this is not just some kind of random thinking on my from doesn't incorporate some of the most up-to-date principles in the past 10 as well, feeling that, boy, that 2ยฝ percent inflation threshold is unlikely to be hit.  If models, you can look at term inflation outlooks never have risen above 2ยผ percent.  This includes periods when resource utilization was considerably higher than it is today, and, in fact, the unemployment rate at times was below 5 percent over that time forecasts.  The Survey of Professional Forecasters, for example, only provided PCE inflation

the CPI inflation outlook that they provide, as If we were to do that, you're going to conclude that the in only three quarters of the past 60. 2.35 percent in that same time frame.  I think it the idea we are going to 2ยฝ percent threshold for inflation is a real tail event.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that in there-we definitely need it.  But we are talking about protecting It is a useful discipline on the Committee to have that kind of useful than the vague discipline that is projections beginning in 2007, but we can look at long as we're willing to adjust it using the usual kinds of estimates of the difference between PCE inflation and CPI inflation. equivalent PCE inflation outlook rose above 2ยผ percent And it never rose above hit a we shouldn't have yourselves against tail events. explicit protection against tail events, much more included in alternative C, for example.

I have indicated in the past two meetings, I am very much in favor of the specificity I am sympathetic to President Plosser's view that we could spell out more about a reaction function than what we are doing am uncomfortable with enemy of the good to that extent. As and the clarity associated with thresholds.  And it would be great if right now in thresholds.  We should continue to work to do that.  But I don't think that we should stick to such an imperfect form of communication as represented by date-based guidance until such time as we have the perfect description of a reaction function.  I letting the perfect be the the unemployment rate, which is the main form of stimulus, to 5ยฝ percent from Yes, we can disagree about the various sources of what has been holding back the whatever those sources of impediments are, they lead us to the same place:  low for more stimulus to deal with those problems.

I think we can safely lowering see that we are providing stimulus through the inflation threshold.  We are So we could lower that and provide the same the unemployment rate threshold and still protect provide better protection with a lower inflation threshold.  But with world where we can just communicate through our 25 basis point moves I have a great deal of comfort that we will be able to communicate hard intrinsically.  If yesterday, to be less precise of the large-scale asset purchase program.  I will suggest to you that the forward on that-as you said in your one-page framework statement yesterday-is to emphasizing the continuing study of efficacy and cost of fed funds rate program.  It is part of the asset conditionality There are challenges to communication; there are always challenges to communication. We have left behind the in the fed funds rate.  We are stuck with the world we are in where we have to communicate about the future, using words as opposed to numerical moves in the fed funds rate.  I personally do not think that thresholds will be hard for us to communicate, Mr. Chairman, because we have you to lead us in that effort. how the thresholds work for the fed funds rate.  I don't see that problem as that was the only thing to communicate, that would be easy.  What is challenging is the idea that we are forced, for the reasons laid out in your one-page framework about the conditionality right way begin to bring forward the rhetoric these programs.  That's not going to be part of the purchase program.  That is, in my mind, what distinguishes why we can't have a

Similarly, the developments in year ago, the median forecast in the Survey of was anticipating an average annual pace of about 710,000 housing starts year.  The pace in October was closer to 900,000, suggesting that activity has also been outperforming expectations over the past year. in labor and housing market conditions have exceeded expectations, accommodation to better-than-expected data strikes me as potentially inconsistent policy.

I think the benefits fall are a few considerations behind my concerns. $1 trillion, which is evidently what is expected by market participants, short of the risks.  There purchase program greater than $500 billion next year could result in a and we are taking capital losses, are also scenarios in which private investors are likely losses.  As I mentioned yesterday, my financial market contacts are The staff's note on the implications of additional security purchases for the exit strategy principles cautions that a portfolio that is difficult to unwind, according to our published exit principles, without impairing market functioning.

So it is important to me that we put more emphasis on financial stability.  The staff is a improve.  But that got us into the most-recent facing in the future.

I would be more comfortable with an asset purchase program of a total of $750 billion in security purchases. Based on these concerns, the size that is assumed in the Tealbook-that is, For a program of this size, I think that it would be more appropriate to start with a pace of

When we had this conversation about forward guidance, I mentioned I do have some concerns about using a forecast for inflation.  I continue to think a 7 percent I have an estimate 6ยฝ percent carries too much inflation risk for me.  That said, I am again, if you use your press conference to explain the motivation behind the change qualifications, including an explanation of what additional measures at for the labor market conditions as well as the kinds of measures that we I'm sounding like a broken record at this meeting-are the same concerns I have around the larger LSAP program, and that is that we should not only be focused on Finally, I remain open to adjusting the language of the forward guidance to be data-driven.

I am also willing, Mr. Chairman, to support the threshold language, and to make the necessary we will be looking will be looking at in projecting inflation.  Again, my biggest concerns with the threshold language-and I know that

good way to accomplish that.  Vice Chairman Dudley summed up the arguments and MBS purchases.  I would also mention that I agree with him that I would strike the a substantial improvement' phrase from paragraph 5.  In terms of LSAPs, I Lockhart's remarks.  My own view is that appropriate policy will include year, probably ending them in the fourth own expectation.  And I would like to respond to President Fisher's Francisco Fed.  It is true there are issues about how about how much of MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  The economic situation calls for additional, ongoing monetary stimulus, and continuing our Treasury and MBS purchases is a for a combined strategy very well, and I agree with his comments in terms of using both Treasury bracketed 'it sees will echo President extending these purchases well through most of this quarter.  That is just my remarks about the research done at the San do the Treasury purchases affect financial conditions.  They have identified those-both a signaling channel and a term-premium channel.  There is a lot of uncertainty a role each channel plays.  Of course, both are beneficial to the economy.  But, again, going back to the Vice Chairman's comments, there is a lot of uncertainty about these tools in general, so that argues for using both of them.  That's my own conclusion from reading that research.

I confess to seeing this as a a way to link our policy to economic outcomes in a way that conveys that we are and risks of both I do support the thresholds language in paragraph 5, but closer call than the decision to extend our asset purchases.  On the positive side, thresholds are simple and clear staying low for longer.  Nonetheless, quantitative thresholds present challenges

December 11-12, 2012

pay attention to.  When for liftoff, the spotlight was cast on the calendar, and that's what focused on, for better or for worse.  Once we start talking in terms of an unemployment course, it is important that we communicate the various modifiers will be following the spotlight.  Second, we don't have a a 6ยฝ percent threshold.  For example, as I mentioned at our previous liftoff.  Now, this is not just a theoretical concern.  A year or so ago a a major intellectual shift in how we think about and compared with, say, a standard linear reaction function.  Even if we just and inflation, our usual reaction function is a function of both spotlight on either further ahead-I am still looking to the time rates do rise above zero, our use of thresholds will substance and communications.  First of all, we should recognize we are shining a very bright spotlight on the unemployment rate.  I find the theory of rational inattention developed by Chris Sims and others instructive in this regard.  It reminds us that people have limited capacity to absorb information, and are, therefore, selective in what information they we stated a specific date everyone threshold, it will be the unemployment rate that takes center stage, commanding all of the attention of our audience.  Of and exemptions and footnotes around the use of thresholds.  But in the end, we should be realistic and recognize that most eyes solid foundation on which to base our specific numerical choice for the unemployment threshold. That came out in some of the comments already.  Over time, with new information and analysis, we may regret choosing meeting, movements in  * or the natural rate of unemployment could change the appropriate r conditions for funds rate 7 or 7ยฝ percent unemployment threshold seemed eminently reasonable.  In the future, we may well find ourselves in the awkward position of having to change the announced threshold either up or down.  Third, thresholds represent communicate policy focus on unemployment unemployment and inflation together.  We don't normally shine the policy unemployment or inflation separately.  Looking when interest rates are above zero-once

communications challenges specific to this approach can be addressed Mr. Chairman-we're loading everything on the press conference. Weighing these costs and benefits-and, important, in the current situation where the funds rate is stuck at zero and our other policy options are limited-I am comfortable supporting thresholds.

Over for us to vary the pace of our purchases as evidence pertaining to the progress of the labor market accumulates.  Inclusion of the word 'initially' in paragraph 3, coupled with omission in that same paragraph of any total for the quantity of purchases, signals that the pace of these purchases will be subject to review.  And as review the the Chairman too, am particularly concerned about the possible threaten financial stability.

We also face the serious risk that inflation, which we currently forecast to run below our target, could decline further over time, raising real interest rates and thereby making it stimulus.  Under such circumstances, there is an important benefit from intend to take the punch bowl away just as the party is time of our September meeting that our open-ended purchase program would be interpreted by markets as tepid support purchases to significant improvements in the outlook for the labor market, and coupling this

But how aggressive expectations have become unmoored.

In case anyone thinks this Bloomberg articles this week, reporting the results of its assumes that the market includes the effects of market disappointment.  But how much runway do we really have to modify market expectations; how do we understanding rather than sharp disappointment? learning will go in the other direction-that is, we will be the ones doing the learning, as market expectations get ever more firmly engrained, and we ought not to disappoint.  Even worse, markets could revise upward their it will take longer than they because they come to believe that the stopping thought.  In either case, the upward revision would widen the wouldn't happen, I would point out that the memo on market functioning in the MBS market indicates that some market participants already expect MBS purchases to continue through the first quarter of 2014.

It does contain a In preparation for this meeting, I went back to the policies that was distributed in preparation for our meeting in September.  The memo emphasized that the effectiveness of a flow-based program depends heavily on the public's understanding of the Committee's reaction function and the stopping cites the stopping condition as the key feature necessary to make the policy responsive to evolving economic conditions.  The memo further some minimum time frame for purchases to continue in order to avoid having the public underestimate the discussion of risks related to market functioning or inflation expectations coming unanchored as

Finally, the and costs are difficult to judge, and warns that such experience with such policies upon which to draw, I think the authors flowformulation, it is important to why the discrepancy between market expectations and developed. the balance sheet might establish an upper memo goes on to acknowledge that efficacy an escape clause could damp the response of asset prices to the policy announcement.

But now that we do have some experience with our examine that experience for clues about expected policy has wish that I had thought more about the possibility that markets would I guess I expected markets to view commitment only through the end of the year, and I relied heavily on the costs But we are where we are, and the especially about the limits to balance sheet size and, by implication, purchases-for it yesterday that the accounting losses didn't as there was an overall economic benefit.  That analysis is less comforting that are harder to think most of the world thinks as I do in more of an accounting sense. For myself, I think I put too much emphasis on the potential for markets to underestimate our intentions.  I now focus so heavily on the economic conditions that would lead to stopping and pay so little attention to the costs and efficacy conditions.  In retrospect, our statement as a and efficacy off-ramps as potentially limiting purchases. question is, what do we do now?  I thought the memos provided for this meeting were helpful for thinking is the risk imposed by a very large balance sheet that is driving my reservations about continued asset purchases.  Mr. Chairman, you made the case really matter as long to me for two reasons.  First, it assumes economic benefits from the policy measure.  And, second, I

Unless the public and the Congress have been prepped to understand and accept the losses as an expected condition, losses pose a risk to the reputation and independence of the understating their losses, despite their adherence to GAAP.  As unrealized losses grow, I can envision our accounting treatment strengthening the call to audit the Fed.  I ways in which it might constrain policy.  President Bullard mentioned yesterday one possible way that this could happen.  We could lose the authority to pay interest on reserves, and that would certainly complicate our exit strategy.  I think we need to think long whether a policy that takes on so much interest rate risk that it is highly likely to lead to both operating and capital losses in future expected by markets, modeled as options 3, 4, as I said earlier, if market perceptions of the outlook for labor market I do recognize that creating confusion in the result in a diminishment Asset purchases in the amounts currently and 5, represent for me an absolute upper bound to our balance sheet size.  And I don't think the risks inherent in the $750 billion in purchases, including in the Tealbook, modeled as options 1 and 2, should be dismissed as inconsequential.  So I see roughly $500 billion in bad news to deliver to markets.  And conditions or the stopping conditions lead to expectations of even more purchases, the bad news gap could get even bigger.  At the same time, markets at this time, when fiscal uncertainty is so high, would probably

December 11-12, 2012

wait to correct market perceptions, communications will need to be.  And it seems to me, if the market of the positive results we have seen so far.  But the longer we the more forceful those continues to discount any stopping condition other than economic conditions, the ultimate disappointment when other restraints on policy become clear could be damaging to our credibility with respect to the commitment implied by the threshold language proposed for this meeting.

I suppose it is possible that conditions will improve and we can declare that we had when we made the September decision signal to markets would conditions, roughly 150,000 new jobs a month, and three- or four-tenths on themselves satisfy our stopping rule.  Our own forecast assumed weak up to June before we even project I can't envision an outcome that meets the labor market condition in time for a a reason for stopping, these purchases are not working, but all of a likely reason to stop I have looked hard at the and I just don't see anything that rises to the level of a substantial improvement in the outlook for labor market victory, but we are starting this new program of Treasury purchases in the face of substantial upward revisions to the employment numbers and a decline in the unemployment rate of four-tenths since then.  So the likely be that those unemployment did not by growth this quarter and next, which takes us right improvement. mid-2013 exit.  I have also tried to think of a way to articulate efficacy as and I just can't see how it is helpful to policy to say those in the past did and any that might be undertaken in the future would work.  Nor do I see anything on the near horizon to suggest that market functioning would be purchasing at mid-2013.

we will learn between now and then or because we reach a limit that we For me the question then becomes, whether we are likely to stop purchases in mid-2013 because of something

December 11-12, 2012

I came to the realization that the reason I am already convinced that midyear is my concern over the total size of a larger or smaller balance sheet than the one that I assume that everyone sees some upper limit.  The closer we get to these know now-which is how we will need to stop or begin tapering purchases by the balance sheet.  And as many conversations as we have had in this room about transparency, I don't see any indication in alternative B that there are any upper limits to balance sheet size. Others on this Committee may see the limits as gives me pause, but boundaries, the more important it seems for the market to know where the boundaries might be.

about balance sheet size is in the minutes, the minutes simply stated that 11 participants policy would include significant additional asset purchases.  I would could simply reference balance sheet or program size.  And lest of purchases be comforted by the numbers of people there, I am actually expected more purchases because I expect that the best we will be able to by midyear.  At any rate, now that asset purchases are open-ended, I and actually submit and publish projections of balance sheet size at our that we do with the fed funds target. Perhaps the place to start communicating SEP, or both.  The SEP template asks for differences between individual projections of the appropriate path of the balance sheet and the path assumed in the Tealbook.  The responses to this question that were reported in the September thought that appropriate expect the discussion in the minutes of this meeting would contain some reference to participants' expectations for total purchases.  This discussion doesn't necessarily have to reveal the Tealbook assumption; it anyone on the high side one of the ones who accomplish is a tapering think we must go further next SEP, in the same way

Mr. Chairman, you and I have discussed this, and I communicate about costs and benefits, but belief that we have some way to reassure markets my preference is not to introduce thresholds at this time, my primary concern with the policy statement is still the continued disparity between market expectations.

with the hope that, first, we will work to is So I plan to support alternative B at this meeting understand how the members of this Committee view future purchases, especially with respect to the assumed stopping conditions, measures of cost and efficacy, and maximum balance sheet size; and, second, that we communicate clearly to eliminate the gap between market expectations and our Committee intentions.  And like President Pianalto, I believe that the reflection in the minutes of both the comments made here today and the balance sheet assumptions in the SEP

I I would not include the a first step in that direction. would support the 'maintain' rather than 'put downward pressure.' bracketed language at the beginning of paragraph 5.

That leaves us, or at least me, in I am sure about is that labor yet.  Given that belief, I wouldn't want us to do anything that would remove any of the heft that we got in September.  I think dialing down the and almost would be perceived as some removal of accommodation, but markets wouldn't quite Betsy alluded to, I am not as sanguine about the communication challenge of my fellow supporters of alternative B are.  I think Betsy has rehearsed the won't repeat it.  That is also why I, like Betsy, thought you might want to given that this thing may MR. TARULLO.  Thank for me, not a close said.  From my point of view, the situation that we confront is the one that Janet alluded to earlier, which is we agreed on a program in September not be perceived with quite the heft that it was by something of a dilemma.  On the one hand, given my quite strong view that more accommodation is appropriate at this time, one of the few things markets are not anywhere near healthy now Treasury purchases would be a signal that would at best be uncertain and unclear surely understand why and what had changed.  On the other hand, for many of the reasons that and Dennis have already here as some problems well, and so I pair the thresholds language with the first time that a signal was being

But as are and would say that with respect to the issues around the LSAPs, there are two sets of distinct greater or lesser relevance to people depending on their substantive positions. I listen today, there are a number of people September-and so that is a pretty clear answer.  Although no one has expect that they will be expectations is not as imminent a problem. group of people in the middle-I suspect Elizabeth is one of them-who are certain how long they may be comfortable because they do want to see what kind will get a better idea of the efficacy question way.  To the degree that that group of people actually becomes an important fulcrum of well find himself in for the I issues that are of One is the actual question about the purchases.  As who would be perfectly comfortable stopping them right now-would prefer that we had not even undertaken them in said so in an unqualified way, I suspect that some of us around the table comfortable for some time to come continuing purchases.  So, from their point of view, the communication challenge of trying to ramp back And then, there is a genuinely not of impact is being had and may sense that they along the future decisionmaking-no inside information here, but the Chairman may that middle position at some point along the way-we do want to preserve optionality Committee as a whole.

How can we achieve that I And so the question, just to restate it is, how does way as to affect that investors will gradually realize that cumulative purchases will be about $500 billion.  Well, how exactly is that without giving negative signals quickly, which would thereby undermine some of that heft that indicated earlier?  My personal sense is today is not the day to begin giving negative signals

December 11-12, 2012

clearer statement of criteria in a somewhat abstract, But this is a challenge beginning, with the March press conference, and maybe even the February monetary policy challenge for all of us individually and collectively because, boy, this one has LSAPs greater or lesser compulsion to state them.  I put that on the table as a difficulty, figuring out how to thread that needle over the course of course, on people's substantive views as well as a because it would undermine the heft.  A disembodied way is probably the best that can be done. probably testimony, and a 'Babel' written all over it with everybody coming out and giving their views of what mean and what improvement in a labor market is and where the costs or where the benefits are. That has not proved helpful for the institution in the past.  However, people do have different views and feel which I think is a shared difficulty, of the next few months.  It is dependent, of communications challenge.

I have come around, as I have said earlier.  The fact that I have come I think there are some shortcomings or costs as well as benefits, and already mentioned them today.  If I had my druthers, I would get rid of all of the I am not going to win that I would say is, Charlie Plosser, on this I actually think the potentially incomplete information given by the unemployment rate I understand to be your policy inclinations, comes down more quickly because of In this context at least, I don't think those kinds of problems that Sarah are of particular concern, but that's not to dismiss all of the that On thresholds, around reveals the fact that people have other verbiage besides the thresholds themselves in paragraph 5.

The only specific thing one, works in your favor on thresholds, given what because to the degree that the unemployment rate transitory labor market participation developments, that would get us to the point of thinking about tightening sooner. and I and others have talked about communications concerns around thresholds.

The expectation for additional appeared to be actual improvements in the indicators of consumer spending at the meeting have turned out to be fleeting.  Real disposable income is rising less than we expected, and I think it will be some time before we see considerable momentum in labor compensation sufficient to drive consumption or help create a virtuous cycle of economic growth.  At the same time, inflation appears to be well contained. there don't appear to be any such broad-based pressures developing at this primary risks to the outlook are still large and to the downside.

It is continue to convey this commitment, especially in the and the current economic environment.  An important step for to reflect the balance of this commitment to the efficacy, financial stability, and market communication of this balance in a way that doesn't destroy the beneficial our accommodative policies, and in a way that doesn't make us look like will be a layering of a communication strategy that we are only now beginning to contemplate. Looking at the statement as a whole, I think its thrust and tone is to be clarifying for economic agents our commitment to better outcomes.  With this overall thrust and tone, the lower tail of possibilities that households and businesses might worry about gets partially For instance, the odds that this Committee begins news, and prematurely slows the economy, should remain small. Committee will greet worsening should seem less likely to economic participants.  We want to make sure that households and businesses understand that the Committee remains committed to the promotion of future economic recovery rather than perceive an important that our statement as a whole current context of the fiscal cliff future statements, I should say, will be promotion of an economic recovery with concerns about operation.  The expectational aspects of Governor Yellen's characterization of communications by the Bank of Japan, will require careful work.  Adding to this communication challenge regarding remittances continue to believe that there are good arguments to be made for being even more formulation of alternative B that includes the had plenty of deliberation and consideration of these values.  We have discussed that are thresholds rather than triggers, and we have constructed a qualitative set of additional I explicit with our forward guidance.

Obviously, though, I sense that the formulation will be viewed as triggers rather than thresholds and will lead to inadvertent tightening.

Calendar dates give absolutely no information, and the statement's proposed language is better than that. least marginally clarifying.  What and the public believe that we have a lower inflation threshold than we do, then when inflation moves above the level there might be some concern that we have lost our resolve or our keep inflation in check, and that could raise inflationary expectations.

do so with Pianalto and going at their $40 billion clip but began to dial back the Treasury purchases, and in so doing sent a message to markets that reined in expectations about the ultimate scale of the program. MR. STEIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B, though I fairly serious reservations, similar to some of those expressed by President Governor Duke.  I would have preferred an option that kept the MBS purchases current clearer As a number of people have mentioned, based on the current dealer survey, these expectations

December 11-12, 2012

I understand the point that many people have would have likely disappointed the market, given your you can't disappoint the market, you run the risk of yourself boxed in.  Ultimately, the analysis has to fall back to the fundamental costs and are considerably larger, at least than I would be comfortable with, for virtually any evolution of the labor market outlook.  Now, of course emphasized, that if we dial back in this way we where these expectations currently are.  But of course this is a dynamic problem, and if constraint at each point on the path is that getting benefits of the different policy options.

I my admittedly gut sense is that the the MBS are more in the form of signaling and in some sense you are talking about signaling, it is incumbent to of the appeals, to me was that this was an alternative way to convey our generally dovish have noted, was more credible in some ways than a calendar date.  I Treasury of a missed opportunity. On the benefit side, I do believe the MBS purchases have been beneficial, which is why would favor continuing them.  As for the Treasury purchases, incremental benefits laid on top of a complement to our forward guidance.  But if ask about alternative messaging technologies.  And I had thought that one at least, of the thresholds intentions, and, as others thought it would have been nice to use it as a more cost-effective substitute for purchases in the signaling department.  But we are not doing that kind of substituting today, which strikes me as a bit found the algebraic formulation you laid out yesterday extremely helpful.  It has all the right ingredients and clarifies things the real missing ingredients in the debate we is a placeholder; it could embody many things.  And what would be extremely helpful is clearer shared understanding of what is driving it and what is driving the convexity in On the cost side, let me start by saying, Mr. Chairman, I that very well.  And in so doing, it underscores one of have had so far, which is that we have not forced ourselves to a consensus on C x ( ). C x ( ) essentially if we had a

December 11-12, 2012

where do the increasing marginal costs come from?  In an ideal world, we would almost a quantitative theory and that we could operationalize a little bit tradeoffs.  But for all of the formal modeling work that we do in the everything that we have in the models is really very linear in nature. At this point, any analytical discipline around the question of how much is too much, and we are facing at this point. C x ( )-that is, have something that was to help us think about the FRB/US and elsewhere, There is no explicit mechanism that drives diminishing returns or increasing costs. we really don't have that is essentially the question thought Imagine everything is exactly as it is today.  The economy is exactly the same; we there are no signs of market dysfunction on the as it was reported to us yesterday.  The only am going to pick a number, which is I know it's not a real number.  Let's stipulate there are not going to be any exit everything else the My overriding intuition is the answer yes.  Now, if you could figure out why, maybe you could start backing into a theory a $5 trillion portfolio with 10-year duration, we would have effectively government is financing itself why I picked these numbersaverage duration of Treasury debt in the hands of the public is 4.4 years, and there $50 trillion, which is about In an effort to try and think a little bit about this question, let me propose a experiment. know whatever it is we know about efficacy; horizon; the financial stability picture is exactly difference is that the SOMA portfolio is at-and I unrealistic but makes my math easy to do in real time-$5 trillion at a 10-year duration.  Let's just imagine that; problems.  So the question is, if we had a $5 trillion SOMA portfolio, with same, would anybody in this room change their vote? should be that would give us a little bit of content and guidance now.  My best stab at a theory is based on fiscal risk.  So if we had made it so that on a consolidated basis, the United States completely on an overnight basis.  To see why-and you will see right now, the is about $11 trillion of such debt.  So 4.4 times 11 is approximately

December 11-12, 2012

times 10see why I picked the numbers-if we owned $5 trillion of 10-year duration equivalence, it duration.  This is a different way of framing it:  It would be, from an Fed owned only bills get our fiscal act together, I would hope that that would strike you as a $5 trillion of 10-year duration equivalence.  That's the short side of the trade.  Five you would exactly net out.  On this particular way of thinking about it, we would have completely offset the Treasury's interest rate risk exposure perspective, exactly like a world in which the and in which the United States government was financing itself, rolling on an overnight basis.  In a world where we can't slightly sobering proposition.

I can do in terms of putting concrete magnitudes to this thing.  In doing as, or potentially more, as President Pianalto and others have suggested, financial stability can't quantify them in the same risk that I have been kind of looking under the street lamp with this analysis. far as these fiscal costs and risks go, I completely concede that reasonable people can and are relative to the benefits.  And Mr. Chairman, yesterday am not completely there yet in my own mind.  The framing seems to matter.  When I I concede that I completely strong counterargument. That is the best so, I don't mean to suggest that there are no other issues that are important-in particular, issues.  I don't mean to downplay them.  Of course, because I way, there is some As should disagree about how big they you suggested that some of these risks were not that large relative to the benefits.  That may be right.

The function, fiscal capital gains and losses, exit, and I would say there's another implicit category in the variable, which is It seems to me that none of these costs can be estimated in the time frame in which we will be years down the road.  For about deferred assets, or five years of low five years.  These are all different faces of the same fact pattern. effects of losses like that until the events actually occur several years down the First, the costs.  When we significantly purchases incur additional costs.  There are vast uncertainties around that including the form or channel through which the costs appear, their Chairman's list of costs include market financial stability, and g 'other'-costs from unforeseen sources. particularly well understood or accurately continuing our purchases.  Each of them is likely to be realized only example, we have modeled a present value loss, as Governor Stein indicated crudely, of $100 billion from option 3 or $7 billion a year, or remittances beginning in can't know the

Now, we'd have to explain to the market why we're not selling any securities, having explicitly purchased them on the understanding that we would sell them as quickly unknown, and our level of comfort around exit is a bit overdone.

Lower Treasury rates will effect, I would predict, on private business rates, which are already case, private-business borrowers have not responded repurchasing their own equity or refinancing economic effects of that will be small.  There may also be going to pick up some effect of our purchases, and I'm always going to think that the vast It's mostly risk-off these days.

The second-order some pass-through to consumer borrowing rates.  We're already addressing that through the most important one of those, through our MBS purchases.  With global economic weakness and the ongoing fiscal crisis in the United States, the dollar should remain strong.  Our short-term event studies are those effects will decay quickly under the power of much greater forces, particularly risk-on, risk-off flow. increase consumer or business confidence, and as are concerned, the expected while we have, along with other forces, managed to drive down real 10-year returns by more than 200 basis points.  The stock market is pricing in a really high risk premium, and our purchases seem only to widen it.  So I would also tend to lower my marginal benefit curve below that proposed in the staff me:  I'm concerned that the actions contemplated in this are setting us on a path to a much larger balance sheet with likely benefits that are not It will be very difficult to get off that path unless markets starting with this meeting.  If our actions at this meeting validate Here's where that leaves meeting commensurate to the risks that we're bearing. we begin to prepare the the markets' expectations of $1.2 trillion in purchases, the costs of correcting that impression

I'm not supportive of a program of am concerned that we may be sitting on bad news in the form of a disconnection the expectations of 12 of the 19 participants and those of the market.  It may be that will go up, and our that size, and I between publication of our balance sheet expectations would close that gap, and I'd like to see us explore moving in that direction for the March SEP.

as thresholds are concerned, I had thought, as Governor Tarullo mentioned, that it at a future meeting.  However, I can see that that doesn't will support thresholds at this meeting.  I'm going to vote to support B despite my misgivings, and in doing so I'm voting, just to be clear, for option 1 and oriented toward MBS, goes longer without increasing the total amount. As far might make sense to hold off in announcing thresholds and use them in effect to cover a reduction in our Treasury purchases seem to carry the day, and I alternative not for option 3, and I would actually prefer a program that is much more even one that

I certainly recognize the very difficult nature of the decision.  I believe Governor Yellen who said, though, there is no easy choice here.  On the one hand, there with further balance sheet action, and the a new communication step, which is not clear precedent.  But on Irrespective of market expectations, I think through on that commitment and to continue the accommodation that Almost everybody reflected that this is very difficult-not free of angst, I think was the expression that was used. it was are real and difficult-to-measure costs associated thresholds, for that matter, are the other hand, we are taking significant risks with an economy that is obviously underperforming, and we are missing on both sides of our mandate.  Again, there is no easy decision.  We did make a commitment in September. it is reasonable to follow we discussed in September.

But I thought it would help maybe if I gave you a I plan you a little bit.  'The pattern of future asset will depend on the Committee's evaluation of incoming information, in two respects.

On the asset purchases, let me just read purchases First, we expect to continue asset purchases until we see a substantial improvement in the

The Federal asset purchases over the past few years have provided important support to the example, by helping to keep mortgage rates historically low.  The Committee updating those assessments.

'Second, the Committee will be monitoring economic and financial developments to assess both the efficacy Reserve's economy, for expects this policy tool to continue to be effective and the costs and risks to remain manageable, but as the program continues, we will be regularly evidence suggests that the program's effects or risks become apparent as the balance sheet appropriate.

With respect to the thresholds, let me just say that it has been while this is not perfect, it is a step in the right direction.  Our going forward.  But let me give you a flavor of how I With respect to that, what and the costs and efficacy more than a year since we introduced the date-based guidance.  We have had substantial discussion.  I think that communication will continue to evolve will explain this to the media in a couple of hours:  'Although the modified forward guidance

as likely to of those thresholds, reduction in policy accommodation.  For 6ยฝ percent at a time when inflation an immediate increase in its target for the federal funds rate to be inappropriate. policy accommodation, the Committee approach in seeking to mitigate the deviations of inflation from its thresholds, not triggers. 'First, as the statement notes, the Committee views its current low-rate policy be appropriate at least until the specified thresholds are met.  Reaching one however, will not automatically trigger immediate example, if unemployment were to decline to slightly below and inflation expectations were subdued and were projected to remain so, the Committee might judge Ultimately, in deciding when and how quickly to reduce will follow a balanced longer-run 2 percent goal and deviations of employment from its estimated maximum level.'  So the first point is that these are given decline in the unemployment rate, the Committee will take into account the and falling labor force The Committee will also consider whether the improvement in the unemployment So it is not a mechanical reaction function. Second point:  'Second, the Committee recognizes that no single indicator provides a complete assessment of the state of the labor market and therefore will consider changes in the unemployment rate within the broader context of the labor market conditions.  For example, in evaluating a extent to which that decline was associated with increases in employment and hours worked, as opposed to, say, increases in the number of discouraged workers participation. rate appears sustainable.'

In making its collective judgment about the inflation trend, the Committee will consider a variety of indicators, including measures mean, and core inflation; the views of outside forecasters; and the predictions of econometric statistical models of inflation. inflation expectations to ensure that those expectations remain well anchored.'

This available for purchases, the Desk will maintain the existing limit of equivalent to the net duration of the MEP, as purchases averaged about 1ยฝ years' duration.  Of point and At this Treasury proceeds at sales of short-dated Treasury securities, the SOMA portfolio years.  Specifically, the just $21 million in 2013 and $475 adjustment, the Desk will not reinvest proceeds Treasury securities of less than $2 million for operational efficiency and asked questions.  Thank you. The Desk plans to distribute the $45 billion in monthly Treasury purchases across seven sectors based on the approximate weight shown in the table in the Desk statement.  This distribution differs somewhat from that used in the maturity extension program.  The remaining maturity wider distribution of eligible securities increases the amount of supply purchase.  In conducting buying only up to 70 percent of outstanding issuance per security.  The average duration of monthly purchases under this wider distribution will be roughly nine years.  This is nearly averaged about 10ยฝ years' duration and sales course, the proposed distribution could be altered if market conditions warrant, but we would aim to keep the average duration at roughly the same nine-year consult with the Committee regarding any material deviation from this plan. point, the Desk anticipates conducting 18 purchase operations per month with the size of those operations ranging from just under $1 billion to over $5 billion, depending on the sector.  A schedule of the purchase operations to be conducted over the following month will be released on the last business day of the month.  As directed, the Desk will also resume the process of reinvesting maturing auction.
