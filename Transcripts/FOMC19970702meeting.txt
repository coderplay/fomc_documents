Questions or eter? f P

MR. BOEHNE. In  the emo  that  resents  ome of he  options  or ealing  ith m p s t f d w declining  equired  perating  alances  t  the eserve  Banks,  you and  Don Kohn addressed  he r o b a R t topic f eturning   lagged eserve  equirements  rom  the  current  ontemporaneous eserve o r to r r f c r requirements  egime.  There  was a  reference  n hat  ocument  to  the reparation  nother r i t d p ofa memorandum.

Could  you elaborate  n  that  n erms f hether hat  aper ill  e  a  discussion morandum o i t o w t p w b me or a  decision-oriented orandum.  Where are  you on  that  ssue? mem i

MR. FISHER.  I  would  be  happy  to  refer  o on and  his taff   that. t D s on

MR. KOHN. Board  staff  orking  on  a  memorandum isw for oard  consideration  at B th proposes  a  return  o agged eserve  ccounting.  he Board  has  not  seen  any  of his  r  heard his t l r a T t o t discussed  reviously cause e are  still  rking  on  this  ssue  t  the taff vel.    think  here re p be w wo i a s le I t a two  factors  hat ake this    potentially  portune ime  to  consider  his  ssue. ne is hat  s t m a op t t i O t a reserve  alances  ave  dropped,  e have  had  increasing fficulties  dicting quired  eserve b h w di pre re r balances rom  week to  week. The reason s hat  ault  ash  has  been  high nough  to nable ome f i t v c e e s banks  to hift  ack  and  forth  etween  being ound  by  reserve  equirements d  not. he previous s b b b r an T formulas hat  ere  used  to  predict ich  banks  were  going  to e  bound  and  which  were  not o t w wh b n longer  ork. We  have  tried  o  improve  these redictions,   I  think  e have.  The errors  ave w t p and w h dropped  substantially,   t  s till  re difficult   ake predictions out emands for eserve buti i s mo tom ab d r balances n  an  environment n  which  we cannot ven  be  certain at  ne  or  another  ajor  large i i e th o m bank  will e  bound  by  reserve  equirements. econdly, he ederal  eserve  System  is n  the b r S t F R i process f  changing he rogramming and  accounting  egime  for eserve  equirements, d  it o t p r r r an would  be  relatively  sy o  allow  for   shift ck  to  lagged eserve  ccounting  nce  that ea t a ba r a o programming is ompleted. reviously,  were told  hat  t  ould  be  a  major  undertaking  o  go c P we t i w t into he eserve ccounting  ystem  and  change  it  rom  contemporaneous o agged ccounting. t r a s f t l a The implementation  f he  new accounting  ystem, hich  I  think ill ccur bout   year rom o t s w w o a a f

now,  would  be  an  opportune oment  to hift  ack  to  lagged eserves.  s I  mentioned,  e are m s b r A w going  to ome to  the oard  with   proposal  n  that. c B a o

MR.  BOEHNE. As you  know, this  s n  issue  hat  as  been  debated t ength  t i a t h a l a various  imes.  We  have  had  both egimes. e had  contemporaneous eserves  efore he  late t r W r b t 1960s, hen we went  to  lagged eserve  equirements.  s we got  into he  monetary  aggregates w r r A t approach  to  policy,  shifted ck  to  contemporaneous eserves.    think  his  s ore than  a we ba r I t i m technical sue. t as  implications r ow monetary  policy  s mplemented  or  the erception  f is I h fo h i i p o how it  s  implemented.   hope  that  his  ill  ot e  treated  s ust    technical sue.  t ught o e i I t w n b a j a is I o t b talked  bout  in he roader ontext  f onetary  policy  ather  han  in  terms f ccounting a t b c o m r t o a changes.  It s   worthwhile ebate o ave, nd  we ought  to ave  it  n  that  roader ontext. i a d t h a h i b c

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. When  we get  there,  hy don't  e bring t  o  the w w i t Committee  as  a  subject  or eneral  iscussion,  esuming  that omething aterializes  t f f g d pr s m ou o what  the taff   working  on  at he oment? s is t m

MR. BROADDUS. I  agree ery  much with hat  Ed Boehne  just  aid. t ould  seem v w s I w to  be  especially propriate   discuss  hat  n   situation  ere  it  s ossible  hat  2  may be ap to t i a wh i p t M coming back  on  track.  Lagged  reserve  ccounting  recludes  he se  of ny  sort  f eserve a p t u a o r operating  nstrument  n  my opinion,  nd  such  an  instrument  ight  be  a  more desirable tion  n i i a m op i this  ind  of ituation. k s

MR.  FISHER.  I  would  underscore  hat  he aper,  articularly   decision  ree hat t t p p the t t shows  the  different  tions,  ot ntended  o e  technical   to ury  this  ssue  n  the etails. op isn i t b or b i i d Don and  I  were  trying  o ay his  ut  so  you  would  see  all  he teps  e think  eed  to e  gone t l t o t s w n b through efore ou  reach ny  of hat  we deem to  be the mportant  olicy  hoices  t  the ottom b y a w i p c a b

of  the ecision  ree,  s  it  ere, nd  perhaps long he ay. I  hope  no  one  looks t his  aper  as d t a w a a t w a t p taking  ny  of hese ssues  nd  burying hem.  Rather,  e are  trying  o  let  ou  see,  ith  as  much a t i a t w t y w advance  notice  s  we can  give,  he  full  cope  of he ossible  hanges hat  ight  be  envisaged  s a t s t p c t m a a  potential swer  to he  low operating  alances  roblem. an t b p

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I  think resident oaddus  is aising  interesting P Br r an issue. f  he 2  data ventually ggest hat  here ay be  some particular  licy  se  for 2, the I t M e su t t m po u M whole  concept f eserves  n  the tructure  onetary  operations,  pecially    the  context  f he o r i s ofm es in o t significant  cline  n equired  eserves, ll ecome more than  a  technical estion.    think  e de i r r wi b qu I w will ave  to  be  very areful  bout ow that  lays ut. e  do  not ant  to  start ving in ne h c a h p o W w mo o direction d  find hat  e have  to  backtrack  ecause  of actors  did ot  foresee. y  guess  is an t w b f we n M that  t  ould be  very  premature o onsider  he ssue  t his  tage,  ut  I  would  not  rule  ut  the i w t c t i a t s b o possibility t  t ay become a  significant  estion  n  6  months,  18 months;   do  not now ha i m qu i I k precisely en. wh

MR.  KOHN. As you  and  President  roaddus  remember,  the eserve  equirements  re B r r a geared o  Ml,  and  there  re o  reserve  equirements  n  non-M1  deposit  alances. t a n r o b

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I  think hat  s recisely e ssue  n  the ense hat  f  e t i p th i i s t i w go  back  to 2  and  stay ith eserves  n  transaction  lances, mething  is ncoherent.  t  the M w r o ba so i A moment,  it  oesn't  atter ll  hat  uch. But  it  ould  if  e began  to  take he 2  cone  seriously. d m a t m w w t M Any other  uestions? q

MR.  MELZER. I  have  one.  I  gree ith he eneral  hrust  f he iews  that  ave  just a w t g t o t v h been  expressed.  ne of he ptions  n  the  decision  ree  ould  be  to  lower eserve  equirements O t o o t w r r and  increase  he eposit  ase  to hich  they pply.  It ould  be  exactly  n  that  ircumstance  hat t d b w a w i c t I

think he  point  he hairman  is aking  would  be  relevant.    just  ant  to  make the  general t t C m I w comment that    am glad he  staff s  undertaken his  nalysis  f he mplications  d  possible I t ha t a o t i an responses  o he  decline  n  operating  alances.    am sure hat  veryone  shares his  iew.  We t t i b I t e t v have  to e  concerned bout xcessive  olatility he  federal  unds  rate, t  I  think  ome b a e v in  t f bu s volatility ctually ite  esirable  rom  a  market  discipline  int f iew,  particularly is  a qu d f po o v as required  eserves  ecome a  less mportant  river  f he  demand for ederal  unds.  We really r b i d o t f f want  institutions  ave  the ncentive   hold  appropriate lances  o ettle ansactions,   the to  h i to ba t s tr and price  hey  would  pay  in   very  stable  unds arket ight  not  be  sufficient    create  he ind  of t a f m m to t k incentives at  e would  like  o  see  in  that  rocess.    know that,   market  people,  his  s th w t p I as t i something  you  are  well ware  of,  nd  we should eep  it  n ind  as  we think bout hese ssues. a a k i m a t i

MR. PARRY. With  regard o  the able  n he  middle  of hart   showing  output  aps, t t i t c 5 g could  you  give e the emo  item or he nited  States, ke?  I  assume  it  ould be  about  1.0 m m f t U Mi w

MR.  SLIFMAN. We  have  not  quantified ,   I  suggested  n y remarks, ut e itas i m b w think t  ill ave  a  relatively  dest  negative  ffect  ith  a  lag n  consumer  spending n  1998. i w h mo e w o i

MS. MINEHAN. Are  declining  quity  rices  asically e ajor  drag hat  ou  have e p b th m t y embedded in  your  figures  or ext ear? f n y

MR.  BROADDUS. I  have  one  quick uestion:  ave,  on  chart  5--I ay be  the nly q D 1 m o one  in  the oom who had  a  little  ouble  ollowing  ll f his--why  oes  the ominal  funds ate  n r tr f a o t d n r i that  lternative  employment targeting mulation  ave  to  go up  more rapidly?   presume  you a un si h I are  keeping mployment  constant  hile roductivity   ncreasing. e w p isi

MR.  STOCKTON. Yes,  but he eason s  that  ou need  to  raise  ates  arlier   hat t r i y r e int episode ecause  you  are  trying  o eep  the nemployment rate  onstant.  f ou did ot  do  that, b t k u c I y n the  strength  emand actually uld outweigh  in  some sense he ncrease  n  supply.  There  is ind wo t i i a bigger ffect  n  our  models  in erms f nvestment  emand and  consumer  spending hat  ctually e i t o i d t a causes he  net ffect  f his  mprovement  in roductivity    be  expansionary  or he conomy. t e o t i p to f t e The  improvement  would  tend o  drive own the nemployment rate  n  the  absence f   rise  n t d u i o a i rates.

On the  national  cene,  t  s nteresting ompare  the reenbook  forecast th  a  range s i i i toc G wi of ther orecasts:  I,  Georgia  State, chigan,  and  our wn. All  these orecasts idence   lot o f DR Mi o f ev a of  similarities  heir  DP  growth  projections r 997  and 1998. The  Greenbook  is ore in  t G fo 1 m optimistic out  inflation,  previously  oted; ore importantly,    aints    picture  f eclining ab as n m it p a o d unemployment rates  hile  most  of he ther orecasts ticipate creasing tes, th  one w t o f an in ra wi showing  no  change  as  I ecall.  hus, hile  the umbers are ot ar part, e eel f he orecasts r T w n n f a th f o t f

Why  is  the reenbook  so  optimistic ,  o  put t  nother  ay,  why is t illing  o  be G or t i a w i w t further  ehind  the urve han  other  orecasters  em to hink  s  wise? Some of his  ptimism b c t f se t i t o could  relate   how wrong we all ave  been  in  our rojections  r he  past ear r  so.  In to h p fo t y o comparison  with  our  Humphrey-Hawkins forecasts   February,  ur  current  orecasts w in o f no suggest  hat  DP  will row faster  han he  highest  orecast   the ebruary ange nd  that  oth t G g t t f in F r a b the  CPI  and  the nemployment  rate  ill  e  lower han he owest orecast. ,  collectively, u w b t t l f So we have  been  wrong.  We  have  underestimated e otential  r he conomy to  grow and  for th p fo t e unemployment to  fall  ithout erious  nflation  mage--in act,  ith  some progress  n  the w s i da f w o overall  nflation  ont. i fr

Should  we be  a  "learning ganization" d  assume  that  his  xperience  an  continue or an t e c through  1997  and  into 998? Or should e remain  skeptical at  he elationships t  rive 1 w th t r tha d other orecasts,  d  ours  as  well,  ill eassert emselves  ooner ather  han ater?  It hould f an w r th s r t l s come as  no  surprise at    am a  bit  keptical.  am skeptical cause  elieve  he actors th I s I be Ib t f damping inflation--medical  t ontainment,  he alue f he  dollar,  restructured  d cos c t v o t a an downsized  business  nvironment--are mporary r  about eaching  he eak  in erms  of heir e te o r t p t t economic  impact.

As I  look  ahead,   see  few,  if  ny, onstraints    growth.  All  the actors ve  been I a c on f ha mentioned: ood  jobs,  igh  levels  f ptimism,  o  particular  scal ag,  nd  reasonable  evels  f g h o o n fi dr a l o

About  the nly egatives  entioned  in  the reenbook  are he rospects  or o n m G t p f a stock arket  correction d  for onsumer  and  business  uying  to  moderate ecause f  stock m an c b b o price  ffects.  s I eep  saying,  eople n  Boston  have  been  telling   for ver  a  year ow that e A k p i me o n consumers  can  only uy so  many cars nd  that usinesses  an  only uy so  many computers. b a b c b However,  it as  been  difficult ee  the ffects  f hat  uildup n tocks icking  n  as  yet,  nd  I h tos e o t b i s k i a wonder when it ill n  1998,  given  all he ositive ctors.  t ay be  that  ncreases   capacity w i t p fa I m i in and  moderating gricultural   energy  prices  ill elp,  ut   also hink t  s ise  to e  skeptical a and w h b I t i i w b about  the mpact  of   stock arket  correction   the eal conomy.

If an t e l n a d 5  years rom  now we are alking  bout  an  expansion hat  s pproximately  0  years ld,  t  ill e f t a t i a 2 o i w b because  the asic rends  hat  ave  characterized  e ast  5  years ave  been  maintained. b t t h th l 1 h

another    years. art f ur  answer  probably ould  be  that    necessary  ut ertainly t 5 P o o w a b c no a sufficient  ndition  s o  prevent  he scalation  nflation.  me of  the ed  watchers--and co i t t e ofi So F some of  us, oo--who  look ack  on  what  we did  in  1994  have  characterized  ose ctions  s t b th a a preemptive nti-inflation  sures.  But  it ould  be  just  s  accurate  o  say  that  hey eflected a mea w a t t r a preemptive nti-recessionary  icy.  hat  is ecause  had  we not  done  what  we did,  elieve  e a pol T b Ib w could  make a  very ood  case hat  e would  have  had  a  1996-1997  recession.  f  e had  failed  o g t w I w t act n  1994 and  inflation  d  accelerated,   would  today  be  facing   higher  nemployment rate i ha we a u than  we currently ve,   lower  level  f utput,  ess  verall  apacity, d  the conomy would  not ha a o o l o c an e feel s  good.  So,  we were  preemptive n  the  sense f eing  anti  nemployment and  preserving a i o b u growth.

When  we turn o  our  future  rospects,   e state  ur bjective   minimizing he isk t p ifw o o as t r that  he ear 000 will urn ut  to e  a  recession  ear,   hink e would  argue  that  t  s ecessary t y 2 t o b y It w i i n but  not  sufficient   revent  ore  inflation  om  emerging  in  1998 and  1999.  If  e are top m fr w successful  n  doing  that, ployment  is oing  to e  higher  nd  output  nd  standards  f iving  re i em g b a a o l a going  to e  higher  hen we get o  the ear 000.  This  is oing  to  be  a  richer  ountry. he b w t y 2 g c T frustration es when we look  at  policy  ptions  or he ear erm, or he  next ear  or wo.  The com o f t n t f t y t latter ten  nvolve aising e  unemployment rate  o revent  nflation,  t he  ultimate jective of i r th t p i bu t ob is reventing  he  emergence  of   recession  nd  unemployment. Sometimes  it  ust  sound  to p t a a m people  out n  Main Street  hat  e had  to reate  nemployment in rder o revent o t w c u o t p unemployment. I  think  e need  to  find ays to  cast  ur  policy lternatives   to ommunicate w w o a and c our  objectives   a  manner  that  oes  not  involve  etarding owth  and  raising employment, in d r r un even  for n  interim  eriod.  here  are ays of hinking  nd  talking  bout he nterim  bjective a p T w t a a t i o of

Let  me focus n  two positive ements n  the  inflation  recast at  upport  he o l i fo h s t Greenbook  story  nd  two  concerns hat  evertheless  ke me very  worried hat  rices  ay rise a t n ma t p m more than  the reenbook  projects. e first sitive ctor  s he nfluence  f n  excellent G Th po fa i t i o a

That  still  aves nanswered  the uestion  f hat  is olding own wages  and  core le u q o w h d inflation  is  ear  despite  he ow  unemployment  rate.  n  my never-ending  ffort   reconcile th y t l I e to low  inflation  d  low  unemployment,  I ave  been  placing  ncreased ight  on  the ontrast an h i we c between  the  apparent  ightness   the abor  arket  and  the eeming  absence f omparable t in l m s o c tightness   the  product  arket.  This s llustrated  the act  hat  hile he revailing 8 in m i i by f t w t p 4. percent  nemployment rate s elow  most  estimates  f AIRU,  the revailing pacity u i b o N p ca utilization e  s nly  a  shade  above  its  stimated  atural  ate.  ooking  at  the istorical  cord rat i o e n r L h re of nemployment and  capacity  tilization es  n  previous  ycles,  ne  reaches he onclusion u u rat i c o t c that  his  isparity     unique eature  f he urrent  pisode. t d isa f o t c e

One way of  appreciating e  significance   his  isparity   o  view  the nemployment th oft d ist u rate n  a  price/price  ecification   he hillips rve  as  a  proxy  for verall cess emand i sp oft P cu o ex d across oth  labor nd  product arkets. iven  that  he  excess emand in  the  labor  arket s b a m G t d m i traditionally  rored y  a  similar  egree f xcess emand in  the roduct arket,  he mir b d o e d p m t unemployment rate  s enerally    reasonably  ood  proxy  for conomy-wide  excess emand. In i g a g e d the  current  ase,  owever,  the nemployment rate  t est s apturing  ightness  he  labor c h u a b i c t int market  and  hence  overstating  e  economy-wide  excess emand. Another  way of eeing his  s th d s t i to  compare  inflation  recasts om  the hillips  rve  using he nemployment  rate  o fo fr P cu t u t specifications  ng apacity  tilization  es.  his  disparity st  likely flects  e  of he ey usi c u rat T mo re on t k

The result   that  ndustrial  pacity  s ncreasing  he  fastest te  n  28  years. he is i ca i i att ra i T net  effect  s hat  hile abor  arkets  are ight, e  increasing oductive pacity  ssociated th i t w l m t th pr ca a wi the  investment  oom has  prevented  xcess emand from  arising   the  product arkets. he b e d in m T much reported  bsence f ricing  everage  hat  irms mphasize  may be  another mplication a o p l t f e i of the  absence f xcess emand in  the  product arkets. othing  gives   firm arket  power  like o e d m N a m excess emand. I  also uspect  hat  irms ave  responded o  the  absence f ricing  everage  y d s t f h t o p l b being  less  illing  o id  aggressively  r orkers,  hereby elping  o  explain  hy wage change w t b fo w t h t w has  increased  o  modestly espite  he revailing ghtness   labor  arkets.

Let  me conclude,  owever,  with wo  reasons hy I  remain  concerned hat  nflation h t w t i may nevertheless  crease  ore than  projected   the taff recast. rst,  e  unemployment  rate in m in s o Fi th averaged .4  percent  n  1996,  close o ost  current  stimates  f AIRU. 5 i t m e o N It as  fallen h significantly ow this  hreshold  or nly  a  couple f onths.  The rise  n  wage change  we bel t f o o m i would  normally nticipate  om  the revailing employment gap  may therefore   just  head. a fr p un be a As I  emphasized  above, he ole f he  capacity  tilization  e  s n  my view  only o  damp rather t r o t u rat i i t than  to  block ntirely  e  effect  f he ower nemployment  rate.  ence,  both  time  and  still e th o t l u H lower  unemployment rates  ose  a  real  hreat  f igher nflation.  cond,  a  coincidence  f p t o h i Se o temporary actors, cluding  eclining  mport rices  ssociated th  the  appreciation  he f in d i p a wi oft dollar,  slowdown in  the  rise  n enefit  osts,  nd  most  recently  decline  n nergy rices  ave a i b c a a i e p h

On balance,  n  the bsence  of urther licy hanges  I  expect bove-trend  rowth  over i a f po c a g coming quarters,  further  ecline  n  the nemployment rate,  nd  still dest  inflation.  rhaps a d i u a mo Pe the  main  message  here  should e  that  his  ould  be  a  remarkably enign utcome.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Phillips.

MS. PHILLIPS.  Thank you, r.  Chairman. A lot f he  suspicions  hat  e discussed M o t t w last  ime  seem to e  a  bit  ore  confirmed. e  have  had  some slowdown in  consumption,  t t b m W a least  or arch through ay. Inflation  pears o  have  remained  well  behaved.  It eems  to e f M M ap t s m that  he uestions  ow before  s  cluster to  wo areas. he first  hether  we really  re t q n u in t T isw a experiencing    slowdown in  the xpansion. f o, ow much?  Is  this  oft  anding ore of  a a e I s h s l m touchdown  to e  followed y  a  takeoff  n he ext ew months? The second  area f uestions b b i t n f o q clusters ound  inflation.  w  is t  ossible  hat  he nflation  cord as  been  so  favorable? ar Ho i p t t i re h How  much longer an  we reap  the enefits  f his  enign  inflationary ironment?  I  have c b o t b env structured  comments around  these wo  sets f  questions. my t o

First, th  respect  o  the actors  ontributing    the ength  nd  perhaps o he wi t f c to l a t t upcoming  strengthening  his  xpansion,  here s ertainly  e ehavior f  the  labor  arket, s oft e t i c th b o m a has  already  een  discussed  round he able  oday. eople  appear o e  coming out f he b a t t t P t b o t

woodwork  to oin he abor orce. he consistent d  now widespread eports  f abor  hortages, j t l f T an r o l s hiring  onuses, nd  retention nuses  are  impressive.  uring  the  intermeeting riod,    made b a bo D pe I several  rips  o he  Midwest  and  the est,  and  I  met  with  several  roups ere  at he oard.  I t t t W g h t B have  been  particularly ressed y  the  labor hortage  tories. ever hought hat   would  be imp b s s I  n t t I hearing  n-migration ggested  nd  accepted s  the nswer  to  Iowa's conomic  challenges. i su a a a e [Laughter]  Business eople re  now talking  bout  and  recognizing  hat  hey ot  only ave  to p a a t t n h locate  nd  transport w workers,  ut hey  also ave  to  train  nskilled rkers  to  meet  their a ne b t h u wo production  eeds.  Clearly, is  ndicates at  he  labor arket  is oing o e  strong or   while.  I n th i th t m g t b f a am not  sure hat    can  quite  uy  into he reenbook  forecast    4.6  percent  nemployment rate t I b t G ofa u through  1998,  but ven  if  he ate  rifts   a  bit,  t  s lear  hat  he .S. ob achine  is live  nd e t r d up i i c t t U j m a a well.  Strong abor arkets ean that  eople  have  the  wherewithal  o  spend, nd  we certainly  e l m m p t a ar seeing he  evidence f hat  n  the ggregate  umbers for etail les nd  housing. t o t i a n r sa a

The second  area hat  as  been  contributing    the trength  f his  xpansion  s usiness t h to s o t e i b fixed  nvestment.    think he undamentals  emain  for rowth  in  that  rea. he overall  ost  f i I t f r g a T c o capital  s ow  for hort-term  nd  long-term  ebt inancing  nd  for oth  internal d  external i l s a d f a b an equity  inancing.  here  is o  capital  hortage  nd  certainly    credit unch.  Profit vels  ave f T n s a no cr le h been  holding p,  and  that  uts anagement in he  mood to xpand  or  at east  o uy  more u p m t e l t b equipment  to  improve  productivity.  e  low  inflation  vironment,   elieve,  specially Th en Ib ise conducive  to apital  nvestment.  n  fact, clining  rices  or omputers nd  information c i I de p f c a technology  ake these nvestments  articularly ble  n  the resence f ight  abor arkets. m i p via i p o t l m The gains n  the roductivity  apital em to  be  encouraging  dditional vestment.  he i p ofc se a in T technology tory  as  been  well  documented, nd  I  think  irms re earning  o anage inventories s h a f a l t m

more closely. hese two  factors  eem to  feed  on  each  other: usiness  nvestment  reates b T s b i c jo opportunities,   a  strong  abor arket  allows ontinued  rowth  in  consumption nd and l m c g a aggregate  emand. I  guess e have  located  r  we are  at east  etting  lose o  a  zone  of d w o l g c t sustainability.

The second  set f uestions  hat    identified  lates   inflation.  y  is t hat  e have o q t I re to Wh i t w had  such  a  favorable  nflationary formance ecently?  hat  performance robably  an  be i per r T p c attributed    a  number of actors.  he  strong ollar  ccompanied  by  low-inflation  ports as to f T d a im h helped o  control  omestic nflation.  creased  usiness  ixed nvestment  as  added  to apacity t d i In b f i h c and  improved  productivity.  e macroeconomic  weakness  of he  economies  of ome of ur Th t s o foreign  rade  artners  as  alleviated  mmodity price  ressures.  here  have  been  no  recent t p h co p T energy  or  food  shocks,  nd  the arm  outlook or 997 is uite avorable  lso. ow, lest  get a f f 1 q f a N we too  cocky, e should emember that  he  BLS  has  made some improvements  to  CPI w r t measurement,  shaving everal  enths  rom  the ndex.  President  oskow  drew  our  attention s t f i M to this.  While  this  s uite    rosy utlook,  do  see onsiderable sks:  he economy could  turn ut i q a o I c ri T o to  be  stronger an  we anticipate. nsumers could eemerge  and  go  on  a  spending pree. s th Co r s A the  international tor  trengthens,   should xpect t  o  be  less f   drag  on GDP  growth, ut sec s we e i t o a b concomitantly  hat  ay bring ack  some inflationary ssures.  ith  respect  o nflation, t m b pre W t i at some point age pressures  ill tart   bite. roductivity  provements  can  only bsorb o w w s o P im a s much. I  believe    key  area or s  to atch  is rofit rgins. f e were  to  see  significant  ofit a f u w p ma I w pr declines, vestment  ctivity uld  slow  and  that  ould rigger  sizable  tock arket  correction. in a wo c t a s m The possibility   uch  a  development  was  certainly ghlighted   the  Greenbook. ofs hi in

In  sum,  while e have  seen  a  bit  f   slowdown in he xpansion,  t  ay already  ave w o a t e i m h come and  gone  or  it  ay be  on  the ay out. t oes  seem  to  me a  bit  oo  soon  to ell,  t he isk m w I d t t bu t r is hat  rowth  may be  more than as  been  anticipated. t g h

We  do  not  have  great  ifferences th he  forecasts  he ther embers so  let  e d wi t oft o m m talk    little  out here  I  think  e are.  Because  monetary  policy  orks with ong  and  variable a ab w w w l lags,  s  we all  now,  we must  consider  hat  will appen  18 to  36  months  from  now,  not hat  is a k w h w happening oday.

What we do  not now is hy they  have  not  been  working.  My  feel,  s  was discussed k w a at ength  t he ast  eeting,  s hat  e have  been  underestimating  d  we continue  o l a t l m i t w an t

The paper  starts   approaching  he ssue f ow we measure  inflation.  tart by t i o h I  s a different  y. I  start  asking ow I  should efine he  condition  f oninflation  cause  prices wa by h d t o n be are  changing ll  he ime o  some degree.  Noninflation  e is   condition  n  which  the a t t t tom a i weighted  average f hose rices  hat  re  rising  s ust  atched  by  the eighted verage f hose o t p t a i j m w a o t prices  hat  re alling. is mmediately ets o  the  question, ices  f hat? How  do we want t a f Th i g t pr o w to  use  the oncept f nflation    talking  bout hat  we are rying  o revent r  minimize? In  a c o i in a w t t p o gold  standard  orld  that  as fairly sy  because eople n  such  a  world  were  conditioned  he w w ea p i tot notion hat  nflation  ant  it  ook ore  gold  dust r uggets o  buy  the ame thing. t i me t m o n t s

Unfortunately,   in  the odem  world  have  gotten  nto  he  habit f alking  bout nflation we m i t o t a i in terms  of ising  rices  f hings  nstead  f n  increase  n he umber of oney units  t  akes o r p o t i o a i t n m i t t buy  those hings,  hich  is eally at  inflation   nd what  we want  to  measure. t w r wh isa

Regarding  what  to  measure, e are ondemned to  live n   world  now and  forever  n w c i a i which  we can  only istribute  d  consume what  we produce.  Brezhnev  thought hat uch  a d an t s world  was the esult  f   capitalist t;  e  never iscovered  arkets. ur inflation  asure  has r o a plo h d m O me to  relate  o utput  ver ime, hich  does  not  mean we should gnore sset  rices.  ltimately, t o o t w i a p U it

has  to e  a  weighted verage f he  prices  f hings  hat  eople uy and  consume over ime. b a o t o t t p b t Some of  those rices  lways  seem  to  go  up;  tickets  leveland ndian aseball  ames certainly p a toC I b g do. Some prices  o  down; computer  prices  ertainly  . We  are rying  o  find ome way to g c do t t s normalize ll f  that  nformation  bout  prices  n  the inds  of eople  and  get hem  thinking  hat, a o i a i m p t t yes, ome prices  re lways  going  up,  some are  always  going  down. We  want  them  to  see rice s a a p changes  as  averaging ut. hat  is hat  I  mean by  noninflation. o T w

I  think  ur  price ndex as  to e  the roadest  ossible  easure  of utput  rices, t e o i h b b p m o p bu w also ave  to  have  information  bout  asset  rices.  hat oes  not ean that  e necessarily  nt  to h a p T d m w wa include  sset  rices  n ur  statistical  sure.  With  regard o he  relevant eory,  lchian  and a p i o mea t t th A Kessel  developed   theoretical  amework  about  30  years go, nd  Alchian nd  Klein  did  further a fr a a a work in  the arly 970s.

If e look  at  the ata ith  which  we are  working,  art f ur  problem  as  we have w d w p o o discussed  efore round  this  able  elates  he  fact  hat  n  increasing oportion  f ominal b a t r tot t a pr o n GDP  involves  tems hose prices,   we define nd  estimate  hem,  have  been  undergoing ery i w as a t v significant  clines  anging p  to  15,  20,  or ven  30  percent  er ear.   will rgue  tomorrow  that de r u e p y I a industries counting  or   percent  f he ominal  GDP  created  bout  a  third  f he ncrease  n ac f 3 o t n a o t i i the  real DP  over  the ast ear.

One of  the ifficulties  ated  y  all f his  s hat  t  nvolves  ery  tough  conceptual d cre b o t i t i i v and  measurement  problems  for s.

Jerry ordan  said,  he  question  s hether e are  looking t he  inflation   rices  r he  decline J t i w w a t ofp o t in  the urchasing  ower  of oney. In  this  ontext, en  if  e get o  the oint here  we are ot p p m c ev w t p w n able  to efine ery  explicitly  e nit f roduction  r  bundle  of oods  or  services  nvolved  n d v th u o p o g i i particular  minal  dollar  ales  nd  hence  are nable o  define xactly  hat  constitutes  ice, no s a u t e w pr there  s o  question  hat  e will till ve  a  nominal  interest  te ut here.  n inflation i n t w s ha ra o t A premium is  of ecessity plicit   the ominal  interest  te. e  may not  be  able  to  define n im in n ra W a particular  ice,  ut n  the nd  we know that  arkets  are perating  n  the asis f ome notion f pr b i e m o o b o s o prices.  hen  we move into he  21st entury,  hat  we will ry o  stabilize  y in  effect  e  the W t c w t t ma b purchasing  ower of oney, however  that s  measured. p m i

The reason   raise  hese uestions  s ot hat e have  to  worry  much about hem  in  the I t q i n t w t current  eriod,  s  I oted.  All  I  wish  to ut n  the able  s he otion  hat,   we respond o he p a n p o t i t n t as t t excellent  aper y  Dave Stockton nd  his olleagues,   bear n ind that  t  s  a  paper  that  eally p b a c we i m i i r refers  o  the earer  erm.  The problems hat  e will e  dealing  ith  as  we get eyond  the urn f t n t t w b w b t o the  century  re  going o  be  increasingly  fficult  resolve  nd  in  fact  o efine.  There  is o a t di to a t d n conceptual  roblem  involved  n efining  ominal  GDP, and  we can  in  principle lculate   own p i d n ca itd to  the ast  ollar  r  even  the ast  ent f  e know how to easure  it  orrectly.   s l d o l c i w m c Iti unambiguously  defined. he  unit f roduction  s ot; rice  s ot.  So,  I  think he roblems  that T o p i n p i n t p we will ave  to  deal ith  in efining  hat  we are  stabilizing   going  to  increase  n he ears h w d w are i t y ahead.  What I  want  to  suggest  s hat  e confront  he  question  f hether e are  trying  o i t w t o w w t stabilize  ices  r  trying  o tabilize  e inancial stem.  That  is  where  the ssue  f sset  rices pr o t s th f sy i o a p comes in; t  s n  a  certain nse ositioned   a  continuum  that  egins ith  spot rices  or nits i i i se p on b w p f u of  goods  and  services.

In  sum,  I  am speculating at  e are  going  to  have  problems  that  re  quite ifferent th w a d from  those hat  e have  today. hile I  am not  saying hat  hese nvolve ssues  hat  e need  to t w W t t i i t w resolve  oday,    suspect  hat  e will tart   confront  hem  in  5 years r  certainly  thin 0  years, t I t w s to t o wi 1 and  they ay very  well  affect  ur  projections  ing  out o, ay,  he  year 006.  I  also uspect  hat m o go t s t 2 s t by  around  the ear 006,  this  ery  tricky  uestion  ay involve hat  we are  endeavoring  o y 2 v q m w t stabilize  d  may be  the  focus f ur  policy  ctions.  y  own guess  is hat  e are oing  to e an o o a M t w g b dealing  ith  asset  rices, e  question  f ominal  long-term  nterest  tes, d  probably he w p th o n i ra an t outlook or ominal  GDP  as  well.  In  any  event,  ur  task  ill urely  e  tougher han  it  s oday, f n o w s b t i t and  the ssue  ill e  how we should roceed.  For  the oment, fortunately, t  s ot  an  issue. i w b p m tha i n All  this  robably s iolating esident Teer's  view  that  e should ust  it  nd  enjoy t, t  I p i v Pr Mc w j s a i bu did  want  to ention  that    have  a  different  t f orries. omorrow, I  will  aise  he m I se o w T r t conventional  orries. w

One of  the hings    wanted  to ention  is y hope  that  ome of he  conclusions   the t I m m s t in memo  and  some of ur  discussion  ere ill ind heir  ay into he  Humphrey-Hawkins report. o h w f t w t I say  that  ecause   think  e need  to ive  some thought o onditioning ople o  recognize  hat b I w g t c pe t t we are hinking  bout  a  broad ange  of  issues  nd  trends  s  opposed  to oncentrating    just  ne t a r a a c on o interest  te. t s  my impression  hat  e are  seen  as  focusing  nly n  the ed unds  rate  hen in ra I i t w o o f f w fact  e are  looking t  some longer-term  ssues  nd  what  monetary  policy  an  contribute w a i a c to sustainable  onomic  growth.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let  me just  aise  ne  caveat o  that.  If  e were r o t w involved  n  an  objective d  wholly  academic  discussion, ould  agree  with  that i an I  w wholeheartedly.  am fearful  hat  here  re eople ut here  ho are ooking or ny  reason o I t t a p o t w l f a t presume  that    sound-money, awkish  view  a  la cTeer is he  wrong  view.

MS. PHILLIPS.  I  understand.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I  would  be  very oncerned hat  t  ould  be  misread s c t i w a meaning  that  e have  abandoned  our  objectives    stable  urrency nd  stable  nflationary w ofa c a i pressures.  onetheless,  t  s  an  issue  hat s oing o merge,  and  I  do  think  e have  to onfront N i i t i g t e w c

a  lot f roadened  policy  ssues  n  Humphrey- Hawkins testimony.    am a  little  rvous bout o b i i I ne a the ay the  political  stem  is perating.    do  not ant  to  say  that  ur  monetary  policy  as  been w sy o I w o h exceptionally  od,  although    think t  as  in act  een  quite ood.

MR. MELZER. Thanks,  Alan.  I, oo, ant  to  thank he taff r   good  job  of t w t s fo a analyzing  hese ssues, d  I  also ppreciate ving  this  atter n the  agenda.  These  are opics t i an a ha m o t that  e need  to  be  talking  bout.  I  see  this  ith   shorter-term  cus han ou  were  talking w a w a fo t y about,  ut  I  feel  hat  e could enefit  t he ppropriate me  by  being ore clear  mong b t w b a t a ti m a ourselves  nd  eventually th  the ublic  bout ur  objectives d  by  being  more transparent a wi p a o an

regarding  hat  we specifically   trying  o  accomplish. o,  I  think  e need  to  be  looking t nd w are t S w a a talking  bout his  ort  f hing. a t s o t

From that  erspective,  me of he  things    took  away from  this  nalysis  ncluded, rst p so t I a i fi of  all,  he esirability ocusing  n a  broad  measure  of nflation.  at  certainly ises  uestions t d of  f o i Th ra q in  my mind  about he  focus hat  e as  an  institution  e  placed n  core  CPI.  Even now, some t t w hav o of he  analysis  nd  some of he imulations   the  Greenbook  focus n  core  CPI  and  core  PCE, t a t s in o and  I  wonder  whether hese easures  are  what  we ought  to e  looking t n  these onger-term t m b a i l simulations.   probably ave  created  n  impression  ith  the ublic nd  the  financial rkets We h a w p a ma that  ore PI is  what  we really  are bout.  I  don't  hink e need  to hange  that  mpression  n c C c a t w c i i the  near erm, ut  I elieve  here's  good  bit f eeling  ut here  hat  ore  CPI is ur  focus;  t t b b t a o f o t t c o a least  hat  s y  sense. t i m

I  thought he nsight  ith  respect  o ates  ersus  evels  as  very  interesting.  early, t i w t r v l w Cl if  e were  going o  go  in  this  irection,  en ather  han ebating  hat  the deal  ndex ould  be w t d th r t d w i i w and  setting s  evel,  t  ould  simplify  hings  reatly  ecognize  hat  he ndices  ove broadly it l i w t g tor t t i m together  ver ime  and  to  focus n  rates, alizing  at  e are  a  good  distance  way from  price o t o re th w a stability.  at  might  be  a  good  first ep.   was also nterested   he ensitivity lysis  ith Th st I i int s ana w respect  o  fluctuations   lus r  minus 1 ercentage  oint rom  a  fixed  arget.  n  general,    feel t ofp o p p f t I I that  f  e go  in his  irection,   have  to  be  looking t he  trend n nflation  ther  han   point i w t d we a t i i ra t a estimate.  robably he  way to  capture  hat  dea s o  think  n  terms f ome range  around P t t i i t i o s a particular  te.   thought t  as interesting t  he  plus r  minus 1  percentage  oint hat  ost ra I i w tha t o p t m people  would  think  bout n  terms f   reasonable  ange oes  not enerate  arger  ariations a i o a r d g l v on the  real ide n  these imulations an  those e have  experienced.  n  my view,  one  of he s i s th w I t

assumptions  hat  ne  would  have  to uestion  s he  tradeoff  tween  the nflation  te nd  the t o q i t be i ra a output ap. In  fact,  suppose  one  could  argue hat  f  e had  lower  and  more stable  ates  f g I t i w r o inflation, would also ngender  more stable  utput.

MR.  STERN. Let  me make several  rief  bservations:   terms  of he eneral b o In t g question  f he  overall  alue f ow  inflation, eems  to  me that  e actually ve  developed o t v o l it s w ha some evidence.  If  e think bout he  performance f he  U.S.  economy in  the  1960s, uch of w a t o t m the  1980s, nd  much of his  ecade, hose ave  been  periods f ery  favorable  conomic a t d t h o v e performance  and  periods  f elatively  w inflation.  is oes  not  prove  causality,  t f  e step o r lo Th d bu i w away from  the  rigor  hat  conomists ight  want  to  apply  and  think f he eneral  ublic,  eems t e m o t g p its

to  me that  e are  in he rocess  f eveloping ome very ractical  idence. hat  does  not  get  to w t p o d s p ev T what  I  think  s he ougher  uestion--and gree ith arry  Meyer and  Cathy  Minehan on  this-i t t q I  a w L of  demonstrating  hat  here  s   significant  yoff  o  reducing  nflation  rther om,  say,   or t t i a pa t i fu fr 3 2-1/2 ercent.    think  hat  s   very  significant  allenge.    don't  hink  e have  the vidence hat p I t i a ch I t w e t would  convince  skeptics  hat  hat  s   sensible d sound  thing  o  do. t t i a an t

Finally, d  I  raise  his  nly  as  a  question, onder  whether t  s referable  ave  a an t o I  w i i p toh basket f  inflation  asures  as  opposed  to  one  measure.  This  paper uggests  hat  s  long s  we o me s t a a pick  a  broad ndex, e are ot  in  any  danger f oing  significantly  ourse ver  an  extended i w n o g offc o period f  time.

What we need o l t a st a w s b g to  do, t eems  to  me,  is o  reinforce   n  every ay we can.  One dimension f rice tability i s t it i w o p s for me is  not ust  he urrent  nflation  mbers, ut  the ery  important  xpectational  mponent. j t c i nu b v e co We  need  to  reinforce e  view  that  e are oing  to aintain  he rogress  e have  made,  and  I th w g m t p w think hat  ill ay  off  ver ime.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. We  turn o  a  discussion  f he ong-run  anges or he t o t l r f t monetary  aggregates, d  I  call  n  Tom  Simpson. an o

MR.  SIMPSON. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. I  will e  referring    the andout alled b to h c "Material  or taff  resentation    Money and  Debt  Ranges." [Statement  nd  related ndout-f S P on a ha see  Appendix.]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Tom, going  back  to  the  bottom  panel f xhibit  , o E 3 I would  assume  that f  e were  to  substitute  oss omestic ncome  for ross omestic roduct, i w gr d i g d p the ost  recent  ata ould  not ook  as  good  as  they o  because  we would  be  getting gher  2. m d w l d hi V

MR.  SIMPSON. Right, he  points  ould  be  farther art. t w ap

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Have you actually  one  the alculations    see  what  that d c to would  look  like? n  other ords, s art f he  tightness  it  hat  e see  a  function  f he I w i p o t off t w o t widening  statistical  crepancy  n  the ational counts r  is t  e  minimis? dis i n ac o i d

MR. PRELL.  I  think  e are  only  talking out  .02 n  this  cale.    don't  hink  t w ab o s I t i would  greatly  lter  he  recent  icture. a t p

MR.  KOHN. Especially  f  he evision nt  back  a  couple  of ears. i t r we y

MR. PRELL.  It's  question f tarting ints  or hinking  bout his. a o s po f t a t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. But  the  gap  has  been  opening p  since 994,  so  V2 u 1 shifts  progressively  er  time  from  the bservations u  have  here. he most  recent up ov o yo T observations e  on  top  of he  fitted ne,  o  we would  expect   little  re of   drift. ar t li s a mo a

MR.  SIMPSON. It ould  alter e  slope. c th

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I  don't  now  how significant  s, ut t oes  raise k i i b i d some questions.  ince  we have  so  few observations,    s ot  clear  o  me what  is appening. S it i n t h President  arry. P

MR. PARRY. Also  with  reference   Exhibit  it  eems to e that  evelopments  n to 3, s m d i the  last  ouple f ears learly e  encouraging. c o y c ar If we focus  on  the ottom  panel f he xhibit, b o t e it lso eems clear  hat elocity  s ontinuing  o  change.  In  particular,  ne  had  run  that a s t v i c t if o regression  o  include  he orecast riod,  t ould  have  produced  a  different  locity.  o,  this t t f pe i w ve S exhibit  eems  encouraging  o  me,  but  it  lso llustrates  t  t  ould be  a  mistake o  assume  that s t a i tha i w t velocity  s ow stable. i n

MR.  SIMPSON. Right.  As was mentioned  in  the  Bluebook, e thought hat  2 w t M velocity  as  being oosted omewhat this  ear w b s y by continuing  ery  large nflows o  mutual  funds, v i t presumably  involving  iversions om  M2  accounts. d fr

MR.  KOHN. It s  also he ase  that  hen we fit  hese hings  conometrically,   find i t c w t t e we small ime  trends  oth  for he  period overed t b t c by the  bottom  line  nd  for hat  overed a t c by the  top. Thus,  the  charts  how bigger  isses elative    the itted ne  han here  re  in ur  models s m r to f li t t a o because  the odels  have  this  ime rend n  them. But  think  our  basic oint  s till  rrect.  n m t t i I y p i s co I some sense,  t s mazing  how little  locity  as  shifted   given he uge  flows nto  tock i i a ve h up t h i s mutual  funds.

MR.  SIMPSON. If ou  look t  the pper  panel,  n  alternative  terpretation  ld  be y a u a in wou that  he ig  upward  movement in  the arly  art f he  1990s  has  slowed  rather  han ome to  an t b e p o t t c end.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Other  questions? resident rdan. P Jo

MR. JORDAN. A couple  of hings: ith  regard o our  question, .  Chairman, e t W t y Mr w too  have  looked t his  ith  gross omestic urchases  nstead  f ominal  GDP  and  also he a t w d p i o n t command  basis f  GDP. o That's  ecause  we are  trying  o  relate ney held o  household b t mo t income  and  the  command  of .S.  citizens er  resources.  t oes  change  the icture    little.  e U ov I d p a Th statistical  ationship   ZM rel ofM is etter  n  terms f he  stability  the  functional lationship. b i o t of re The series  s olatile cause  of he  higher  nterest asticity,   e still  t   tighter t  ith i v be t i el butw ge a fi w MZM,  especially   e use  gross omestic urchases r  the ommand  basis. if w d p o c

My  other uestion,    real uestion,  ow to omplete he icture  f he  NAIRU q a q ish c t p o t alternative.  e  Bluebook  presents  lmost  a  "for our  information" nd  of lternative  at Th a y ki a th assumes  the  NAIRU is .8  percent,  nd  then t  eally  oesn't   anything ith t.  t ould  be 4 a i r d do w i I w helpful,   me anyway,  to  have  Exhibit    completed o nclude hat  would  be  implied or he to 4 t i w f t velocities   he hree  ggregates  nder  that  ssumption nd  then he  appropriate nges or he oft t a u a a t ra f t aggregates.  ou might  choose  not  to  change  the  nominal  funds ate,  o  opportunity sts  ould Y r s co w not  change, ut he  lower  NAIRU b t has  to ave  an  implication r our hoice f he  appropriate h fo y c o t ranges.

MR.  SIMPSON. As I  mentioned, ith  a  supply hock  of his  ort  nd  particularly w s t s a if the  Committee  wanted  to ee  more of hat  hock  show through n erms f  real  utput,  would s t s i t o o we get  more nominal  GDP  and  more money growth.

MR. KOHN. On that  ow NAIRU l alternative,  would  have  small ffects we e on nominal  GDP  and  lower  inflation.    s ot  clear  hich  way nominal  GDP  would  go  since e Iti n w w would  have  higher utput  nd  lower  inflation.  tually,  think ominal  GDP  would  be  a  bit o a Ac I n lower  in hat  cenario  han n  the aseline  cenario.  nterest  tes  ould  not e  rising,  ich t s t i b s I ra w b wh

would  help  boost 2, but  nominal  GDP  would  be  a  little er  because nflation  uld  be  so M low i wo much lower.  So,  I  don't  now which  way it  ould  go,  but y guess s hat  he et ffect  ould k w m i t t n e w not  alter r  projection  2  a  great  eal. ou ofM d

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Any further  uestions  or om? q f T Governor  Phillips. MS. PHILLIPS.  Tom, could ou  expand  a  bit  n Exhibit ,  hich  shows growth  in y o 1 w federal  ebt urning  p? d t u

MR.  SIMPSON. That  is asically    keeping ith  the lightly  rger  eficit  at  e b in w s la d th w are  projecting r  1998. fo

MS. PHILLIPS.  Does that  ake he  current  udget egotiations  to ccount? t t b n in a

MR.  SIMPSON. It as  our ssumed  fiscal ckage. h a pa

MS. PHILLIPS.  Okay.

MR.  PRELL.  You will ecall  hat ur  unified  eficit  recast r he  next iscal  ear s r t o d fo fo t f y i somewhat larger  han  the eficit  r his  iscal ar.  On a  calendar-year  sis, cause f he t d fo t f ye ba be o t timing f  borrowing  and  other eans of ayment  or  cash  flows n  the ederal  overnment,  e o m p i f g w have  more of  a  step-up  n orrowing han  one  would  have  expected n  the asis f he  unified i b t o b o t deficits  r he  two  fiscal  ears. fo t y

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Any further  uestions  or om? q f T It trikes  that  2 s me M is reeping  ts ay back  into otential e.  This  creates  nteresting  estions  ncluding  he eed c i w p us i qu i t n to  review  issues  hat  ere  raised  esterday  uch  as  reserve  equirements  nd  contemporaneous t w y s r a reserves.  ll hese ssues, cluding  he onger-term  arget  anges,  re n  the ame package.  That A t i in t l t r a i s is  to he xtent  hat  2  has  no  appreciable netary  policy  ignificance, n, f ourse,  he t e t M mo s the o c t ranges re  irrelevant  cept n  the ense hat  hey  have  a  technical aning as  do  reserve a ex i s t t me

That  is ecause nything  e do  that  s ot  required  y  sweeps, or xample, r a b a w i n b f e o other navoidable  echnical oblems  elevates  he  issue f oney supply o  a  level  hat  oes  not u t pr t o m t t d conform  with he  way in hich  we currently ploy  the  monetary  aggregates. t w em

My  impression  f he  current  anges or he  aggregates  s hat  t  some point  e o t r f t i t a w probably ill ave  to  change  them  to apture  nd  center  he xpected utcomes.  But  for ow I w h c a t e o n would be  inclined  imply  to  reproduce hat  we wrote  6  months  and  12 months  ago  as  reasons s w for ot  changing he  ranges nd  save  ourselves    lot f ypeface.  here  you  have  a  true  ost n t a a o t T c cutter  t he ederal eserve!  [Laughter]  It s ather  ascinating    recall  ow good  the orecasts a t F R i r f to h f for he  growth  of he ggregates  ave  been.  In  retrospect,  2  forecast  f   year go  was t t a h heM o a a right  n  the oney. If  2  growth  continues  hat  ay,  we will ave  to  make a  decision, d  a o m M t w h an very  significant  cision, out  the 2  range.  The irony f aving  such  a  good  forecast  hat de ab M o h ist we are  exactly  here  we were  a  year go.  My  own preference, ankly, uld  be  to  retain  he w a fr wo t ranges hat  e have. t w

MR. JORDAN. I  agree  with hat  o he  extent  hat  e decide ot  to hange  the  way t t t t w n c we use  the anges or he  monetary  aggregates. ut  in  anticipation   he  possibility t  n  one, r f t B oft tha i two,  three r  more Humphrey-Hawkins  hearings  own  the oad  we may want  to  give   little o d r a different  ight  to  the nformation  2  is roviding,  think t  ould  be  useful  o  start eparing we i M p I i w t pr the  Congress  and  the ublic  or he  change.  We  would  alert em  that  he hange  would  not  be  a p f t th t c return  o  the 970s  kind f onetary  targeting  t  rather  hat  e intended  o se  these ggregates t 1 o m bu t w t u a as  a  contemporaneous onitor f ow our  policy  ctions  re nteracting  th  the eal conomy. I m o h a a i wi r e believe  t ould  be  a  mistake o  allow eople n  the utside  o  think hat  e will  o  back  to i w t p o o t t w g

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. We  actually  ave  started   do  that  t he ringes h to a t f in Congressional  estimony. f  hese elationships d,    think e will radually  ncrease  ur t I t r hol I w g i o emphasis  on  the ggregates.  n  that  vent,  his  ommittee  is oing  to each   crucial  oint  hen a I e t C g r a p w we will ave  to  decide hether e should  start  o  do something ore formal. hat  is oing  to e h w w t m T g b an  interesting cussion,    part  ecause   think  ach  of s  will ave  slightly  fferent  me dis in b I e u h di ti frames  in  mind.

MR. PARRY. Mr.  Chairman,  I  agree ith  your  suggestion  nd  support lternative w a a I. It eems  to  me that  2  velocity  oming closer  o  stabilizing,     don't  hink e have  enough s M isc t butI t w evidence et o  put  more weight  on  the  aggregates  t  this  ime. y t a t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  roaddus. B

MR. BROADDUS. Mr.  Chairman,  I  certainly  ree ith  your ecommendation.  I ag w r have  to  say  that    am impressed  y  the ncreasing idence hat  2  may be  coming  back  on I b i ev t M track.  e  produced  some supporting  esearch  t ur  Bank to upplement he xcellent aff W r a o s t e st

We  were  left  ith  interest h t f b w w rates  ecause e had  no  alternative.  hink  t s till    a  sense ur  official  licy  hat  f  e can b w I  t i i s in o po t i w find   way back  to  where  we are ble o arget  he  money supply r et orrowed  reserves  r a a t t t o n b o

some other on-interest  asure  instead  f he ederal  unds  rate,  would  like o  do  that.    am n me o t f f we t I not  sure e will  e  able o eturn  o uch  a  regime nd  in  the rocess reate    whole  new army of w b t r t s a p c a Fed  watchers ho interpret  at  we are  doing,  ut  the eason s ot  that  e enthusiastically w wh b r i n w embrace  targeting  e  federal  unds ate.  e  did  it  s  an  unfortunate llback  hen we had  no th f r W a fa w other  ptions,  nd  I hink  he onsequences re  much as  we anticipated.  e way to  get round o a t t c a Th a this  roblem  is o eet  it ead  on,  and  instead  f  saying hat  e are oving rates  p  to urb p t m h o t w m u c inflation, should  say  that  e are oving them  up  to  sustain  ong-term  mployment growth. we w m l e That  is ffectively  at  our  argument  is, nd  it  s he ight  rgument.  It nvolves  ypassing  he e wh a i t r a i b t intermediate flationary  balances ssue  n  a  lot f hese iscussions. in im i i o t d

My  opinion s hat  rom  a  public elations  int f  view  it  s ery  hard o  sell  ow i t f r po o i v t l inflation  en we already  ave  low inflation.  orks  only  in  a  period  ike  he ate 970s  when wh h Itw l t l 1 everyone  was terrified   he onsequences f nflation  d  the ederal eserve  effectively  d  a oft c o i an F R ha mandate.  We  do  not  have  a  mandate  now,  and  the eason s hat  e have  been  successful.   s r i t w Iti the  fallout  eing  successful at  e have  to andle.  It s   very  difficult   complex  public ofb th w h i a and relations  sue.  ut  we have  to ealize at  f  e fail  o  succeed n  the ublic elations,   may is B r th i w t i p r we still  ve  to  move ahead  and  do  what  we have  to  do  and  take he onsequences. e  still  ve  to ha t c W ha do  our ob. j

MR. BROADDUS. I  agree ith  all f hat.  y point s hat  hile  we currently ve w o t M i t w ha low  inflation, do  not  really  ave  what  I  would regard s  a  firm ominal nchor  in we h a n a a forward-looking nse.  In  that  ind  of nvironment,  he  operating  egime  that  e have, s  you se k e t r w a said,  resents  isks.    don't  now if  here  s n  easy ay to o  it,  ut e need  to  take very p r I k t i a w d b w e opportunity  o  make it lear  hat  hort  ates  ill ove around.  They  may have  to  go  up, nd  that t c t s r w m a

may be  perceived  s  an  effort  n  our art  o  squeeze he  economy in rder o  reduce nflation a o p t t o t i or hit ome target.  hat  is ot orrect  conomics, nd  we need  to  get  that  oint  cross ny  way we s T n c e a p a a can.

MR. MOSKOW. Mr.  Chairman,   agree  with our  recommendation.  As I  understand I y it,  e would describe  he  money ranges s  we did ast  ime, amely  as  benchmarks  for hat  we w t a l t n w would  normally xpect nder  conditions  f easonable  rice tability  d  historic  locity e u o r p s an ve behavior.

With regard o  the  discussion u  were  having  with l  Broaddus,   few of s  were t yo A a u talking  bout  the ame issue  efore he  meeting.  I  think  he  sense f ur  discussion  as  to  agree a s b t t o o w completely  ith  exactly  ow you  phrased he  need  to  communicate  the asis  or ur  monetary w h t b f o policy  ctions, mely  by saying hat  ur  objective   to  encourage ontinued  ecovery,  ustained a na t o is c r s economic  growth, nd  further creases  n mployment. I  realize at  his  s   very  difficult a in i e th t i a and complex  public  elations sue,  s  you  said,  ut  I  think  hat  s he ight  rack  o  go  on. r is a b t i t r t t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I  will  ell  ou, ike,  one  thing  hat  as  to  be  considered t y M t h here  is he oral  tone.  In he YU t m t N speech,   said hat  t  s rresponsible  take he  risks  hat  re I t i i i to t t a involved  n  not rying  o  contain  nflationary alances. f e give  only  the ther  ide f he i t t i imb I w o s o t argument,  hey ill eat s  nine  times ut  of ine n  a  moral  argument.  That  is hat  they ave t w b u o n o w h been  doing.  And if  e allow  that  o appen, e deserve o e  beat pon  because  I  am persuaded w t h w t b u that  e do  have  the oral  high  ground.  We  have  a  long-term  ocus ather an   short-term w m f r th a expediency ationale.    believe  n  insurance, ich  is   well  established  ng-term  isk-averse r We i wh a lo r type  of ctivity. hink  ll  he thical, ral  issues  re  on  our  side.  Short-termism--all he a I  t a t e mo a of  t

expediency ssues--is  at  effectively   n  the  other ide,  nd  their  dvocates  ake it  ound  as i wh iso s a a m s though  that  s he oral  high  ground.  I  think  ur  allowing  hat  o  happen  is nfortunate. i t m o t t u It merely  says ow good  they  are,  ecause  if    had  to ake their se,    would  not  be  able o o  it h b I m ca I t d as  well s  they. a

MR. MOSKOW. I  agree ith verything  ou  have  just  aid.   believe  hat  e need  to w e y s I t w spend  more time hinking  bout ow we can  best ommunicate  that  essage. t a h c m

Mr.  Chairman,  I  agree hat  e should dopt t w a alternative    I  think  t  s ar oo arly  o  conclude hat  he ecent  it   V2,  and  therefore e se I. i i f t e t t t r f in th u of  M2, is nything  ike    sure hing.  ne of he hings   elieve  e have  to  be  aware  of s he a l a t O t t Ib w i t effect  f  a  change  in arket ocus n  a  monetary  measure.  We  may have  a  monetary  aggregate o m f o that  racks  easonably  ell hen we are  not sing t s  a  policy  ool. herefore,  t  s   matter  f t r w w u i a t T i i a o passing nterest  t  essentially   ndifference    the arketplace.  n the  other  and, f  e start i bu ofi to m O h i w using t s  a  tool,  he arkets re  going  to oncentrate   it    lot  ore,  and  it  ay pick p a i a t m a c on a m m u degree  of olatility ated  nly o  its  eing sed  as  a  policy  ool. v rel o t b u t

On the  broader ssue  f xplaining  hat  we are  doing, t  eems  to e that i o e w i s m a concentration    economic growth  and  the reation  f  obs s here  the igh  ground  is ocated on c o j i w h l and  is hat  we appropriately  e edicated  o.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes,  granted  ow far e have  come. I  think he nly h w t o way we could  go  back  to  some non-interest-rate me--let's ume  it nvolved    net orrowed regi ass i a b reserve  umber--would  be  if  e believed  hat  nalytically h  an  approach ad  become the n w t a suc h most  efficient  ans to  implement  policy.  e  could dentify r  net orrowed  reserves  arget, me W i ou b t but  instead  f ssociating   ith  that  uge  range hat  e used  to  set or he  federal  unds ate, o a it w h t w f t f r we could  indicate at  e expected t  o e  consistent  th  a  federal  unds ate ithin    relatively th w i t b wi f r w a narrow  range.  So,  we would still   act  ave  some focus n  the  federal  unds ate. f e believe inf h o f r I w that  he iteral  xing  f he  federal  unds ate  s n  inappropriate  licy--a nclusion  e may t l fi o t f r i a po co w well each  at ome point ecause heoretically  's  ry  hard  to ake a  case hat ixing  he ate  s r s b t it ve m t f t r i the  optimal ay to  conduct onetary  policy--how  e would  reword  the irective  uld be  of w m w d wo some importance,  ut  we would  then ave  what  we would  view  as  a  superior  echanism to arry b h m c out  our  policy.  e  could xplain  hat  e expected his  pproach o  policy  o  engender   federal W e t w t a t t a funds  rate  etween, ay, -1/4 nd  5-1/2 ercent  r  some narrow  range ike  hat. b s 5 a p o l t

MR. MEYER. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. Tom  Simpson's resentation    the p of Bluebook  alternatives  he  Humphrey-Hawkins ranges dentified  o  distinct  cisions  hat fort i tw de t we have  to  make today,  nd  also   third  ecision  hat  e might  want  to  talk  bout nd a a d t w a a contemplate. he first   the  interpretation he  ranges;  he  second  is he oundary  of he T is of  t t t b t ranges;  nd  the hird  s hether e want  to  upgrade  the ole f onetary  aggregates  n  our a t i w w r o m i monetary  policy  rocess. p

I  must  admit  that  hen I  came here,    was initially  asy  about he urrent w I une t c interpretation he  M2  range  that  elated  o ome hypothetical  riod f rice  tability of  t r itt s pe o p s and normal  velocity  ehavior. hat  interpretation  med to  me to e  inconsistent  th he  spirit  d b T see b wi t an the  letter  he ederal eserve  Act.  But  I  have  come to  appreciate at  uch  an  interpretation oft F R th s might  have  evolved s  a  quite  easonable  ompromise,  given he  instability he onetary a r c t of  t m aggregates.  n the ne  hand, e are old o  set   range.  On the  other, e nstability he O o w t t a th i of  t monetary  aggregates  revents  s  from  doing o  in  a  meaningful ay--or rom  using he onetary p u s w f t m aggregates  n  a  meaningful ay--in he  policy  rocess.  ow  that  here  s vidence f mproved i w t p N t i e o i stability   2, I  think  e have  to sk  whether his  ontinues  o  be  a  reasonable  ompromise. ofM w a t c t c

I  agree ith he  Chairman  that  espite  arly igns f mproved  M2  stability,  s w t d e s o i it i premature o  reach hat  onclusion.    would say  that  e really ve  not tress-tested  s t t c I w ha s thi relationship  t.  It as  proved  stable  hrough   very  tranquil riod,  nd  I  don't  hink  e want ye h t a pe a t w to  make the ove back  to  the arlier terpretation   then ave  to  reverse  urselves  hen we m e in and h o w find hat  e are  in   more turbulent riod. t w a pe

Having  said hat,    think  he luebook  also hallenges  s  a  bit  ecause t oints  ut t I t B c u b i p o that  ome interesting  sues  re nvolved n  setting e arget  anges nder he  current s is a i i th t r u t

The discussion   the luebook  is ery  interesting. l w b in B v It points  ut  that  he anges re  aligned  ery losely  ith  what  we might  discern  o  be  true rice o t r a v c w t p stability.  en  the uestion  s,  s  I  pointed  ut  yesterday, ether e really  ant  our  inflation Th q i a o wh w w target  o  be  true  rice tability  maybe true  rice tability h  a  cushion.

MR. MEYER. Right.  It s remature o  get nto hat  t his  oint,  ut  I hought  he i p t i t a t p b t t discussion  n  the luebook  was quite nteresting  d  challenging. en if  e do  not ant  to  go i B i an Ev w w back  to he  earlier  actice,  ere  ight  be  a  case  for pgrading   little  ole f he onetary t pr th m u a ther o t m aggregates  n  our eliberations.    could sk  the taff   bring o  the ommittee  information i d We a s to t C that  hey  glean rom  the onetary  aggregates  hat  hey hink ight  be  useful  o  the onetary t f m t t t m t m policy rocess.  aving  said hat,  do  not  think  here  s ecessarily  y  going  back  to he arlier p H t I t i n an t e practice.    would  only  suggest  hat  here  s n  element f ysteresis   he  monetary olicy I t t i a o h int p process. he way we view  monetary  aggregates  as  evolved  over ime  in  part ecause e have T h t b w had  to  adjust  o he nstability hose ggregates.  n  the rocess,  e began  to  give ore weight t t i of  t a I p w m to  our  ultimate jectives,    implicit flation  rget  nd  a  stabilization  ective--a  ylor ule ob an in ta a obj Ta r

We  might D t i of M y o r i q g wonder whether  we really  ant  to  go  back  to  the arlier  portance f he arget  anges ven  if w e im o t t r e M2  becomes more stable.

At  any  rate,  would concur hat  e should etain  he urrent  nterpretation    not I t w r t c i and elevate  he  role  f he onetary  aggregates.    would  not odify  the urrent  anges;    would  just t o t m I m c r I stay ith  them. w

MR. KOHN. I  think  both" s he nswer.  The models  actually   not  have  to " i t a do differentiate uch  between  supply nd  demand shocks. In  effect  hey o,  but t hould e as  s a t d i s b noted hat hey re ust  eacting  o  output aps  and  to  inflation  ps.  From the erspective  he t t a j r t g ga p oft rule,  he uler,  guess,  oes  not ave  to  say his  s   supply hock  or his  s   demand shock. t r I d h t i a s t i a Having  said hat,    would like  o ention  that  ertain  ules  ork  better  or emand shocks nd t I t m c r w f d a other ules  ork  better  or upply hocks,  s  the ther aper hat  as circulated  inted ut ore r w f s s a o p t w po o m clearly.  o,  if  ou  have  some clue s  to hether ou  are  dealing  ith  a  supply hock  or  a S y a w y w s demand shock  when making policy, u would want  to  use  that  nformation   shape  your  policy yo i to response nstead  f dhering igidly   a  particular  le. n  theory,  ou  do  not ave  to now what i o a r to ru I y h k type  of hock  it  s,  ut ou  could ake policy  etter  f  ou  did now. s i b y m b i y k

MR. MCTEER.

At  the nd  of  1996,  in  December,  the  CPI o a 2 p f o e inflation  te as 3.3  percent, d  I  think  he atest ading  s .2  percent.  t  as  come down then ra w an t l re i 2 I h on  that  railing  sis  ore than   full  ercentage  oint  t   time  when the nemployment  rate as t ba m a p p a a u h come down by  half    dozen  notches. a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I  am going  to  address  his  ssue  n  a  somewhat different t i i form.  The basic roblem  is hat  he  model  has  a  whole  series  f onsecutive  hort-term illips p t t o c s Ph curves,  nd  its  tructure es  not  change.

MR. JORDAN. Don,  I  believe  ou  provided   useful  ramework  for hinking  bout y a f t a demand side/supply de. he need  to hink bout  that  s navoidable.  e  do  that  mplicitly. si T t a i u W i So,  why not o it  xplicitly?  s ery  helpful  o  be  forced nto  hat  ramework  as  we think  bout d e Iti v t i t f a what  is oing  on and  the olicy  egime  with  which  we respond. ou say hat  he odel  does  not g p r Y t t m really  are hether  it  s ealing ith  a  supply-side   a  demand-side hock; t  esponds o utput c w i d w or s i r t o and  inflation  ps.  Of  course,  s  policymakers  e have  to are. t s mportant  or s  to  try  o ga a w c I i i f u t evaluate    shock  when it  ccurs ven  if  e cannot e  sure f  what  we mean by  demand side nd a o e w b o a supply  side.   think    know what  you  mean. Over  the ast  0  years,  e were  comfortable  n I I l 3 w i thinking  f he il vents f  1974 as  a  negative  upply hock  or  those n  1986 as  a  favorable o t o e o s s i supply  shock. But  there  re  a  lot f ther  vents hat  hock  the  economic  system uch  as a o o e t s s international elopments:  ertainly ez, he  Bay of igs,  nd  Kuwait  come to  mind.  There dev c Su t P a also re  domestic vents ike  he  Crash  of  1929,  Nixon's rice  ontrols,  d  things  ike  hat. a e l t p c an l t

I  do  not now whether ou call  hem  supply ide,  emand side,  r  what, ut  we might k y t s d o b want  to  react  ifferently  a  policy ense epending pon  which  of hose e think t s--the d in s d u t w i i nature f he  events. here  is   potential terdependence sed  on the  monetary  policy  egime o t T a in ba r that   think e have  to  be  very areful  bout. t oes  get ack  to his  uestion  f hen we may I w c a I d b t q o w want  to  exercise  aution  n he rainard ense r  the  Bill  oole  sense r  when we should orry c i t B s o P o w about  paralysis.  suspect--this nly  a  guess t  this  oint--that  the xtent  e are onfident I is o a p to e w c that  e are  dealing  nly  with  a  demand-side evelopment,  e would  lean n  the irection w o d w i d of caution.  o the  extent  e believe  e are  dealing  ith hat  starts   a  supply-side ent--it  y T w w w w as v ma be  an  asset  arket  development--then  need  to  resist  ralysis. e reason or hat  s he m we pa Th f t i t following:  e  may have  a  series  f evelopments hat  ne  might  characterize    being W o d t o as a favorable  upply-side ock  such  as  the ecent  ncrease  n  productivity--where ple erceive s sh r i i peo p that  he eal ate f eturn  n  productive  apital  ising  or   whole  host f easons.  The reason t r r o r o c isr f a o r we worry  about  a  pegged  nominal nterest  te pproach o  policy  s hat  he arket  dynamics  of i ra a t i t t m people  reacting  o he erception  f ising  eal  eturns  nd  increasing alth aise  he pportunity t t p o r r r a we r t o costs f  holding entral  ank  money. If e have  a  derived emand for entral  ank  money,  a o c b w d c b pegged  nominal  interest  te  olicy  ould  cause s  to  expand  central nk  money. This  would ra p w u ba unintentionally vert   favorable  upply-side ock  into   demand shock.  We  would  want  to con a s sh a be  a  little e activist    avoid onverting    favorable  upply hock  or  a  negative  upply hock, mor to c a s s s s say  the uwait  War,  into  n  adverse emand shock.  That  is hat  I  mean by  the nterdependency K a d w i between  the  two.

Sometimes we talk bout hose n  terms  of hat  has  happened  to  the atural  ate  f a t i w n r o interest    something imilar.   can  translate  ese hings  nto he ind  of  framework  that  e or s We th t i t k w

are  talking  bout ere.  I  think  he  analysis  f hether  we can  convert  ne kind f  shock  into he a h t o w o o t other ype  of   shock, ntentionally ot, eeds  to  be  fleshed  ut   little  re to  enable s  to t a i or  n n o a mo u guard  against  n  inadvertent tcome.  That  is ust    comment and  if  ou  want  to eact  o hat, a ou j a y r t t I would  be  glad o  hear our  thoughts  ecause  I  don't  eel hat    have  thought  t hrough s t y b f t I i t a carefully   I  need  to. as

On your  alternative  rding  for he perational ragraph f he  directive,  ike wo t o pa o t I  l getting  id f he woulds"  and  "mights" nd  all  hat. owever,  I  really  o  not ant  to  introduce r o t " a t H d w the  words  "tighten" d  "ease" nto  he irective  en  though  it  s  clear  hat  he  language efers an i t d ev i t t r to  tightening d  easing onditions   reserve  arkets.  What we are  talking  bout s xpanding an c in m a i e or  contracting ntral  ank  money. We  all  now that f  e have  a  supply-side  vent,  r  possibly ce b k i w e o a  demand-side vent ut   have  not  thought bout  that  nough,  we can  in  effect  ighten  r  ease e b I a e t o money market  conditions   reserve  onditions th  an  unchanged  fed  funds  rate.  onditions  n or c wi C i reserve  arkets an  tighten  r  ease f  e fail  o hange  the  nominal  funds  rate  ased n  the m c o i w t c b o derived emand for entral  ank  money as  modified y  external  hocks.

MR. KOHN. I  don't  hink  ave  a  lot  o  add  to hat  you said,  resident rdan.  You t Ih t w P Jo indicated at ou  might  not eact  s  strongly  o emand shocks  as  to  supply hocks,  nd  I th y r a t d s a wonder  about  that.  f  ou  really ought hat  emand had  shifted   in  the  first lf  f his  ear, I y th t d up ha o t y starting  om  a  position   which  the conomy was close  o  potential  d  was now going  past fr in e t an potential,  u  would  want  to  react  ather  trongly  hat.  n the  supply hocks,    agree ith yo r s tot O s I w

what  you  said n he  following  ense:  I  think  hey re ery  difficult  analyze.    thought ave i t s t a v to I D Stockton n  his riefing  esterday  ave  a  very  good  example  of he ind  of upply hock  you i b y g t k s s were  discussing.   that  xample  the quilibrium al unds  rate  ose ecause here as an In e e re f r b t w increase  n roductivity   he conomy,  and  at  some point he ed  would  have  to  tighten  o i p int e t F t avoid  the vershooting  n  demand that  ou  were  talking  bout.  There  could e  other  inds f o i y a b k o supply hocks.  I  think,  or xample, hat s f e t a NAIRU shock  has  a  different  avor  o  it. o,  supply fl t S shocks  do  require  ifferentiating  ee  whether hey equire  r  will ventually quire  aising d to  s t r o e re r or lowering nterest  tes  o  equilibrate  pply nd  demand in  the conomy. It s ot lways i ra t su a e i n a obvious  which  way that  s oing o  go  and  how the radeoffs ll o. Supply-side  hocks  are i g t t wi g s more difficult    analyze ecause  they ome in ifferent  rieties. to b c d va

MR. JORDAN.

I  found  the imulations   chart   of he  Bluebook  extremely s on 4 t interesting.  ould  like  o  ask  a  question  bout he pportunistic  proach o  monetary  policy  n I  w t a t o ap t i that hart.    am sure hat n  a  situation  ere  you  have  an adverse upply hock  or  a  positive c I t i wh s s demand shock  that auses   rise  n  the orecast  nflation, re  s  a  very  aggressive  eaction c a i f ofi the i r in terms  of he  opportunistic  le. f  ne  were to djust  hat  eaction  o  reflect re  realistically t ru I o a t r t mo that  olicymakers  ight  not ave  a  symmetric  objective nction  n erms  of heir  illingness p m h fu i t t w to

When  it ooks s c r l i ob v y l a though  the odel  is orecasting  creasing terest  tes,  think t  s lmost uman nature  o m f in in ra I i i a h t begin  to uestion  he orecast. at  may apply o  all he olicy  trategy  lternatives,    I  think q t f Th t t p s a but it  s ore explicit    the pportunistic  ternative. i m in o al

MR. KOHN. If ou  turn ack  to  page  10,  you  can  see hat  n  both he arget  one  and y b t i t t z the  opportunism imulations  e had  a  strong eaction   inflation  tside  he  target  one  or s w r to ou t z outside  he one  of ndifference  r pportunism. t z i fo o

MR. PARRY. r

That's  ight.

MR. KOHN. And certainly,  most y algebra, u are  right.  If  ou  reduced  those al b yo y coefficients    inflation  tside  he one  from  2.5  to  1.5, hen ou  would get   less trong on ou t z t y a s reaction, d  it ould  take onger  o  get o  price  tability. the  other  and,   think e have  to an w l t t s On h I w be  a  little  reful.  ook at he enderson-McKibbin  deliberate le.  hat  is   case  in  which  the ca L t H ru T a policymaker  oes  respond ore strongly  o  output aps  than o  inflation  ps, nd  it erforms d m t g t ga a p fairly  ell  in erms f etting  o  low  inflation.   ou  have  a  demand shock, f ourse,  here  s w t o g t Ify o c t i no  conflict. e output ap  opens  and  that  s oing  to  raise  nflation  rongly   response.  oth Th g i g i st in B are  moving  in  the ame direction.   s ith  supply hocks hat  ou get onflicts.  ,  it  s ot s Iti w s t y c So i n necessarily  e ase  that    policymaker  ho puts   lot  f mphasis  on  output  elative  nflation th c a w a o e r toi would  take   long ime  to et o rice tability.  Henderson-McKibbin  policymaker  akes a t g t p s The t less  ime  than he pportunist d  only   bit ore than he aylor olicymaker. t t o an a m t T p

MR. PARRY. I  see.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  inehan. M

MS. MINEHAN. I  am coming  from  a  different  rection,  t  I  wanted  to  make some di bu of  the ame comments. I  found  these imulations ry  interesting n  though  I  know that s s ve eve nothing an  be  carried  n  until  he  year 030  with  any  reasonable  evel  f eliability. st  say c o t 2 l o r I  mu that f  e are  going o  keep  using his  efinition   pportunism,   ould  like  o  feel   little  re i w t t d ofo Iw t a mo comfortable  bout  what  is nvolved  n  it.  great  eal f ood  material  ccompanied  the a i i A d o g a Bluebook,  and  it  s oing o  take e a  while o  digest  hat.    have  been  reasonably  ympathetic i g t m t t I s to  the dea hat  ne  reacts  hen inflation  es  above  a  boundary, ut  when inflation   ithin hat i t o w go b isw t boundary, ne  tries  o  work  harder n  the  output  ide han n  the nflation  de.   like  hat  s  a o t o s t o i si I t a theoretical  nstruct,  t 'm  not  sure hat  he ay this  s odeled  is he  same as  the ay I  am co bu I t t w i m t w thinking  bout t.   need  some time  to  assimilate at.  his iscussion s  really  elpful  nd  the a i I th T d wa h a paper as very  helpful. w

At  the isk  f eing esistant   hange  for he  sheer ake  of eing esistant    change, r o b r toc t s b r to I  must  say  that    ave  some sympathy  for on's omment about  Pandora's  ox with eference  o Ih D c b r t the roposals  o  change  the ording  of he irective. as watching he  CNN p t w t d I  w t financial commentary program  from  6:00  to  7:00  a.m  this  orning.  The  woman  who usually  oes  their m d commentary about  Fed  policy  bserved he ed's  olicy  ecision  oday  was a  "no  brainer."  he o t F p d t T really  mportant  hing as the  wording  of he  directive  om  the ay meeting,  o  be  released i t w t fr M t tomorrow,  and  whether t ould  be  symmetric  or  asymmetric.  I  thought,  h  heavens!  If  e i w o w change  this  irective rding,  t ill ake a  lot ore difference   people han e expect. e d wo i w m m to t w W don't  ecessarily  nt  to  send  new messages  with his  ording  change. n wa t w

MS. RIVLIN.  But  remember,  she  had  to  think  f omething  to ay  this  orning. o s s m [Laughter]

MS. MINEHAN. I  suppose.

That  change  would  give er  six onths'  worth  of ew material! h m n

MR.  KELLEY. MS. MINEHAN. Yes,  that's  ght. ri

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. At  least  he  said no  brainer" ther  han no  brains." s " ra t " MS. MINEHAN. Well,  that's   interpretation hat  she  actually  aid. my of  w s

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It oes  strike  e that  e have  to  go  back  to  the rawing d m w d board  on  this.  y  maximum  likelihood  timate  s hat  t ould  take s  4  hours, M es i t i w u 52 minutes,  nd a .4  seconds o  get his  ssue  esolved  oday. e  do  not  have  that  uch time. t t i r t W m

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. To change  the  wording?

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes. What we ought  to  do  is he  following: e  should t W try o  negotiate is  ssue  etween  meetings.  It s oo  difficult   egotiate rectly re. e t th i b i t ton di he W have  to igure  ut nother ay to  do  it. he  reason eople  interpret  is  irective fferently f o a w T p th d di is that  ts  onstructive  biguity as  worked.  That  is he roblem.  We  are ll ooking t  the i c am h t p a l a elephant  rom  different  rections.  ,  unless omebody disagrees  ith hat  I  am saying,  e f di So s w w w will ry hat  pproach.  I  am more than  willing  o  support  hat  is eing roposed ere. t t a t w b p h

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. I  am super ore than  willing  o  support  t. m t i MS. RIVLIN  and  MR. PARRY. Me, too.

MR. MEYER. I  have  some question  bout ow the ording  on  symmetry and a h w asymmetry  is  handled. owever,  our ractice en we set    target  or he unds  rate  f H p wh a f t f o describing  hat  n  terms f eserve  onditions ems  to  me to  be  somewhere between t i o r c se embarrassing  nd  amusing.  I  think  he ime  has  come to ake at east  hat  hange  in he a t t m l t c t directive.

MR.  PARRY. I  think  t  ould ake s  many hours f  discussion   decide hether  or i c t u o to w not  we ought  to  include    reference  o ymmetry  in  the irective. t  I  don't  nderstand  hy it a t s d Bu u w would  take s  four ours  to ake the  words  clear.  e  are erely  saying t  n nglish. u h m W m i i E

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Why  don't  e do  the  following.  his hould ot e  a w T s n b vote  of ust  he  Committee  members because  some are  on  the ommittee  and  some are ot j t C n currently,  t  the  concern s eneral.  Why  don't  e go  around  the oom and  get   quick bu i g w r a statement  rom  everyone s  to  whether r ot  they ccept he ecommendation  as  is,  r  with ery f a o n a t r o v minor  changes, r  they o  not  accept t.  We  will ind ut ery  quickly.  hy  don't  ou  start, o d i f o v W y Governor  Rivlin.

MS. RIVLIN.  I  like  he ecommended wording.  I  think  t s impler  nd  clearer. t r i i s a

MR.  KELLEY. I  would  retain  he raditional ding  until  explain  o he  public t t wor we t t how and  why we are  changing t;  he xplanation  hould e  released  n dvance  of he ctual i t e s b i a t a publication   the eworded  directive. of r

MR.  KOHN. Mr.  Chairman, t ight  be  useful  o  ask  the embers to ifferentiate i m t m d between  the  first  ntence  nd  the econd  sentence.  ome  may favor hanging ne  and  not  the se a s S c o other.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes,  I  thought  bout hat.  e  ought  not hange  one a t W c and  not  the ther  ne  until  e are  sure hat  ne  is cceptable  nd  the ther  s ot. oing  this  n o o w t o a a o i n D i two  steps  s ot  a  good  idea. 'm orry,  o ahead  President nehan. i n I s g Mi

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  arry. P

MR.  PARRY. I  like  he hanges.  When  we change  the ederal  unds  rate,  e now t c f f w announce  that  ollowing  he  meeting. o,  including  he ate  n  the irective es  not eem  to  me f t S t r i d do s to  be  much of   change. I  also ike  he larity  he lternative  rding  suggested  or ymmetry a l t c oft a wo f s and  asymmetry.  The only eservation ould have  is hat    think  erry ordan as  raised  n r I  w t I J J h a interesting  int. po

MR. HOENIG. I  would  like  o ee  clearer nguage. e  might  want  to  negotiate t s la W whether  this  s t,  ut  I hink e definitely  uld se  clearer nguage. i i b t w co u la

MR. GUYNN. I  think  he  suggested  ewording aises  nough  issues  hat  t's  t t r r e t i no worth  the rouble  t ight  bring s  if  e introduced  t  t his  ime.  I  would  leave t  lone or t i m u w i a t t i a f now.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  oehne. B

MR. BOEHNE. In  recent  ears e have  moved in  the irection  ransparency d y w d oft an clarity    terms  of aking  public hat  we do. We  debated or ears,  or xample, hether e in m w f y f e w w ought  to nnounce  our  decisions  romptly.  hink e are  much better  ff  ecause e now a p It w o b w announce  them. We  were  concerned  about hat  would  happen  if  e released  he ranscripts, w w t t and I  am not  aware  of ny  adverse esults om  our  doing hat.    think  he  proposed ewording f he a r fr t I t r o t directive  ust    continuation   our  movement toward  being ore transparent  d  clear.  ne is j a of m an O can  quibble  bout he  words  and  we don't  ecessarily  ve  to ake the roposed hanges  today, a t n ha m p c but  as  a  general  atter    think  t  ould  be  helpful  o ontinue  o  move in his  irection.  here m I i w t c t t d T are  times hen one  may want  constructive  aqueness,  ut   am in avor f he  proposed w op b I f o t rewording ecause  it oints  oward  more openness  and  transparency. b p t

MR. JORDAN. I  do  not hink his  anguage s eady or rime  time. t t l i r f p

MR. BROADDUS. Mr.  Chairman,  I  like  he ransparency pect f he  proposal  ery t t as o t v much. However,  in he  current  nvironment here  we do  not  have  a  very pecific ng-term t e w s lo goal,    worry  about he oint hat  om  Melzer  made. This  rewording s oing o  reinforce e I t p t T i g t th focus  on  the unds ate. ne other  oint hat  om  made intrigued ,  though.  If  e could  at f r O p t T me w some future  oint onsider  inking  n  that  irst ntence he  notion f "maintaining rrent"  ith p c l i f se t o cu w

an  increasing nds  rate nd  explain  hat  n  some way,  that  ight  be  a  way to  get  around he fu a t i m t problem.  But  for ow,  I  would  leave he ording  unchanged. n t w

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Meyer.

MR. MEYER. I  view  this  s  an  improvement, n  increase  n xplicitness  d a a i e an transparency.    don't  ee  any  reason hy only  professional  d  watchers hould nderstand  he I s w Fe s u t directive.  think  e have  to  bring t  nto  onformity  ith  what  we say  in ur  announcements.  I I w i i c w o also bject   little    the dea hat  he ew wording  is   problem  because t ould  tend  to o a to i t t n a i w reinforce e  notion  hat  e control  nd  move the ederal  unds  rate.  hat  is hat  we do! As th t w a f f T w long  as  that  s hat  we do, hat  s hat  we should ay  we do. i w t i w s

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Phillips.

MS. PHILLIPS.  I  am a  bit  ore comfortable  ith  the roposed irst ntence  ecause, m w p f se b as  Larry eyer said,  hat  s hat  we do.  That  is  what  we have  been  focusing  n, nd  I  think e M t i w o a w should  update hat  irective  ntence.    must  say  with espect  o he ymmetry sentence  hat t d se I r t t s t I worry  about  substituting   archaic  xpression  or nother.    also eel  hat  very  time  we vote one e f a I f t e for   given  symmetry, t  s or   different  ason. hen  we vote or   particular  mmetry at ne a i i f a re W f a sy o meeting, t  oes  not ean the  same thing s  it  oes  another  ime.  So,  I  am not  sure hat  hatever i d m a d t t w change  we make in  the ording  of hat  entence  s oing o  help  much. w t s i g t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice  Chair.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. I  think  he roposed irst ntence  erely  says t p f se m in  the irective at  we already ay  in  the ress  elease,   I  cannot ee  any  reason hy one d wh s p r so s w would  not ish  to  adopt hat  ewording. n  the urrent  econd  sentence,    find  he  "woulds"  and w t r I c s I t "mights"  to e  embarrassing  onsense.  I  think hat  ording  is he ltimate  n  obfuscation  nd b n t w t u i a

truly  illy. erefore,  nything  hat s nderstandable glish as  to  be  an  improvement, nd  I s Th a t i u En h a find he  proposed anguage o  be  just  hat.  o,  I  am happy with he roposal. t l t t S t p

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. During  the  intermeeting riod,  hy don't  e try  o pe w w t find   mechanism to  communicate  our  views  on  this  uestion  nd  bring  erhaps wo  or  three a q a p t alternatives  the ext  meeting,  ith  some sense f here  everyone  stands. n  other  ords,  let to n w o w I w us  not ust  hrow  the ssue n  the able.  e  could hen  have  a  discussion   which  hopefully  e j t i o t W t in w will each  some consensus. he issue  s ather  ricky  nd  we may end  up  agreeing, r xample, r T i r t a fo e on the  first ntence  nd  not  on  the econd. aybe we can  find    choice f ords  that  eople se a s M a o w p will upport. s

With  respect  o  the ssue f ocking  n  the unds ate,    am not  terribly  ncerned bout t i o l i f r I co a that  ecause f  e do  move away from  the  funds ate,  e will hange  the anguage.   think he b i w r w c l I t language hould eflect at  we are  doing, ut  I  do  not  see  why the ew wording  in  itself  ould s r wh b n sh be  seen  as einforcing  r  focus n  the unds  rate ny  more  than he  current  ording  does.  I r ou o f a t w cannot  see  how it  oes  that, ovided hat  e in he  Committee  recognize  hat  his  ewording s d pr t w t t t r i merely  an  endeavor  to escribe  ow we operate  nder he  current  egime.  It oes  not  prejudge d h u t r d how or  when we might  improve  the  current  egime  and  employ  new language n he  directive r i t to describe  t. f  ou go  back  and  read ome of he ery  early  irectives, y o not ook  anything i I y s t v d the d l like he  current  irectives.  e Committee  has  changed  the ording  of he irective numerable t d Th w t d in times. he directive   ot  a  constitution;  s ore like    statute d  not  a  terribly  od  one. T isn it  m i a an go Why  don't  e break  for offee? w c

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Are there ny  other uestions  or on? a q f D If ot,  et e n l m start  ff nd  go  to he irective ecifically. you  may remember,  I  indicated  hope at ur  last o a t d sp As a o meeting  that  e would have  a  credible sis  or ightening day n  the  grounds  that  he alance w ba f t to o t b of  risks  hat    saw  at hat ime,  hich  are  not aterially fferent  day,  uggested hat    very t I t t w m di to s t a gradual ise  n he  federal  unds  rate  ould  be  consistent  th hat  we knew and  what  we did r i t f w wi w not  know. In  my view  that  as the ikely  olicy  utcome,  given  our  incomplete  nowledge  at w l p o k that  ime.  However,  it  as  become quite  bvious n  the ast  everal  eeks  that  he ata o  not  yet t h o i l s w t d d make a  credible se  for ightening.  suspect  hat  uch  a  case  will  merge  by  the ime  of he ca t I t s e t t August  meeting,  ut  even  that  s ot lear  ecause  there  s omething ifferent  ing  on  in he b i n c b i s d go t economy. I  do not  know if  he ord "fundamental"  s he ppropriate rm  to  describe  t, t  we t w i t a te i bu are  observing  omething hat  s ifferent om  what  we have  experienced  ver he  years,  nd  it s s t i d fr o t a i increasingly  fficult  argue hat  e are ealing  nly ith  statistical  se r  minor  aberrations di to t w d o w noi o in  our  model  of he unctioning  he  economy. t f oft

The most  important  olicy  onsideration, ever, s hether  policy  naction  t p c how i w i a this  ime  would  put s  behind he  curve. hat is eassuring  hat  e are  hard  pressed  o  find t u t W r ist w t any  evidence f ising  nflationary ssures  n he  data,  hether  we are  looking,  or xample, t o r i pre i t w f e a the  pipeline mbers  or  at he age structure. erever  we look,  e are etting  ittle,  ny, nu t w Wh w g l ifa evidence f ounting  inflationary ssures, d  that  as  to aise  ome questions  bout ow we o m pre an h r s a h view  the conomy at  large.   recently  lanced hrough he  Beigebook  of bout  18 months  ago, e I g t t a and  it  eemed  to e that    could ake ts  over ff nd  replace  t  ith  the over or he atest s m I t i c o a i w c f t l Beigebook. That  may seem a  bit  hallow nalytically,    if  e think bout t,  his  s elling s a but w a i t i t us something  quite mportant. i

It s ard  at his  tage o  look  at he rrors  roduced y  our  equations  nd i h t s t t e p b a conclude hat  hey eflect e sual tatistical  se. he evidence o  longer uggests  n y t t r th u s noi T n s i m opinion hat  hat  s   credible  iew.  We  tend o  construct,    either  formal  or  a  less  ormal t t i a v t in a f manner,  some econometric tructure at eflects  e ay we think he  economy works.

MR. MEYER. Mr.  Chairman,  I  agree  with our olicy  ecommendation  for oday. y p r t I want  to  spend  a  few  minutes alking out  policy  n   somewhat longer-range rspective. t ab i a pe I think  ur  semiannual wo-day  pre-Humphrey-Hawkins  meetings ive  us  the  opportunity  ake o t g tot that  roader erspective  monetary  policy.  o take dvantage f hat,  want  to  talk  bout  the b p on T a o t I a policy  hat    think  ould  be  appropriate er he emainder f he  year. his  in  no  way binds e t I w ov t r o t T m with  respect  o  future  olicy  ecisions,    my prescription  ll lways  respond o  unexpected t p d as wi a t developments  in  the ata nd  associated anges  in  my forecast. d a ch

Based on  my current  ssessment  f he  outlook,  hich  is ery  similar   that  f he a o t w v to o t Greenbook  in erms  of he ath or he  unemployment  rate--growth  ell  above  trend n he t t p f t isw i t second  half  f he  year nd  the nemployment  rate  eclines  urther--I ieve  hat  e should lan o t a u d f bel t w p to  raise  he unds ate  y  50  basis  oints  ver he emainder f he  year n wo 25  basis  oint t f r b p o t r o t i t p increments, e in  August  or  September  and  the ther  n ovember  or  December. I  would, n on o i N i effect,   pushing orward o  the  second  half  f 997 the ncreases  n  the econd  half  f  1998 be f t o 1 i i s o that  re ncorporated   the  Greenbook  forecast.  think uch  a  path ould  put s  in  a  better a i in I s w u position  o  limit  he ncrease  n nflation  ojected er  1998 and  especially  to 999  as  well s t t i i i pr ov in 1 a reduce  the isk  f   still arper  ncrease  n nflation  an s rojected   the reenbook. I  might r o a sh i i i th i p in G also ote  that  he nvironment n  the  second  half,  east  s  projected,  ovides  n  unusually n t e i atl a pr a

I  view  this  ecommendation  as  consistent th  the ong-run imulations esented  n r wi l s pr i the  Bluebook.  The  most  important  onclusion  hat    reach rom  those imulations  hat,  ven c t I f s ist e given  the ery  optimistic sessment f he  inflation  tlook  n  the  base  forecast,  netary v as o t ou i mo policy  eeds  to ilt  ward  greater straint    prevent  n  increase  n  consumer  price  nflation n t to re to a i i over  time  to bove  3 percent.  he second  conclusion, rhaps ore  implicit an  explicit, hat a T pe m h ist putting  ome restraint    place n  the ear erm  enhances  the rospect  hat  ny  required  estraint s in i n t p t a r will e  modest, ill e  imposed  gradually, d  can  be  done  without hreatening  recession. b w b an t a I think he  simulations th  alternative  licy  ules  einforce is  ecommendation.

I  interpreted  r  decision  o  hold olicy teady t he ast  eeting  as  reflecting esire ou t p s a t l m a  d to  move gradually  nd  to  postpone urther ghtening til  here as clearer  vidence f  a a f ti un t w e o rebound  in  demand following  he  slowdown in  the  second  quarter.  he data ince he ast t T s t l meeting  do  not et learly  ignal  hat  hat  xpected ebound  is nder ay.

Both  of hem discussed  he eed  to  be  forward-looking th  monetary  policy,  iven he t t n wi g t long  lags hat  re  involved  nd  the act  hat  e have  to ely n  forecasts   a  result. th  of t a a f t w r o as Bo them,  particularly today, oted  a  sense f isconnect  etween  the heory nvolved n ost  of Ed n o d b t i i m our  forecasts d  the eality   what  we see  in erms f   highly  ompetitive  usiness an r of t o a c b environment  and  a  commitment within hat  nvironment o  stable,   ot eclining, ices  ven  in t e t if n d pr e the  face f ather  ight  abor  nd  other apacity  onstraints.  gree ith  that.  e  have  seen  the o r t l a c c I  a w W same process n  our  own District,   I  have  heard  a  million  necdotes  bout ost-cutting  d i and a a c an productivity  provements.  There  really es  seem  to  be  a  new environment ut  there. im do o

However,  it  eems to e that  hile  theory nd  reality  n  be  slightly  vergent   the s m w a ca di in real conomy at  present, e ame may be  true n  the  financial rkets,  nly  in he pposite e th s i ma o t o direction.   the  financial  rkets,  heory uggests  hat  eal nterest  tes  re  high  by  historical In ma t s t r i ra a standards.  owever,  we have  the eality  ooming capital rkets,  normous liquidity, H r ofb ma e and incipient  al  state  ooms that  eople ll  round  the able  entioned  in  our  discussion re e b p a a t m yesterday.  t s rue hat  ome staff terial  e received  esterday  ith   salmon-colored  over I i t t s ma w y w a c suggested  hat t  s  difficult  find vidence f   real  state  oom nationally. t, e certainly t i i to e o a e b Bu w

do  see  it  n  oston.  Current onditions   the inancial  rkets  and  apparently  tarting    emerge i B c in f ma s to in  the eal  state  arkets ay  to e that  eal nterest  tes  n eality e ot igh,  nd  that r e m s m r i ra i r ar n h a monetary  policy  t his  oint  ay be  a  bit  oo ccommodative  for hose inds f arkets.  I  do a t p m t a t k o m not  believe  hat  onetary  policy  ught o e  used  to educe tock arket  prices  r  asset  rices, t m o t b r s m o p but  I  do  think  e run  the isk  hat  he bullience  have  today n  financial rkets ill low w r t t e we i ma w f over  into  eal state rkets  and  even  increase  he ense f ealth hat  onsumers  and  businesses r e ma t s o w t c now have.

This  is here  the oom/bust  scenario  hat    mentioned  yesterday  omes in.  We  all w b t I c know what  happens  when asset  ubbles ccur n  financial  d  real  state  arkets. e  saw that b o i an e m W in  the ate 980s  in his  ountry;  e saw it  n  Japan  as  well. eople egin o elieve  hat  he l 1 t c w i P b t b t t prices  f heir  ssets  an  only o  up.  Banks  begin  lending  or ny  project,  able  r  not. o t a c g f a vi o Everyone  who can  pick p  a  hammer becomes  a  construction  rker,  nd  all f his  eeds ack u wo a o t f b into  he conomy in  the orm  of ncreasing essures d  rising  rices.    think  he oom is t e f i pr an p I t b inevitably llowed y a  bust nd  the  anecdotal  vidence uggests  he igger he  boom,  the fo b a e s t b t bigger  he  bust. t

There  is o  question  hat  ur  economy right  ow is bout s  good  as  it  ets. s n t o n a a g A President  oehne and  others  ave  pointed ut,  e should e  very  pleased  bout hat, d  I  think B h o w b a t an there  s ood  reason or aiting nd  seeing ight  ow. But  with  strong  ontinuing  orward i g f w a r n c f momentum  in  economic  activity,  ght bor  arkets,  nd  indications   ncipient   ot  fully ti la m a ofi if n realized  sset  ubbles,    think  here  re eal anger igns. ou have  mentioned, r.  Chairman, a b I t a r d s Y M the  need  over he ear erm  to hink bout  tightening netary  policy.    am very uch in t n t t a mo I m agreement  with hat.    wanted  to  interject  is  ote  f aution  rom  the inancial    opposed  to t I th n o c f f as

the  real ide f he  economy,  but   am,  as  I  said,  n  favor f our  recommendation  at  this s o t I i o y meeting.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Phillips.

MS. PHILLIPS.  I  agree  with  "B" asymmetric.  Since nflation  d  pipeline  nflation i an i look  pretty  enign,  t eems  to  me that  here  s ime o  see  whether he conomy will low  to  a b i s t i t t t e s more sustainable owth  rate. ith  regard o  symmetry,  since here  s ore likelihood at  e gr W t t i m th w are  going  to ighten  han o  ease nd  since e adopted  an  asymmetric  directive   he  last t t t a w att meeting,   think he  asymmetry  should e  continued. hould  we tighten  n  August  or  early  all, I t b S i f we would look  rather  oolish  f  e had  just  emoved  the ias.   continue  o elieve  hat  e will f i w r b I t b t w have  to ighten  n iew  of he trong  abor  nd  equity arkets,  ut t  oes  seem to  me that  here t i v t s l a m b i d t is  time o et  he  situation  velop   bit. t  5-1/2 ercent, e  federal  unds ate  ay not  be  that t l t de a A p th f r m far ut  of lignment,  articularly  long ates  ave  come down.

How  do  we make any  rationale  at  e have  credible   the rray f th w to a o audiences hat  e have  out here?

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  oskow. M

MR. MOSKOW. Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  he conomy is perating  eyond  its  otential t e o b p and  that e will ave  to ncrease  nterest  tes  ventually. t  I  also gree hat e do  not  see w h i i ra e Bu a t w any  early  vidence,  ertainly    credible  vidence,  f age and  price  cceleration    this  oint. e c no e o w a at p So,  I  gree hat  e should ait or ow. a t w w f n

That  is c T on t a

something  we have  to  be  very areful  bout  and  very oncerned bout,  ut  for ow I  agree ith c a c a b n w your  recommendation  of  a  "B" asymmetric  directive.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  cTeer. M MR. MCTEER. I  agree ith  your  recommendation. w CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  roaddus. B

MR. BROADDUS. Mr.  Chairman,  we have  had  a  lot f avorable  eports  ver he o f r o t period ince he ast  eeting,  nd  like  verybody  else    am encouraged y  them.  At  the  same s t l m a e I b time, s  Cathy  Minehan emphasized  very  appropriately, need  to  keep  our  perspective. e a we Th level  f conomic activity   till ry  high.  Labor  markets, f  nything,  re  tighter an hey o e iss ve i a a th t were at he  time f  our  last  eeting.  The  data uggesting  hat  ggregate  emand is oftening t o m s t a d s may reflect  mporary ather  han ermanent  developments;  e just  on't  now.  Certainly,  e te r t p w d k th fundamentals  eem to  be  in  place or   reacceleration   onsumer  spending n he hird  uarter. s f a ofc i t t q This  is n  expansion n  which  on a  number of ccasions  e have  seen  a  weak quarter  ollowed a i o w f by a  resurgence  n  the ollowing  uarter. i f q

With respect  o he  structure  he  economy,  I  certainly pe  you are  right  hat  t  s t t oft ho t i i changing  in  a  way that  an  help s  in onducting onetary  policy.  ut  we just  o  not now that, c u c m B d k as  Jerry  ordan aid.   think  e have  to e  careful  nd  cautious  bout umping  to  any  unduly J s I w b a a j firm onclusions  n  that  egard.  ave  tried  o alance hese onsiderations  best   can.  If  t c i r Ih t b t c as I i were  up  to  me,  I  ould still  efer  o  take ut ome insurance  ow mainly ecause t  eems  to w pr t o s n b i s me,  in  line  ith hat  Tom  Melzer  was saying arlier,  at  he isk  f aking  ut  that  nsurance  s w w e th t r o t o i i less  n  balance han he isk f ot  taking  t ut.  I  also ould  make the oint hat    small ove o t t r o n i o w p t a m would  not e  a  tightening  onetary  policy.  hat  goes  back  to  some things  hat    said arlier. b ofm T t I e

I  believe  hat  e do  have  a  rationale r oving today,  ut  I  do  not hink  t  s   rationale  at  he t w fo m b t i i a th t public  s eady  to ccept. e  need  to  do  a  better b f reparing  he ublic  o  accept t. t  the i r a W jo o p t p t i A same time, he  recent  ews  is ncouraging.    feel  t  least    little  re  comfortable  han   did  at t n e I a a mo t I the  last  eeting.  I  can  support  our  recommendation, r.  Chairman, ut   would  definitely  nt m y M b I wa an  asymmetric  directive.
