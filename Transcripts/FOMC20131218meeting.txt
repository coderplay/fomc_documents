Yes.  I just want to ask a couple learned and what we are control market interest rates with this facility?  You've observations with negative spreads.  What do you know about that?

The Lucas critique is massive for that demand curve.  This is a demand capped at $1 billion.  The full allotment idea would be a environment for them to be in, in terms of the bargaining power that they would In addition, it is clear that many of them, as Lorie pointed out, are unprepared to counterparties, because even though 5 basis points is relatively high with the 1 basis point with which we started, 5 basis points on $1 billion for a day is compared with the counterparty relationships.

There are aspects of have been trading quite a bit below the 5 basis points, that is not clear to us right now.  What we would like to be able to do is learn more in this sort of practice stage with what this facility offers, whether we have to offer it later firmer floor, whether the market participants have said they would like are we going to learn more by extending the allotment to $3 billion? are we going to get another chart like this and hear you say that we are not going to learn MR.

are talking about compared to the reserves that have been added just over the last month allotment, it will be hard for us to estimate some of that.  The quantities we now are relatively small or so.

LACKER. In light of that, you are asking for an extension for another month. MR.

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Not right now.  Not today.

right now. MR. POTTER.  No, we're just asking for an increase in the cap by some measure?  You are asking for an extension.  Is MR. LACKER.  All right.  We are going to expand the experiment.  Are we going to expand the experiment every meeting there a longer-run plan for these experiments?

analysis that was contained in the staff memo was trying to think consequences of running this exercise without a terminal date; the Committee could any point to stop the exercise.  But instead of having this date of January 29 stuck in we have now, you wouldn't have that.  Similar to the operational testing. MR. POTTER.

you just said that we are not going to learn much until that experiment MR. LACKER.  Okay, because people are confident this is going to be around a while.  But we are not doing yet.

going to learn more about the high level of operational flow complete, and the clearing banks can complete.  We should have closer to $30 billion MR. POTTER.  Well, we are that we can

to get that last feeling of completion on the to $40 billion, on average, which would allow us operational aspect.

interest rates are really low until 2019.  Do you think you will enough experimenting by then?  I mean, is there some time when you are going to sort MR. LACKER.  Let's say have done of say, 'We know enough and we can put it on the shelf and then we'll have it for when we want to raise rates'?

what the FOMC decides to do, yes. MR. POTTER.  If that's your process of inquiry.  When are you going to know by another $2 billion'? MR. LACKER.  I'm asking about enough to be able to say, 'We don't want to do more experiments, and we don't need to raise the cap

We can learn a limited amount over this intermeeting period.  The off the caps, or if it wants to hold off on that.  And that will be a decision My feeling is that the staff recommendation, particularly would like to understand more about how this would affect money in place. MR. POTTER. FOMC will have to decide in January whether it wants to learn quite a lot more, which it could do by moving to taking that the Committee makes in January. the Desk one, is that we markets without the caps comfortable I had a more definite sense of what you were you were about to learn with the next incremental expansion of the experiment. MR. LACKER.  I would like to understand more, too.  I would feel more supporting this if there was a long-range plan and learning or what

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think the question is, what's the value of that additional separation of time, in your opinion?  That's really the question.

LOGAN.  We've done a series of technical announcements related to small-value participants seem to understand that these MS. tests, and they have been very successful.  Market actions and these Desk statements are technical in nature.

some CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let's ask you to look into that unless there's important technical barrier.  Do it Friday morning then?

LOGAN. Yes, we can do it Friday morning. MS.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser?

just want to make a broader observation.  I find this experiment I think it's potentially very important going forward for the Committee to the operating environment in which we would want to work.  I think haven't really talked about that a whole lot.  I would think that in experiments, this Committee ought to be talking about the consequences of and the models for operating environments that we would like to see.  This we need to have a discussion here about the MR. PLOSSER.  Yes.  I very interesting, and think about the nature of that's important.  But we parallel with these the experiments would bear on which ones we would choose, but

December 17-18, 2013

going back to the funds rate or going back to a repo I think we ought to get that on the table for discussion with the Committee as a whole. tradeoffs of different strategies, whether it be rate. That's really my only point.

Yellen. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor to look at role a facility like this could play, at least in our medium-term operating environment. have a very large balance sheet for a very long time regardless of what MS. YELLEN.  I very much agree with that suggestion and think we ought what After all, we're going to the end state of our operating regime looks like, and I think there are a whole bunch of questions we need to consider around this.

absolutely need to assure ourselves that this would work to set a go to full allotment.  And, when you think about it, if we end up beginning to reduce going to begin to ask questions about our exit strategy again and have raised our funds rate target?  Well, we can't really comfortably going to work. First of all, I think we floor if we our asset purchases, people are about all of the things we have left unspecified.  Are we going to keep our balance sheet at its current size until after we do that unless we know that this facility is are also very important questions about the fed funds rate when we go to full market become dysfunctional, which could mean that we're going to need to or market participants use the fed funds rate as I just want to say, I really endorse the notion that we have to look very seriously at or longer-term issues. There allotment, especially if we narrow the gap between the IOER and this rate.  The funds could begin to dry up or want to move to a different rate that's our target rate which is, at a minimum in terms of communications, a big step, I think.  And given that a reference rate in a lot of contracts, we need to consider what happens if it starts to become idiosyncratic. these medium-

December 17-18, 2013

with all of that.  One of the things I wanted to do was to get that I'm worried about is-and you alluded to this, a choice of whether we I meant. MR. PLOSSER.  I agree discussion started in this group because what Janet-that if we continue to push on the experiment, we may find ourselves in a spot where the funds market actually has dried up to the point where we may not have want to restore it or not.  And if so, I don't want to back us into a corner before we make some more positive decisions about what it is we'd like to be able to achieve through all this.  That's really all

I think we should look at it, I'm thinking about MS. YELLEN.  I agree, and when I say sooner rather than later-namely, within the next couple of meetings, probably, as opposed to, oh, let's wait a year or so.

MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you.

Let me explain the complicated choreography we have here. We have five presentations:  Stacey Tevlin, Trevor Reeve, and Nellie economic situation and financial stability; Weinbach on the SEP submissions and the survey on the cost and efficacy respectively.

All right.  I'll remind you later.  Let me call now on Stacey. After hearing all of those five submissions, we'd like to take questions on the last two, on the surveys, so that these two folks can exchange places and have Bill English and Simon back at the table.  And then we'll take questions on the economic and financial issues, if everyone followed all of that.  [Laughter]

As shown by the black line in the topleft panel, we continue to expect that GDP growth will accelerate over the next Compared with what we projection for GDP growth is just a shade weaker, on average, through 2015.  As indicated by the shaded area and as described in a revisions of this size are modest compared but it may still be informative to discuss the reasons we have downgraded our assessment of the economy over this period.  Some of the reasons are noted to the right.  Slightly higher interest rates (shown in the a small role in our downward revisions.

As shown in the bottom-left panel, since the June Tealbook, we have trimmed our estimate of PCE growth this account the recent upward revision to the current quarter.  As

you can see by the 2014 bars in this panel, we are the FOMC in October, we have several hypotheses for why consumer spending increases were subdued, but the evidence to distinguish among these theories is not conclusive.  Nonetheless, as assuming that at least some of that weakness will persist into next year.

This reading, in conjunction with the PPI for November, which was released on Friday, points to little revision to our (the memo line in the table) and led to no material changes in our inflation outlook since we published the December Tealbook last week.

As shown by the black line in the top-left panel, after having slowed some during the summer, total payroll employment rose at a pace of nearly 200,000 per month over the past three months, substantially more than we had anticipated in October.  In addition, as shown in the inset box, the unemployment rate has stepped down about ¼ percentage point since the summer 7 percent in November.

This series we would expect if it is capturing the recent increase in nonparticipation is shown by the red and report they do The labor force participation rate, which is shown in the inset box in the top-right panel, has also moved down in recent months.  However, we are not inclined to interpret much of this decline as signaling that people are Some evidence for this view is shown by the black line in this panel, which shows the share of people who are moved up noticeably during the recession-as discouragement-but after that drifted up only a little further.  Perhaps more surprisingly, in the past few months it has turned back down sharply.

Turning to your next exhibit, adding to concerns about the euro area is that inflation, the black line in the first panel, has fallen below 1 percent, prompting fears of deflation.  Inflation in other advanced economies, except for Japan, has also fallen. In our view, however, these declines in inflation are well energy prices, the fading slack.  Thus, we do not see these inflation expectations generally remain well and slack diminishes, we expect inflation to edge keep accommodative for the next several years.

That said, from a longer-term perspective, the large cumulative inflows to the longer-term bond funds since 2009 suggest investors may still be significantly exposed to interest rate risk.

The first row of the table responses for marginal costs (column D), noting that highly accommodative policies provide an incentive for risktaking.  As shown in column C, you were nearly as concerned about the potential costs of capital losses to the Federal Reserve.  You noted that such losses, or the associated lack of remittances to the Treasury, could result in increased political scrutiny of the Federal Reserve's operations and therefore pose and independence, and so to its ability to achieve difficulty in managing the Federal Reserve's lack of experience in managing exit from the current unconventional policy stance.  Some also noted that financial markets could exhibit unexpected responses to steps taken to remove policy Committee's experience your most frequent responses to the generally increase with the size of the balance sheet, but you held about how rapidly each cost was increasing and about the time frame cost was expected to manifest itself (row 4), ranging from any time years from now.  When asked how each cost might be ending the purchase program (row 5), some of you offered example, to reduce the risks associated with incurring capital exit (column E), some of you for exit. The remainder of the table summarizes qualitative questions about each category of costs.  As shown in rows 2 and 3, most of you said that costs differing views over which each now to a number of ameliorated other than by ideas for how to do so while others said that stopping purchases was the most effective option.

Thank you.  That concludes our presentations.

I suggested before, we would and Gretchen about their survey reports.  Are there any survey?  President Evans. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  As like to start with questions for Marnie questions on the SEP or on the costs and efficacy a quick question on the SEP policy statement relied on the outlook coming that our SEP was stronger than they were risk from these SEP projections that the market is going to be generate any potential increase?  I'm trying to guess what type by itself. MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have projections.  I think it was back in June when our out of the SEP, and I think the market reaction was expecting.  Is there any unexpectedly higher or lower or of effect it might have on long-term interest rates

December 17-18, 2013

you two pieces of information that might help answer effect, which the staff the median that the fed funds rate at the end of 2015 and 2016 is 25 basis points MS. DeBOER.  Sure.  I can give that question.  The fed funds rate implied by overnight index swaps right now is about 40 basis points lower than the SEP implied rate at the end of 2015 and about 40 basis points below in 2016 as well.  These quotes have not been adjusted for any term premium believes is negative, so the difference from the SEP could be higher than is indicated by the unadjusted market quotes.  Another piece of information I could bring to bear is: primary dealer thought below where the SEP puts it.  So there is a chance that the market could interpret the SEP as more hawkish than it feels itself to be.

rate, are those forecasts pretty much in line with what market participants would MR. EVANS.  Okay.  That's helpful.  But in terms of the GDP projection and the unemployment expect us to have coming out of the meeting?

For the unemployment rate, we are very close to where the primary a little bit more MS. DeBOER. dealer survey is.  At the end of 2015, we're within 1 basis point.  The SEP is optimistic in 2016.

costs.  I want to drill down a little bit on the financial instability part. going to offer a comment and see if I misunderstood some of the responses. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  A question for Gretchen about the survey results regarding I'm yield curve, as opposed, necessarily, to the level effects per flow of purchases might push upward on longer-term yields, It seemed to be that people perceived the financial instability consequences of our policy as being tied to the steepening of the se.  So, for example, reducing the

That would induce That seemed to be the main source of financial instability that people were I missed something, and I would be interested in your perspectives on it. whereas our fed funds rate policy is keeping financial instability. identifying, but maybe about how it would mechanism by which it would become manifest.  People did comment and about the policies could possibly lead to some some manifestation in particular markets. MS. WEINBACH.  I think that's right.  There was a range of views become manifest and the on that configuration, but some also commented on the basket of unusual policies now, including not just rates but purchases as well, and how the Fed's steps to exit from the unusual stance to manage the unusual policies and communicate swings in rates that are unexpected or could lead to

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thanks. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.

could lead to VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Wasn't there also a view that the policies asset overvaluation and those-

That's right.  That's what I mean by some particular markets may get There was a wide range of views. MS. WEINBACH. overvalued-yes.

I was hoping that the survey would be revelatory about asset purchase tool that don't necessarily apply to the fed funds rate tool, I didn't see that clearly you are worried about steepening the yield curve, that actually is a force that ties the two a little closer together as opposed to one that separates them, because you don't want to be MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes. costs that apply to our with the idea that that would be helpful in communicating to the public about why we are taking steps with respect to one that we weren't taking with respect to the other. identified in the financial instability part of this survey.  In fact, the opposite could be said to be true.  If tools

And there were possible that there will be, as we get to tapering get closer to exit, kind of a snapback in term premiums, an abrupt run-up in long rates relative to just accommodative policy. MR. ENGLISH.  I read the comments that people were just worried worried about purchases different stories there, but at least one was we are pushing down term premiums to push down long-term rates.  We don't really know a lot about how that will work out over time, just because of a lack of experience with the tool.  And it is and as we that could cause problems that would be difficult to manage.  I think that was the extra thought that stuck in my mind for purchases

could manifest itself.  Some saw it in terms of calendar time, just this for a long time, and Fed action, taking steps or communicating about MS. WEINBACH.  I think that was evident as well in the responses about the time over which financial instability low interest rate environment and the policies in general being in place others framed that realization in terms of a exiting or tapering.

Tarullo. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions?  Governor you, Mr. Chairman.  I hesitate to ask this, Marnie, but for FOMC? MR. TARULLO.  Thank internal purposes, did you determine what the distribution of liftoff and interest rates at the end of 2015 and 2016 would be based on voting members of the

are providing guidance to would be at whether they thought the threshold was inappropriate.  And similar to know exactly why people are picking that liftoff economy is, or is it tied to other factors?  It just seems like it is MR. ROSENGREN.  I have a question on the SEP, too, that is related to Governor Tarullo's question.  We lay out the liftoff tied to calendar date, but we the public tied to the unemployment rate.  Do you think it's confusing to have an SEP based on calendar time?  And do you think there would be any value to actually having it more tied to the thresholds that we are using in the forward guidance?  When I look at, for example, 2014, I don't know if those two individuals thought liftoff would occur because they thought we 6½ percent or lower, or what Governor Tarullo was suggesting, I don't date-is it tied to how strong the a little bit at variance with our forward guidance to be so focused on calendar dates.

In previous SEP briefings there has been a scatter plot that indicates what of inflation and the unemployment rate will be at the time of liftoff.  It is not your briefing this time.  That is one of the pieces of information that is presented to you were to show that scatter plot to you in December think that the unemployment rate will be at the time of liftoff than you did in September. MS. DeBOER. participants' views included in the Committee but not presented to the public right now.  If the public, it would show that more of at or below 6 percent financial stability.  Any questions for our CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions?  [No response]  Okay.  Thank you.  Now we can turn to questions about the economic outlook or colleagues?  President Kocherlakota.

I think liquidity risk is on that list, only because this is a time large inflows to long-term funds.  Small banks have moved into longer-terms assets. companies have moved into longer-term assets. and it is temporary and goes away, but there is more uncertainty around that, so that's why we put

Maybe you can help me with municipals.  This probably was could such a shock be in the MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. in the report, and I just didn't read it carefully enough.  How big municipal market in terms of magnitudes?

LIANG.  Puerto Rico itself is the eighth or ninth largest bond issuer, $70 billion.  It it is not trivial.  The municipal bond market is about $2½ trillion to $3 trillion. and the low rates.

it the risk to creditor losses, is it the leveraged economies?  What are their larger MR. EVANS.  On the municipal market, is losses somehow embedded in this, or is it the fact that the municipalities themselves will be so challenged that that could have some effect on their vulnerabilities?

Kocherlakota asked about economic risks.  And so this is more costs for municipalities to raise funds, because we think the investors are not exposures.  There are a couple, of course.  It is I do think it would raise the cost of funds for MS. LIANG.  President about raising levered particularly.  Banks do not have big mostly high-net-worth individuals, but municipalities.

LIANG.  Yes.  We have not worked through that whole analysis. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  And that would force them to cut back on employment. MS. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.

want to suggest, Nellie, that you might want to go back and look at New Supply System.  And even advanced and the use of municipals for collateral purposes is much case studies to get your arms wrapped MR. FISHER.  I York City from the 1970s, and also the Washington Public Power though the markets have further advanced than it was before, you might look at around this.

New York City, banks held a lot of municipal have reduced their of the issues related to financial stability per se. MS. LIANG.  That's right.  At the time of bonds.  But they no longer do.  They don't get the tax benefit of it, so they holdings.  I think that has removed some as well, because that was 5 percent.

MR. FISHER.  And you might look at the WPPSS CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Other questions?  President Bullard.

you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to refer to exhibit 11, the forward the S&amp;P 500 forward I think is one many of us have told, historical valuations.  But the red line here good.  How should I interpret this line, and how should I think about this? MR. BULLARD.  Thank price-to-earnings ratio, which is the upper left-hand panel.  This shows price-to-earnings ratio, and the black line tells a story that which is, it doesn't look too out of line compared with doesn't look as the small-cap, is based on the median you can see, those have risen, and they are a little bit closer to the aggregate earnings, because many firms have projected very small-caps are a little hard to capture.  That's why we pick a median, so the way those things break down.  We were got some P/Es-where you MS. LIANG.  That's right.  The red line, which is firm in the Russell 2000.  As top end of the range.  We don't use negative earnings, so the we miss some of the variation because of highlighting the rise, and along with that, that there are some stocks now that seem to have pretty high valuation ratios.  Prices have been rising 80 percent, and we've

MR. BULLARD.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions?  President Fisher.

ask a couple of Nellie. MR. FISHER.  I just wanted to make an observation for Trevor and then questions exhibit 7, you made the differentiation between Brazil and Indonesia, on and Korea, on the other.  It may be that some countries have taken Trevor, in your the one hand, and Mexico

December 17-18, 2013

interest rates and relatively inexpensive capital to achieve change.  We've certainly seen that in Mexico, and I would argue we've seen some of Brazil and made structural changes, but rather financed Batista in Brazil is a model of wasted effort and excessive leverage.  So I you might consider that.  That's one of the reasons you've seen this advantage of this long period of low structural that in Korea, even though it's further advanced than most other EMs.  Whereas Indonesia, and I would add India, have not consumption.  Eike would just suggest that disparity.

agree with that, and the recent structural reforms in Mexico have been MR. REEVE.  I quite impressive.

glad you included the equity margin in exhibit 11. line is pretty daunting.  I'm not sure exactly what it means, but by my numbers, year over year.

In terms of loan bond funds, we'd seen net inflows for 77 I'm hearing in the marketplace, they're increasingly backed by of a lot of these leveraged loans and the quality of these overall been deteriorating.

I think the loans, meaning $50 million or more, and the distribution of those loans The red portion of the bars shows that the multiples greater than 6 have been increasing this That would be consistent.  And then, of course, we've been hearing about looser terms, other

December 17-18, 2013

going SNC exams and the MRAs.  Some of what we see here in the third quarter are the riskier part of the kinds of terms, changes in covenants and that kind of thing that could make the loans weaker.  I think that is consistent.  The supervisors, based on the guidance that was issued, have been out and doing the deals that were already in the pipeline, and there is some expectation that business will contract.

earnings, and a lot of what's driving earnings is the restructuring through earnings directly.  It's not being driven by top line, in other words; it is driven financial engineering.  I think we need to keep that in mind.  The only reason I raise this consequences of accommodative monetary policy that I think we just of some of what we the point I wish to make. MR. FISHER.  And then last, to President Bullard's point, Mr. Chairman, we also have to look at what's driving borrowing money, buying back shares, and paying out dividends.  The buybacks of shares, of course, affect more by question is that these are need to be aware of.  I'm not criticizing.  I'm just saying it's an end result do, that's

I had a two-hander from the Vice Chairman. MR. FISHER.  I think the greatest concern is the lack of top-line growth. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.

December 17-18, 2013

covenants get loosened, that that's a bad thing.  But I've talked to a number of who have suggested another explanation:  that the investors, if they don't value yield and looser covenants, recognizing that the What's the staff assessment on that? VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes.  I had a question about covenants.  There is a perception that as people covenants, would prefer to have a higher covenant doesn't really have value to them.

it is mixed.  The institutional part of the loans is going to the covenants, and to the a problem.  I think it's a MS. LIANG.  I would say pension funds and insurance companies, who don't value the covenants.  Many of these are maintenance covenants.  I think banks, though, do still value some of these extent they're losing them on the revolver piece, that's potentially mixed bag.

I wanted to make. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think it's a more nuanced story than how it's normally told.  That's the only point

MS. LIANG.  That's right.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

I commentary about that, and that's what's driving it.  I'd be surprised if they put much weight on the buyback as driving earnings, and this is a standard practice, I'll walk through some numbers during my presentation.  They're pretty large MR. FISHER.  I think it's a combination of both.  They're driving down their SG&amp;A expenses dramatically, but they're also engineering their by the way.

Now, is the lower path of MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have On The December that in our June FOMC statement we took note of the fact that inflation was we said that we think there are transitory reasons inflation in part due to more persistence of those transitory influences, or is there something else going on?

It's not because of more persistence of the transitory influences that we One of the big things we reported at that time was how medical really has any going to repeat.  The most important reason we revised down the two-tenths has to do with news that we learned at the time of the revision during the summer.  At that time, we learned that the BEA had revised all through history, and the procedure suggested that BEA will continue going forward.  And we marked down our forecast a tenth MS.

How are we supposed to think about that if your target is still that you want total PCE inflation to be you will support the economy until it reaches 2 percent even by this new MS. TEVLIN.

I components catch up to the changes in inflation.  I was kind of driving toward-it is transitory now, and then when it some time to figure out how all of this is going to make its way into inflation adjustments there is some downward headwind for inflation that we should be worried about.  But it is hard to assess that.

My other question is about the other advanced foreign In exhibit 7, it's the case that most of these countries have lower an environment where their policy rates are going to be moving up.  Maybe you mentioned on this.  Is it the pull of inflation back up to target?

And this also seemed to be you could add a little more color to the few sentences that longer-term inflation expectations that is bringing more tangible than that? But

I mentioned, a big part of the deceleration inflation across these economies has been declines in energy prices.  And the deceleration has greater extent than the declines in prices, say, of crude oil, because there has compression of refining margins globally throughout this period.  And that in our MR. REEVE.  Sure.  On the latter point, I would categorize that triple dip as pretty much just a risk and not part of the baseline projection.  As in continued even to a also been a

That is throughout the forecast period, but it is projected to diminish going forward.  And those are sort of the main influences operating here.

MR. EVANS.  Fair enough.

We do have the Phillips curve operable in this forecast, but we think the gap closing over gradual.  And then on top of that, for at least the next years, we have energy prices declining.  And with energy prices declining, they are kind of from slack.  That at least gets us through the next few MS. TEVLIN.

We use the term 'uncertainty' a lot, and the cone is like that.  The cone is around your forecast, isn't it?

Given their assessment and given the projected slow rate of progress toward our dual mandate conclusion is that financial stability monetary policy.  But Book B.  We should anticipate that the economy continues to improve.  This conclusion means that the Committee will need to do even systematic fashion.

So that's the first step:  to try to focus our attention materially to our dual mandate. impact on our dual mandate variables:  prices and employment.  Thinking about the three or four that are probably the most material from that point of view could well be useful.  An important issue, which I think is challenging, is that these themselves beyond the usual medium-term horizon of monetary policy-more like five years out, rather than two years out.  In other words, as noted by some has to allow for the possibility that longer-term risks to dual on risks and vulnerabilities that actually translate gauge the elasticities of these possibly longer-term dual mandate action today produce of the sharp fall in 2017 employment that That kind of elasticity analysis would allow policymakers of our benchmark outlook of this tradeoff. The second step is to risks with respect to current monetary policy.  For example, Tealbook, Book A, has a very nice alternative simulation about a credit boom.  We could ask ourselves, suppose the Committee were to raise the fed funds rate by 100 basis points over the next two meetings-how much would that monetary policy occurs in that alternative simulation? to formulate a tradeoff between medium-term dual mandate outcomes and longer-term dual mandate tail risks.  Policymakers could then adjust monetary accommodation in light

these steps-figuring out the risks to the dual mandate rough assessments will provide a at this time to affect the current stance of monetary policy, but I think we have for the possibility that this situation may well change as the economy improves.  For Now, to be clear, both of outcomes and the effects of monetary policy on those risks-are likely to take the form of assessments rather than precise estimates.  Nonetheless, these rough better basis for our deliberations.  I don't think these kinds of future tail risks are likely sufficiently large to be ready

December 17-18, 2013

this financial stability go-round and the surrounding staff are likely to prove to be one of your most important legacies to this Committee. this reason, Mr. Chairman, I think that analysis toward financial stability, and it's grounded in our current longer-run goals and statement.  That statement emphasizes that we're making monetary policy to the economy toward goals regarding prices and employment.  Financial I've tried to talk through.  Now, many observers have suggested that financial should be an entirely separate goal of monetary policy from prices and employment.  If financial stability is an additional will need to go about amending our framework of and policy strategy accordingly. The approach to financial stability that I've talked through is based on a very particular perspective policy strategy influence the progress of stability is only relevant to that conversation insofar as it's a factor that affects that progress in the way that stability this Committee wants to adopt such a framework, where objective of monetary policy, I think we longer-run goals

in your remarks at the centennial celebration, Mr. I think that transparency is a very important part of effective policymaking, and I we're being guided by some kind of goal that to think about financial stability as a separate actually have to be articulating that to the public, and, given the likelihood that financial going to start to become more and more a part of the conversation, I think that's As you emphasized yesterday Chairman, don't think we can be making policy effectively if we haven't shared with the public.  So if we want goal, we stability is something that we should start sharing with the public relatively soon.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

As the economy improves further with growth and diminishing resource slack, I expect the pull of anchored inflation Now, having considered the risk that inflation will remain too low for too long, what about the case that most envision-that inflation turns around and moves more assuredly toward our target?  Since this is I increasing expectations to show through more definitively in boosting actual inflation.

After all, it is hard for me to imagine that Some participants are overshooting our 2 percent target.  Several participants in the financial stability survey who were worried about higher inflationary risk focused on the idea that increased lending, supported by banks' excess reserves, could fuel large increases this more traditional and monetarist channel doesn't seem distinguishable from our normal concerns

With regard to inflation, it is the view of our staff, but also of my interlocutors, that inflation has stabilized. 1.3 percent, and I measure of the core CPI-it's hard to tell on that scale, but they've been stable months or so.  So the view among those levels, inefficiencies.  As I mentioned earlier, they're as possible and continuing to extract productivity I speak to-large, medium, small, public, and private.

However, as President Evans pointed out in his presentation, corporations still remain focused on squeezing out driving their SG&amp;A costs as aggressively gains, according to the ones that continue to focus on managing their bottom lines, as we discussed buybacks and their stock prices through dividend repayments, very much at the expense of capex and payroll expansion.

At first blush, this statistic suggests that there may be far more slack estimates that roughly 60 percent of the decline in labor force participation recession reflects persistent structural factors such as the aging of the prime-age workers onto disability benefit rolls.  This a significant role for structural factors in driving down participation is consistent with To be sure, there are two labor market indicators that are The first is the employment-to-population ratio, which has been nearly already than implied by the unemployment rate or other standard measures of slack.  However, this assessment hinges critically on how much of the participation drop is cyclical and how much is structural.

I pointed out last time that research indicates that virtually all of the decline in the participation rate in the moving into retirement. President Williams's 2007, about two-thirds of the entire decline in the increase in retirements, account for about 28 percent.  Now, both of those former workers, once they move into disability or into retirement, are likely to move back into the labor force.  Thus, the idea that the labor

I now expect GDP growth to slow in the fourth quarter final sales to accelerate. 3 percent drag should contribute significantly to a pickup in growth in 2014.  My staff estimates that the fiscal headwinds are subtracting decline to less than provide some further impetus to growth through both higher uncertainty.

growth has picked up August, and average hourly earnings in the private sector have begun to firm this year increased at a similar pace to that in 2012 despite this fiscal tightening.  This steady progress has led to an improved labor market outlook.  For Blue Chip consensus predicts average monthly payroll gains in 2014 of with the January survey earlier this year that reported 159,000 as the year ahead. Several factors also appear to support a strengthening in consumer spending over the forecast horizon.  In terms of income and wages, real disposable income notably since year.  Overall payroll growth this year's example, the December 194,000, compared expectation for 2013.  Rising household wealth, less debt, and some rebuilding of savings have also better positioned households to increase spending in the others have noted, the recent decline in a share that has steadily increased since the recession.  Consistently, the year, Labor force participation remains a key issue.  As participation appears to be driven primarily by longer-term trends such as the aging of the population.  My staff, too, has estimated that about two-thirds of the decline in participation this year has been structural, number of people not in the labor force who report they want a job has also declined this

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker.

Fifth District boards and over the last few very similar in tone to what President Lockhart reported. MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Between our roundtables, we have received a relatively large batch of anecdotal reports weeks.  Broadly speaking, they indicate that economic activity in our District is improving, but still mixed, and they are better, too, particularly in manufacturing.  Much but not all of the Some of the improvement reflects the waning of the effects, albeit limited, of the government shutdown in the northern part of the District.  The southern part of the District, the Carolinas, is now doing

December 17-18, 2013

generally, our manufacturing index is now solidly after some weakness in previous months, and readings on expected future readings for going to be released next Tuesday-show a sharp fallback into negative a little apprehensive about consumer spending, which I'll talk about improvement appears to be auto related.  More in positive territory conditions have improved.  Consistent with recent observations at the national level, our retail survey index showed dramatic improvement in November, although preliminary December-which are territory.  So that has me more in a minute.

since the last meeting have also, on balance, indicated growth was revised up.  So we have now averaged about 200,000 new jobs per report on retail sales was so strong that the goods orders have been relatively weak of late, relatively weak as well. For the national economy, reports improvement.  Employment growth for November was above 200,000, and employment for previous months month for the last four months.  Friday morning's staff felt compelled to revise an already weather-delayed Tealbook.  Nevertheless, it's worth noting that business investment and new capital and housing has been seems to be showing modest fluctuations around a modest growth rate.  It remains to be seen whether the recent pickup in PCE growth is the edge of the Tealbook scenario of a consumption-driven pickup in GDP growth or just the years.  I'm still yet or about to happen.  Moreover, even with the acceleration in years 2005 to 2007.  It seems to more likely that the personal saving rate remains in the high 4s, in which case Overall, the U.S. economy average leading typical fluctuation around a modest trend that we've been seeing for the last few a bit skeptical of the Tealbook's consumer spending scenario.  It is hard to find any direct evidence that it's happening income that the Tealbook projects, consumption is projected to grow so fast that the personal saving rate falls to around 3½ percent, a range last seen in the me that it's

December 17-18, 2013

at all in the near term.  As a result, my SEP GDP growing just a little above 2 percent for next year I'd like to make use, Mr. Chairman, of the 'Lockhart asterisk,' reflecting weak consumer spending is unlikely to accelerate much submission hasn't changed much and has and beyond, but conviction.

Lockhart asterisk?  Is that like Roger Maris? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I'm sorry.  The [Laughter]

Lockhart noted that he wanted to attach an asterisk to his conviction.  I'd like to apply the Lockhart asterisk to my MR. LACKER.  President inflation forecast-reflecting weak forecast.

I see.  Can we put an asterisk on the policy decision? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. [Laughter]

you've got conviction. MR. LACKER.  Unless

Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice

I'm going to put an asterisk on everything I say here. growth momentum has I am becoming more confident that this will (1) somewhat better economic data; that the degree of fiscal drag is abating; and (3) the modest the Congress-not because it reduces fiscal drag so much for 2014, but to Sturm und Drang by the Congress on the fiscal side, which risk and uncertainty. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. My assessment is very similar to many others, that the economy's improved somewhat over the past few months, and continue in 2014.  For me this reflects three elements: (2) the passage of time, which means sequestration bill by me it signals much less risk of future I think reduces are three developments that I would take note of.  The first other people have cited.  The most obvious Turning first to the data, there is the improvement in the labor market that many

December 17-18, 2013

is the acceleration of monthly payroll employment growth back to above 200,000 per month other elements of the signal both strength and breadth.  Moreover, they imply a sturdy real income trend, can be seen in the November retail sales data, which were not only strong for the retail sales data, what really matter.  The third factor on the data side is that the ISM sign over the last few months.  But I also put considerable stock in some of the most recent payroll employment report, such as the index of aggregate hours worked, which rose by ½ percent last month, and the overall diffusion index, which rose to 63.5.  To me, those indicators which leads to my second point:  Consumer spending appears to be on a firmer trajectory than before.  I think this November but also included upward revisions to the prior months; for revisions oftentimes are manufacturing sector has shown strength recently.  That's evident in the recent manufacturing survey, which climbed to its highest level since April 2011, with both the orders and production components now in the low 60s.  It's also evident in the strength we saw in the industrial production report yesterday, with a 1.1 percent increase in November.

I'd note is that the passage of time is also in our favor because the factor holding the U.S. economy back this that the drag at government, before multipliers, falls by half in 2014 compared with 2013, and other show an even larger decline in the amount of fiscal drag next year.  The is also in our favor with respect to other factors, such as household deleveraging, credit availability.  For example, as the staff briefing indicated, as home year. The second thing degree of fiscal drag, which I think was the primary year, diminishes considerably in 2014.  So the Tealbook, for example, estimates all levels of private estimates tend to passage of time home foreclosures, and prices continue to rise in most regions, the percentage of homeowners with mortgages that are underwater has fallen considerably, and this trend is likely to continue over the next

December 17-18, 2013

on the fiscal side appear to have its impact on the the risk of another government shutdown or debt-ceiling stalemate.  I willingness to challenge the far-right elements The third positive development for me is that the risks diminished.  While the sequestration adjustment is very modest in terms of fiscal stance-apparently about 0.1 percentage point of GDP for 2014-I take considerable signal from it in terms of also take some comfort from the House Speaker's of the House recently with respect to allowing some increase in fees to finance the reduced sequestration.

overconfident.  First, we have had years. That said, there are several reasons not to become temporary pickups in payroll growth before, and they have petered out.  And we have not, in my view at least, definitively broken out of the 2 percent annualized growth trajectory we've been on for several are some less positive elements of the environment that I think deserve accumulation climbed very sharply, I assume it was mostly voluntary, given I still have some you look at motor vehicle right now. Second, there note.  In particular, in the third quarter, the pace of inventory and my question is, was this voluntary or involuntary? that we've seen this persistent ongoing strength in the manufacturing sector, but uncertainty about this.  One aspect here that's interesting is that if inventories, they're on the heavy side

in mortgage that housing starts Third, the housing sector appears to have been more affected by the backup rates than I would have anticipated.  In this regard, the Tealbook's forecast will rise to an annual rate of 1.2 million units in 2014 from 0.9 million units in 2013-that's a 33 percent increase-seems a bit optimistic to me.

I've been most perplexed about.  Business fixed to the fundamentals.  We have a rising stock The fourth issue is the one that investment still seems inexplicably weak relative

December 17-18, 2013

clean balance sheets, and the level of investment is not high really grow capacity at any meaningful pace.  Yet we see capital outlays being quite If I started to see some resolution on the capital spending side, I think that would make market, high cash flow, relatively enough to weak. me a lot more optimistic about the outlook.

I disagree with some of the other people around the table is about inflation. certainly agree that inflation is too low and we should try to push inflation back to target, but you get into of debt deflation at the current time are Now, where I I'm not that worried about it because the real risk of inflation being too low is that the dynamics of debt deflation, and I feel like the risks pretty low.

gradually diminishing. you put these factors together and you expectations, it does seem pretty The third aspect is that nominal 4 percent annual rate in the second half of the year, rate of the first further rise in the growth rate of nominal GDP is anticipated for 2014.  This is really are rising more quickly, the risk that we're actually going to have a problem because of this low inflation diminishes that home prices and equity prices have been rising.  So you if you look at the sources of the mainly import prices, medical care, and the prices of There are five factors that make me feel not so worried about the risk of inflation being a little bit low right now.  First of all, the amount of slack in the economy is Second, inflation expectations remain well anchored.  If think of inflation as being driven by the amount of slack and reasonable to expect that inflation will rise gently in the future. GDP growth is rising at more than a according to the Tealbook forecast.  That's considerably faster than the 3 percent half, and a important when you think about the risk of debt deflation.  If incomes then quite sharply.  The fourth reason is have a rise in nominal GDP growth and a rise in asset prices.  That seems to argue pretty strongly against the risk of a debt-deflation type of scenario.  And, fifth, softness in consumer prices, they're

December 17-18, 2013

of excess slack that's of a story that we've got some special factors going actually imputed banking services.  That doesn't really seem to fit in with the story driving down inflation.  It seems to me more on that are temporarily pushing inflation down, and inflation is likely to go back upward.  And the reality is that these positive developments in terms of pushing prices down are boosting real income and making economic recovery, in my mind, more likely.

Tomorrow I'm going to talk about how I'll put all of this together for everything very carefully, the bottom line is I do think it's time to start the taper. So relative to other people around the table, I'm less worried about inflation being too low at the current time. monetary policy.  Putting it all together, balancing that

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Governor Yellen.

modal outlook I penned in this round's assessment of the risks has appreciably diminished downside risks to the outlook for the labor market I continue to see the risks to inflation MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The SEP is little changed from my September submission, but my changed.  I now see and more balanced risks to growth than in September.  But as tilted to the downside.

market, my assessment now, as in September, is that we have most labor market pace of payroll gains, the fraction of the labor force working part time reasons, the incidence of long-term unemployment, the level of UI claims, and the and quits, show continued, albeit gradual, improvement. Beginning with the labor made meaningful progress toward our maximum employment objective since the inception of our asset purchase program.  That said, there is still a long way to go.  But indicators, including the for economic pace of hiring

The decline in the unemployment rate since the inception of the program signals, to my mind, more dramatic progress, but a portion reflects a continuing decline in labor force

December 17-18, 2013

cyclical.  What worried me most all fall was that the labor market gains we have been seeing could prove In September, such a pickup in growth reality.  And as I feared, the pace of payroll gains had apparently been all summer and into the early fall. participation that in my assessment may well be partly summer and into the early unsustainable.  Recall that at the time of our September meeting, payroll employment had been growing at an average pace of 184,000 per month over the previous 12 months.  But the staff had been warning that job gains of this magnitude could only persist if growth were to pick up above the 2 percent trendlike pace we have been experiencing. was a hope but not a ebbing summer October that the average for total payrolls was running at just 143,000 per month.  In at 196,000 per month, and the 12-month gain is 175,000 to 200,000 range in which it has been fluctuating over the past So there is no sign at all that payroll gains have been petering out, even though output yet moved noticeably above the 2 percent range.  This suggests to me that further well be achievable, even absent a pickup in growth, although a reflect a more persistent decline in structural But incoming data have changed that picture significantly.  That worrisome swoon in payroll growth has evaporated amid data revisions and the stronger incoming data we have seen in the last two employment reports.  For example, it appeared in three-month moving contrast, the latest data suggest that it is running near the upper end of the two years. growth has not progress in the labor market may worrisome implication is that this pattern may productivity growth.

growth, recent news pertaining to spending has been mostly positive, gains.  Fiscal policy has been exerting a significant drag on growth, and that drag that the long-expected Turning to output and that's an important additional factor that has increased my confidence in the sustainability of labor market now appears poised to diminish.  In addition, incoming data suggest

December 17-18, 2013

finally be materializing.  I have been encouraged by the recent goods, as well as survey measures I worry that the increase in mortgage rates since the spring is exerting a larger drag than I acceleration in PCE may noticeable pickup in consumer spending, auto sales, and confidence.  Capital spending has been weak, but recent readings on orders and shipments of capital of business confidence, suggest that business investment in equipment and intangibles may be picking up, too.  That said, indicators from the housing sector have been decidedly soft of late, and had expected.

for next year in my SEP, and 2 percent thereafter, but I assess the risks to lie on the downside. Turning to inflation, I have projected a rate of 1½ percent gradual increases toward and the same is true for market-based core inflation.  Medical the story.  For example, the 12-month change in the core CPI, which is at 1¾ percent since the and import prices are not the entire story, and it's not really I remain optimistic that the 'Low Recent news has been somewhat concerning.  Both the 3-month and the 12-month rates of core PCE inflation have now drifted down to just 1.1 percent.  Since April, the 12-month rate has been running below 1¼ percent, prices are clearly part of much less affected by the behavior of medical prices, has held steady spring.  But medical service prices clear what else is holding core inflation down.  Wage gains have been steady, and long-run inflation expectations do appear to be well anchored.  So for now most recent decline in inflation will prove transitory and that we will avoid the scary Inflation' alternative scenario presented in the Tealbook.  Nonetheless, special vigilance on this count is in order.

conclude by summarizing my shifting views on risks to the outlook.  At our last I highlighted several possible scenarios for the economy going forward.  In my modal Let me meeting, scenario, which is similar to the Tealbook baseline, growth picks up gradually as the various

December 17-18, 2013

time of our previous two meetings.  But I am still far from certain, and our policy decision today but also what and how we communicate important to contemplate several alternatives. headwinds restraining demand abate.  In light of recent data, I place higher odds on such an outcome than I did at the in thinking about not only about our likely decisions going forward, I find it greater structural damage to the economy crisis than in the baseline.  The 0.8 percentage point decline year, coupled with monthly job gains in the range of 175,000 to well indicate a more lasting growth.  The relentless decline in labor force participation may greater supply-side damage.  But, as I noted at our October meeting, to me mud.  Structural return of inflation toward 2 percent, I think it is critical that our policy that approach clearly to the public. One plausible alternative scenario involves from the recession and the financial in the unemployment rate this 200,000 and real GDP projected to expand just 2¼ percent, may decline in structural productivity also be a harbinger of the most worrisome scenario is the one in which we become stuck in the productivity has not declined, but private spending picks up over time by less than the staff projects.  In this scenario, labor market improvement stalls out.  Recent indicators of economic activity reduce the likelihood of this scenario, but it's still far too early to rule it out.  Given that we face continued uncertainty about the pace of economic expansion, of labor market improvement, and of the remain data-dependent and that we communicate

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.

you, Mr. Chairman.  There are two things I was struck by in today.  One is people's emphasis on the pretty good stream of data is the fact that there has been strikingly little growth over the next couple of years.  I assume what I should a whole, the Committee is exactly where Janet is, which is to say that MR. TARULLO.  Thank listening to people so far we've had since the October meeting, and the other change in people's projections for infer from that is that, as

December 17-18, 2013

growth is in the offing. the most significant development in individual projections has been the decline in downside risks rather than some sense that greater that, to me, at least, there was surprisingly little impact from the government factored in already the actual fiscal other drama.  Also, of course, as several people have already of decent monthly job creation over not just the past four months, but suggests that we are on that plateau that I hypothesized earlier in the to be a standard for thinking about what constituted substantial improvement in the outlook I have to say shutdown and the fiscal cliff standoff.  We had all contraction associated with the sequestration, and there just didn't seem to be very much spillover effect from the commented, the durability really about a year now, year for the labor market.

growth, although at a continued modest level. also generally good, although as Bill commented, the apparent fiscal tightening of the last couple of quarters is an All of this does suggest that household deleveraging has indeed proceeded far enough along to create the conditions for self-sustaining Forward-looking indicators are impact on the housing market from the exception and one of some concern.

year, although from what I hear it will be mostly investment rather than creation of new capacity.  From what everybody says, new But apparently we're in a situation not dissimilar to that of consumers with years ago, where there is just enough depreciation in a lot of fixed plant is just going to have to be replaced. Like Janet, I have the impression, although it's anecdotally based, that business fixed investment may in fact pick up next replacement capacity is still something that people are not willing to invest in until they see increases in aggregate demand. automobiles a couple of and equipment that it

December 17-18, 2013

that the Congress has reached a budget prospect of another less risk that the ill feelings around the changes in confirmation rules in There's still some agitation around the debt-limit And, again, as several people have noted, the fact deal-whatever one thinks of the substance of that deal-has removed the shutdown and suggests the Senate could spread to other areas. extensions, but from what the leadership says, it appears they have concluded that fiscal-cliff drama is not a winning strategy.

I would make, though, is that reduction in risks is not the same as their two.  The first is that the support for has been mentioned by a number of people today appears to rest more on appreciation of equity assets has in turn been significantly supported by relatively accommodative further tightening of those conditions could lead or contribute to either even declines in prices in those generally, some of the brighter growth spots, such interest sensitive and, thus, particularly susceptible to a The second point elimination, and some risks do remain, so I will note consumer spending that wealth effects than it does on increasing income.  The wealth effect of the and housing financial conditions.  Any a leveling-off of the appreciation of those assets or perhaps markets-particularly equity markets.  More as auto sales, do seem to be particularly reversal.

you have mentioned, is the disinflation of the last two years to the a further decline in inflation.  Specifically, I'm not sure why inflation Second, as many of point where there would be concerns if it slipped further.  As of now, I, like Bill, find the implicit narrative behind the baseline projection of a modest-to-moderate uptick more plausible than the implicit narrative behind expectations would come unmoored on the downside now when they didn't during the depths of the recession.  The baseline, of course, is a view that is apparently shared by both the staff and,

December 17-18, 2013

FOMC.  But I'd join with others in observing that if we a greater concern. according to the SEP, everyone on the are even a little wrong on the downside, disinflation could become on structural damage, particularly in the I hear more certainty think is the case, based upon amount of examination and consultation with labor economists around the country.  The as it did before the recession.  The most obvious indication reluctant to leave jobs than they even during the first decade of the 2000s, and that, in turn, actually reflected significantly Finally, I do want to make a couple of comments labor market.  I don't want to impute any particular views to anybody, but around an analysis of what has happened in the labor market than I a fair labor market is clearly not operating of that is that currently employed people are substantially more were less willingness to leave jobs than in the 1990s.

room for intuition and predisposition around explanations of higher-thanI've seen, them on all sides, and nothing It is hard to sort out all that's going on.  For one thing, I would additional schooling.  I you said 17 percent or so, so that would be a significant difference.  But even so, I think and the fact that conditions are so different from what they were during the preceding 30 years make Even before the recession, the labor market was considerably less dynamic than in the 1990s.  And I don't think we really know the reasons for that long-term trend, at least not as of yet.  There is plenty of expected declines in participation rates, for example.  I actually think that, from what there are explanations with at least some data to support particularly clear has emerged. note, President Plosser, that we have different data than you appear to have.  I was looking back at the Board staff's data, and according to it, about one-third of the decline in the labor force participation rate since 2007 is attributable to people going back for thought the trends in long-term unemployment, the fact that unemployment is so high, labor market it very difficult to extrapolate any previously observed trends.

December 17-18, 2013

that they have retired is self-reported.  We all know that discount factors to any data gathered based on self-reporting.  Second, than they would have at full employment because the decision is being one set of factors rather than another.  This doesn't mean that people's hypotheses are coming back to the labor force.  I think we exactly is happening. First, for example, people saying you have to apply heavy though, even people who have indicated they have 'retired' may be indicating that differently under current conditions driven by about retirements are wrong or that these people just need to be a little more conditional in drawing conclusions about what over the course of the next several years, probably, certainly the next several quarters.  For example, I continue to pay more attention to what's areas, which seems, at least in the first instance, to be about a surrogate as any we can have for how much tightness or slack there actually is.  And been some pickup in at least one index of number 1, it is still pretty modest, and, number 2, if you take productivity you are not really seeing any general inflationary effects.  There is also no to suggest that skills mismatches are having a more acute effect on or, certainly, on wages than the chronic skills mismatch problem that we have 20 years. What that leads me to, in conclusion, is that we are going to need to be a little more tentative and pragmatic in decisionmaking and happening with wages in particular as good although over the past several meetings there has employment costs, increases into account, particular reason thus far labor markets experienced for about the last 15 or

going to need to be, as I said, a assessments, particularly when it comes to questions like how there actually is in labor markets.  But other than that, I join what seems come in this room about developments in the So I end, Mr. Chairman, with a suggestion that we are little provisional in making our much structural damage to be as close to a rough consensus as we intermeeting period.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

December 17-18, 2013

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Stein.

that the outlook seems a bit brighter than it did at the time of our September year have been marked growth for next year doesn't seem so much a triumph of hope over experience. MR. STEIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I also share the view that many others have expressed, which is and October meetings.  The growth estimates for the second half of this up considerably, to the point where my forecast of 3 percent to be been a little bit better than expected.  Sentiment has been rising. may even be getting a little bit of help from foreign GDP growth.  Outside of a generally on the upbeat side. end up playing a big role in this story, payroll Consumer spending has It looks like we somewhat worrisome loss of momentum in housing, the picture is And with the benefit of revisions, which actually growth looks to have been, in retrospect, consistently solid over the last several months, as others have mentioned.

encouraging.  It is interesting that, although I felt quite filled out my SEP, it had the property that Dan alluded to-I hadn't really But I felt better with the same numbers.  [Laughter]  That's actually some All in all, it feels modestly cheerful when I changed it that much. Bayesian kind of thing.

about the baseline forecast, which I think everybody well, I thought I would focus the rest of my comments on uncertainty around I thought might be helpful if we get there. Rather than saying anything more has covered very the evolution of one particular variable-namely, the unemployment rate.  And I'm doing so in anticipation of the thought that we may talk about thresholds at the next meeting, and I wanted to put out some data and a framework that first is the distribution of first-passage times might it take, and what is the uncertainty about Let me mention two sets of numbers.  The until we hit 6.0 percent.  That is to say, how long

December 17-18, 2013

So, obviously, it is model-dependent.  The numbers I am going to quote what you get out of this.  If you look across the thousands of simulations, the median percent starting from the fourth quarter of 2013 is seven quarters-just tail to this.  If you ask, 'What's the 90th years. the time of crossing 6 percent in the second half of 2017, and the 95th percentile the second half of 2018.  So that's fact number 1-the distribution of passage how long it might take? you come from some of the stochastic simulations that the staff already did for the October 2013 memo on inflation floors.  Bora Durdu and Bob Tetlow were kind enough to go out and actually look at the individual simulations and give me some tabs about the distributions, and here is basically time it takes to hit 6.0 under two years-which is roughly consistent with the Tealbook.  That would put us in the second half of 2015.  But there is a pretty long right percentile draw from among all of these simulations?' it's 15 quarters, or almost four That would put is 19 quarters, or times.

I was curious about is our uncertainty about or our distribution estimate of the long-run value of the natural rate is about 5.2 the confidence Fleischman have done some very nice work.  It is essentially a filtering a Kalman filter to extract an estimate of the natural rate.  In their modelas an indication-the standard error is plus or plus or The second number around the natural rate.  The staff percent.  John Roberts was kind enough to provide me with an estimate of interval.  He and Charles thing where they use again, it's model-dependent, and I use this only minus 0.66, I think.  So, roughly, a 90 percent confidence band would be 5.2 percent minus 1 percent.

I want to fix in your mind.  What does that do?  In your thinking, if at all, about thresholds?  Obviously, it depends on you have in mind. So those are two pieces of uncertainty what way does that inform the theory

I say there is a reasonable risk that if we have a 6.0 not hit it until 2017.  And I say, 'Well, that's kind of a scary What is interesting is in their results, if you look at what drives the crossing times to be very late, those bad draws The reason you get to 2017 is that the economy fiscal drag, what have you.  So if that's the issue, why should you care?  If you're weak aggregate demand, inflation is, therefore, very likely to problem with that? Take the first number.  Suppose percent threshold, we may proposition.'  A reasonable response would be, 'What's scary about that?' that are primarily driven by weak aggregate demand. falters, there is making slow progress because of be in check-what's the

I want to have a rebuttal to that, I need to add something to my story.  I need to add two contingency that is not well captured by financial stability concern of if rates are at zero through 2017 or 2018, reaching-for-yield pressures continue to build to the point where the potential fallout is greater than it is today.  Now, to get worse, just some your summary of Nellie's presentation is that, on a scale from 1 to 10, I say, 'By 2017 or 2018, there is a reasonable drift up to 7 or 8.'  Maybe that's one piece of the argument. If ingredients.  One would have to be an important inflation or unemployment.  A natural one would obviously be a some sort-the idea that may be clear, the concern doesn't have to involve a forecast that it will definitely uncertainty.  So if financial stability concern is now a 4, suppose probability that we may

We've got all of this other stuff. a financial stability concern of 7 relative to other stuff?  How do you Here is where the distribution of the natural rate is important.  If natural rate.  That is to say, you are going to The second piece is, what do you do with the number 7? What do you make of balance it against other things? you have the standard quadratic loss function, how much you care about financial stability versus providing accommodation and lowering the unemployment rate has to depend on the unemployment rate relative to something like the

So those the world where we of the reason that we percent is that the natural rate is on the high side.  Say it's 6.  So even if I'm quite close to Narayana-that, in the current a gap of 1½ percent between where we are and the natural rate, that a lot with a quadratic loss function and may even eclipse a 7 on the financial stability level the envelope get pretty close, that you need to start weighing the two together. Putting it all together, I'm not saying it's decisive, but if about being too forward leaning with a threshold, here is the scenario you want to have in mind. It's out there in 2017.  While inflation pressures are likely to be muted in this scenario because it is likely to be are more driven by the passage of concerns could, at least potentially, be building.  Moreover, in the state of stall out at, say, 6.2 percent unemployment, it's reasonably likely that part are stalling out at 6.2 you take the view-and this is where environment, if we have weighs worry index; but if that gap is 0.2, it's a different story.  In the end, at some condition is going to say, as we

And combined with for next year, that's potentially a big improvement. MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The narrative supporting pickup in growth has strengthened since the last meeting.

The first is that while monthly and affected by the first estimate of monthly payrolls, are so many broader indicators of labor market conditions that are much continued improvement. On unemployment, I quarterly payroll measures move up and down, the trailing 12-month payroll average has been remarkably stable around 190,000 per month, plus or minus 10,000 or so.

Another implication of that is probably that policy ought to be much less particularly when there more stable and show was also struck by the discussion in the Tealbook of recent forecasting history.

We discussed this puzzle at the September meeting numerous factors may be at play.  But the longer it goes on, the stronger the case supply-side by a paper by unwelcome declines in the labor force participation rate since 2011 retirements and not unlikely to return to the labor force.

All of that leads me to expect payrolls thousand per month as the economy improves, but with good months and bad months around that trend, accompanied by fairly rapid declines in the unemployment down to 6.3 percent at the end of this supportive of a decision to gradually reduce do weaken the argument that the U3 unemployment rate is sending a I do see a substantial improvement in the labor market since September 2012, and so it does seem to me that labor market conditions are purchases beginning tomorrow.  It also seems to me that the incoming data and, particularly, the supply-side damage story misleading signal about labor market slack.

Turning to inflation, the fourth-quarter deceleration in core inflation is troubling, particularly at a time when growth is picking up and slack is decreasing.  The baseline view is that the reasons for this decline are things that don't give us much of a signal about the future direction of inflation-medical prices, import prices, and the like.  So the baseline forecast for PCE and core inflation draw support from the fact that hourly expectations remain

now about the economy and our policy choices for tomorrow.  To put things talk about the two specific actions that we will be debating tomorrow.  The first with respect to unemployment.  I'll just talk about some of the considerations. we can have a fuller debate tomorrow. Let me talk in context, I will is whether to begin to slow asset purchases, and the second is whether to clarify or strengthen our forward guidance Obviously we'll leave this open until a criterionwere achieved On slowing purchases, I think we have to acknowledge that we did set namely, a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability.  The reason that we set that criterion at the time was, I think, that people uncomfortable with the idea that asset purchases would continue indefinitely until we our objectives.

I put in my survey was that the most convincing cost was financial stability, as a number of through term premiums, and we have so little year or two was term premiums with impacts on financial conditions I take most seriously, particularly given that we were so involved in the developments I thought we had a very useful survey on the perceived costs of balance sheet expansion. What people have suggested.  At least to my mind, one area where asset purchases may be different from low interest rates is the fact that they work understanding of term premiums.  What we saw over the last falling to a very negative level, no doubt for a number of reasons, but certainly partly because of asset purchases, and then we had a lot of market instability and confidence over the summer.  So I do think that is a downside of asset purchases, and the one that over the summer.

December 17-18, 2013

we have competing objectives, and we criterion of improvement in the labor a context of price stability as defining the conditions for asset purchases-I won't time on it, but I think there's been a pretty good case made that we are at least a situation where we can claim substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor year, and over the past five quarters, back to the we would like, but it is also causing since I spoke at my June press conference about what we were looking for. and fiscal policy, I think that is something that should growth going forward.  So I think that the substantial improvement criterion-again, we yet.  And I would a stopping point for at 7 percent unemployment.  We do have to pay some That being said, again, we have to recognize that have to think about that.  But for the moment, taking the market in spend a lot of approaching market.  As was noted by Governor Powell, we've been adding about 190,000 jobs per month over the past three months, over the past beginning of the program.  This is not as strong as significant reductions in unemployment.  The unemployment rate has dropped six-tenths of one percentage point Global growth is also somewhat stronger.  This is a factor that not as many people mentioned, but along with household spending promote certainly have made a lot of progress in that direction, even if we're not there note that in June we were talking about 7 percent unemployment as being the program, and, of course, we're now attention to our communication issues here.

against taking action, I think, and the best one, is low inflation, 'in a context of price stability' was really more of a condition about wanting to achieve a certain inflation rate.  Nevertheless, I Now, the main argument which we don't fully understand.  I think the fail-safe than it was a think there is a reasonable case that it will be harder to explain why we're taking this action-if we are-in the face of very low inflation.

December 17-18, 2013

I would like to raise now, and we can put it on the table tomorrow for full strengthening the statement a bit in that direction.  There are a couple of things that suggestion about strengthening the language about monitoring inflation to.  The other thing, which is more substantive-and again, maybe we'll tomorrow-is adding a sentence in the that explicitly says that if the concern and asset purchases and inflation. So what discussion, is I think we could do-and again, this is just putting things on the table.  One thing would be to accept President Evans's to make sure that we think it's moving toward 2 percent.  I don't think that adds anything that anyone can really object provide some bracketed language on this to talk about place where we talk about the conditionality of slowing purchases inflation continues to remain low-or something-we would consider pausing the process.  We can discuss that further tomorrow.  But what I'm suggesting here is that one way to accommodate this concern is to strengthen the statement in ways that reveal perhaps even make more explicit the relationship between want to talk about is the idea of strengthening or clarifying the have in alternative B to explain why I think that's not an why I think it's economically The second thing we forward guidance, whether that would involve qualitative guidance like we or a 6 percent threshold, whatever it is.  Let me try unreasonable thing to consider, however we decide to do it, and sensible.

you know, every Tealbook, Book B, presents optimal control monetary policy, to commit to future Now, I thought it was quite interesting to compare the optimal control exercise for you to take the I think a useful way to look at it is through the lens of the staff's optimal control exercises.  As which takes into account the zero lower bound and assumes that we're able rate changes. this meeting with the one from December 2012, which was the meeting where we put in the 6½ percent state-contingent guidance.  Let me just say that I'm not asking

December 17-18, 2013

I want to make.  In any case, what's happened since December 2012?  Obviously, fallen a lot more quickly than expected, and indeed, the unemployment made as of 2012:Q4 was 7.8 percent.  It's 7.1 percent for this quarter.  So would you expect to happen to the liftoff date in the optimal control exercise?  Well, the ago the liftoff date was the first quarter of 2016, and today it's the third come down a lot more than expected, and yet the optimal optimal control exercise as anything more than an illustration of some of the economic arguments unemployment has forecast for this quarter what answer is that a year quarter of 2016.  Unemployment has control liftoff date has been pushed out by two quarters.

There are two reasons, basically.  The first one, tying back to my previous December 2012, when rates lifted off in the first six- to seven-tenths of a percentage point end of 2015.  In the very long run, there's much less difference, fairly considerably. Why? discussion, is the behavior of inflation.  Inflation has also been a lot lower than the Tealbook expected.  In optimal control simulations in quarter of 2016, it was assumed that inflation would be 1.9 percent.  Now, with liftoff in the third quarter of 2016, the optimal control exercise has inflation at 1.6 percent.  So even though liftoff is two quarters later, inflation is lower.  The other change, which is interesting, is the fact that the staff have lowered their estimate of the natural rate by for the whole period through the but just for the next two years, they've lowered it are a couple of reasons. participation is falling, and if it is the fact that those people who are most likely to to otherwise leave the labor force are those who are either unemployed or have a high going to tend to lower the natural rate-not for good Now, I immediately acknowledge Governor Stein's point about the high standard error.  I think he probably understated the standard error around the natural rate, but what's the economic reason for thinking that the natural rate might be lower?  Well, there One is that retire or propensity to be unemployed, that's

December 17-18, 2013

people still looking The other reason-which is more positive, and which was explained in the staff's June lowered their estimate of the natural rate-is that their concerns about damage to the labor market and increased skill mismatch have been reduced, basically for the reason that what we've seen is unemployment coming down much more quickly prices or wages.  That suggests that, in some got more room to go. reasons, but, nevertheless, it does lower the average unemployment rate of for work. 2013 memo on why they structural simply than expected, with no signs of inflation in either sense, we've good indicator of the labor market, and because inflation is lower and because there appears to be Let me just add to that that the unemployment rate at the takeoff point reduced considerably, again reflecting the lower NAIRU estimates. So, again, despite the fact that unemployment is a despite the fact that it has come down a lot more than expected, the optimal control simulation pushes out the date for raising rates more scope to push unemployment down, given the fact that it has come down so quickly without inflation. likewise has been

year ago to put in the 6.5 percent as a threshold for the was itself somewhat conservative relative to the optimal control exercises, fact that we did have this fail-safe on inflation.  I think the reason it was was that we were concerned that the natural rate might be higher than we thought Well, here we are a year later. a problem.  Unemployment has come down quite a bit.  So it seems to a reasonable case that, relative to a year ago, we have more scope to push on that Our initial decision a unemployment rate and relative to the conservative and we would end up getting ourselves into an inflation problem. Inflation is not evidently me that there's particular indicator.

we do it-whether it's by lowering the threshold, about which whether it's qualitative-that's for tomorrow's Now, exactly how Governor Stein raised some relevant issues, or

December 17-18, 2013

I think there's an economic case for it.  And it's also consistent with the of people around the table suggested that if we going to strengthen, modify, or clarify the guidance, it would be good to do that in So this is just meant to lay out some of the discussion, but discussion we had in October, in which a number were conjunction with some change in asset purchases. basis for the discussion that we'll have tomorrow.

I know it is a highly speculative question, but I'm just asking for whether that would make a big difference. MR. ROSENGREN.  If conditions, how much of an effect do you think there would be than a qualitative forward guidance-moving to a 6 percent threshold-relative to what we currently have in your own sense of guidance to a lower threshold as a little bit firmer-as something that would give a little a long time, relative to the qualitative guidance written down.  I'm not sure that's a big difference, but I expect that's the direction MR. ENGLISH.  My sense is that market participants see a quantitative change in the forward bit more confidence that rates would stay low for that we have it goes in.

My second question was about the effect of the SEPs.  I think we made the point earlier that in the SEPs, the median forecast for the funds rate in 2016 was the same now as it was in September.  So we haven't really market may be ours market participants have come down.

Let David Wilcox to update of the more obscure and peculiar government shutdown was that the Census Bureau was in the unusual gain MR. WILCOX.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  One consequences of the situation this morning of publishing not only housing permits for November, but also starts for three months-September, October, and November.  The permits numbers, which we pay much more attention to, were right in line with our expectations.  Single-family permits edged up about 10,000 to 634,000 in November.  Multifamily permits reversed some of their extraordinary in the prior month and fell back to 373,000.

the starts numbers were weak in September and October, but we'd already guessed that that would be the 2008, when way down. In judging the underlying trends, we pay much less attention to because they're much noisier than permits, and this morning they lived up to that reputation. They case, based on other information Census had already released.  They jumped in November to 727,000, which is the strongest reading on single-family starts since early construction was on the whether the market this morning is distracted by the strong starts that there's likely to be very little news for our forecast, with maybe just a few billion It'll be interesting to see number or they manage to look through that.  But for us, given the permits numbers, I'm expecting dollars shifting between this quarter and next quarter.

I stated in my economy-round statement, I am concerned about the disinflationary in the price data over the last few months.  This trend, as I read it, is problematic on two represents a widening deviation from our price-stability target, but it I, or possibly we, are misreading the economic signals and As trends counts in that it not only also is a worrisome red flag that

December 17-18, 2013

get some firming up of the growth.  But I also recognize a tapering decision at this meeting as we can hope. therefore could be overly optimistic about the underlying trend in real activity.  For this reason, I have some sympathy with waiting another meeting or two to see if we inflation statistics as well as stronger confirmation of accelerating that our communications seem to have achieved substantially what was intended, and market expectations appear to be as well aligned for concrete as we can about the path adjustments to the LSAP program begin.  I believe that financial market that we should set a high bar for any decision that this is the case. At the last meeting, I stated my preference for being as for asset purchases once uncertainty will be minimized and our policies will be more effective if we lay out as clear a path as possible for winding down our purchases.  I feel to suspend the wind-down or reverse course, and that we should signal

to alternative B that would nudge expectations in the direction to taper as the beginning of a reasonably predictable process for LSAP program.  For one, I think there is a case for starting by reducing purchases by that actual reductions in purchases begin in January, the pace would take us through the June or July meeting, with an end of the It seems to me that a pace of mind, starting at a tentativeness that may generate uncertainty I think there are changes of seeing a decision today exiting the the amount of $20 billion, as presented as an option in an earlier draft of alternative B, rather than $10 billion.  Assuming suggested by this first taper LSAP program completed by sometime in the third quarter. reduction of $10 billion, if that's the assumed meaning of 'measured steps,' would drag out the process for longer than desirable and longer than markets expect.  To my $10 billion and describing it as modest conveys about our intentions.

the paragraph 4 with the Now, I know the likely outcome today is $10 billion, but if $20 billion was downstroke, my suggestion would be to replace 'further measured steps' in

Paragraph 4 would then read, 'the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases important, in my mind, than the amount.  As a general statement, the markets are going to make guesses about future steps, and it is better to tell the markets what we can to avoid wrong guesses. unwanted volatility.

We cost of In my estimation, we have little evidence that the costs associated with whatever we can to more quickly return both to their goals.  My forecast is that even waiting until March to reduce would still leave us below our 2 percent inflation target and the unemployment rate MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My leave financial conditions unchanged until we see data that clearly indicate real GDP above potential and clear movement of PCE inflation back toward our target of 2 percent. forecast is that such evidence will be more apparent in the data by our March meeting. three reasons for get above-potential real GDP growth with inflation moving toward our should wait until these outcomes are in the data, not just in the forecast.  Second, the patience is quite low. increasing our balance sheet will be much higher if we wait until March to begin tapering. Third, with inflation so low, we should be doing elements of our mandate purchases just above my estimate of the natural rate three years from now.

am concerned that, by reducing purchases at this meeting, we risk tightening financial I'm wrong.  Such a tightening would put at I conditions, possibly significantly.  I certainly hope

But quantitative forward guidance, support alternative B, which risks a further and, in my view, premature tightening of financial My strong preference is to do nothing such as lowering the unemployment threshold in our statement to 6 percent, would mitigate my concerns.  There does not seem to be sufficient support for that now.  However, I cannot the current conditions.

more In summary, with the unemployment rate still elevated and the inflation rate well below the FOMC target, changes in the purchase program are premature until incoming data clearly indicate that the economy has sufficient momentum to sustain GDP growth faster than its potential rate.

We can current flow-based LSAP a specific amount of frame appreciate the staff's effort to include something on this in a question about the size of total purchases.  The Committee want.

My suggestion was to announce an intended purchase of additional securities, noting the total size of the program when it's completed and the time over which it would be completed.  I alternative C, but this is really not can make that whatever they I think it would bring clarity to the program.  It would avoid the continued speculation from meeting to meeting about our near-term intentions without jeopardizing our regarding the

To me, this is Chinese water torture, for us and the markets. I'm concerned, and does not or improving the economy.  So I think it's very important that we still as we possibly can. The speculation that's be, are they step?  Are they And that Chinese water torture is absolutely unnecessary, as far as contribute to either clarity try to achieve as much clarity meeting.  I believe the criteria we that tapering today will come as too much of a be some reaction, but I don't think that should deter us. I do support a reduction in the pace of purchases at this laid out in June for beginning to taper have been met.  While the exact timing of the taper may not be known to the market, I don't believe surprise.  Yes, there will

agree with much of what President Lockhart said.  I, too, could support a larger stepas a way of signaling our resolve.  I think most of us agree and or $10 billion less, is come to believe that most of our intention, as opposed to the actual economic effect of a marginal another. I of $20 billion-at this meeting understand that the actual pace of purchases, whether it's $10 billion more not the determinative factor for the economy.  Many people have the effect is on signaling $10 billion one way or

I think we should have some changes in language to help clarify our intentions more. I have said, it's important to try to turn our focus away from meeting-to-meeting changes in are reluctant to do so because it would appear to be backing away from on a preset course.'  I think there are times withdraw-for clarity and for our effective communications. But As the flow of purchases, and laying out a path of purchase reductions would improve things.  I sense that some people our earlier statement that 'asset purchases are not when we have to strategically

December 17-18, 2013

approach that is more in keeping with the is to be clear that further reductions are the default and that it would take significant outlook to alter that presumption.  We could simply replace the second 4 by reversing the clauses and saying, 'The Committee intends to reduce purchases in further measured steps at future meetings unless the economic Rather than specifying the path, another statement changes in the economic sentence in paragraph the pace of asset outlook weakens significantly from current projections.'  That just reverses the language in a way that strengthens it and signals the presumption that we will be continuing.

to do that that the Committee may wish to consider.  In that the expectation'-one change that might strengthen that a little bit is to say 'So long as expectation.'  That just gives it a little tweak to better communicate that Now, there is a softer way same sentence-which begins 'If incoming information broadly supports Committee's incoming information supports the Committee's suggest that we are presuming it's going to continue this way, and may we are more likely to continue on this path than not.  I think that would help our communications.

B's language about forward guidance on the would prefer that we come closer in trying to describe our current thresholds, rather than about changing the thresholds that don't convey very much about why we're conditions would cause us to act after a threshold is met.  Our reaction not acting after we get to 6½ percent.  Depending on what inflation is activity is, we could choose not to act, and the reaction function may help us I'm also uncomfortable with alternative funds rate path in paragraph 5.  I anticipated behavior or reaction function once we pass one of our making statements changing them or what function may lead to our and what economic do that.  But just to leave it open, I find, is both confusing and a bit problematic.

December 17-18, 2013

appear, for example, that there is a consensus that our policy path is likely to be agree that rates would rise around in one form or we're not going to act just because one variable isn't behaving the way good indicator.  And we talked a lot yesterday about the going on with labor force participation, but it's not clear that all bad news or that the unemployment rate is giving us the wrong signal. It does more gradual as the economy improves, with rates lower and rising more slowly than we typically see.  And even if there's less agreement as to why that might be the case-and there are different stories that people have told-it's still true we can probably more slowly than otherwise.  So I think that we would serve ourselves well with forward guidance in trying to articulate that path rather than moving our thresholds another or signaling that we think it should.  Part of my concern here is also that we seem to be stressing the fact that the unemployment rate is not a sufficiently labor force participation rate.  Independent research done around the System seems to suggest that there are some unusual things they're a flatter-than-usual policy rate path in the larger increases in policy rates if in fact they are needed, due to President Kocherlakota talked about yesterday. behavior will be different than normal, but we'll still be systematic in federal funds rate lower than it typically I think we can convey that we anticipate statement, without precluding either inflation dynamics or financial stability, as We can convey that our responding to changes in economic conditions.  For example-and this is just an example-the fourth sentence of paragraph 5 could read something like, 'Based on the Committee's assessment of economic conditions and the outlook, if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, then even if the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, the Committee anticipates keeping the would as economic conditions improve.'

December 17-18, 2013

Chairman suggested that we consider thresholds.  I oppose I think it will be confusing and will undermine their credibility.  I also grounds that our estimate of the natural rate has for maximum employment because we don't know what determines it. thresholds based on our view of what the long-run natural rate is going that the in fact, changed over time.  Would have to raise the threshold back up in response to that movement in the We don't know what the natural rate is doing, and I think it would be bad for us to As to other changes, the changing the thresholds. would be troubled by changing thresholds on the either declined or changed in some way.  Our January 2012 statement said we're not setting specific numerical goals But, to me, adjusting our to be is doing exactly that.  And so I'd be very troubled with that strategy.  Suppose Board staff's view of the natural rate has moved up-it has, we then, to be coherent, natural rate? get ourselves caught in that bind.

in this morning, language as it stands.  The red language that we 'will monitor inflation developments carefully.'  I think that's pretty clear and I would leave that and not make the change in blue.  I would be change in language in paragraph 4, Mr. Chairman. Finally, with regard to the two changes in the language that were brought my preference would be, in paragraph 2, to leave the red says pretty straightforward, so comfortable with the

I listen to this conversation, I'm going to be I'm going to talk about these things in the press conference.  Let me just CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  As thinking about how make a comment here on the use of the unemployment rate.

gains in the that really wasn't the right way to think about it.  In a speech about a I actually said something like, 'The unemployment rate is the best single indicator An early version of the statement said something to the effect that unemployment rate had overstated progress, which we eliminated, and I think the discussion yesterday suggested that month ago,

December 17-18, 2013

and that's why we're using it to essentially trigger the broader conversation about I'm asked threshold, my plan is to say something like, 'Well, again, the best single indicator.  It tells us when to begin looking.  But we don't analysis of the labor market to a single variable.  The sense of the the accuracy of the unemployment rate, I would just good signal to think about looking at the whole range of variables, without any kind of bias in the unemployment rate. that we have, what's happening in the labor market.'  So, assuming we do not lower the threshold, if why we didn't lower the unemployment rate is the want to tie our entire Committee was that, once we get to 6.5 percent, we want to look at a broader set of variables at that point'-so, without downplaying suggest that it's a saying there's that the language in paragraph 5 seems stronger than that.  It get to 6½ you just said. MR. PLOSSER.  That's fine, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with all of that, and that's okay.  My reading, though, of the statement is seems to be making a much stronger statement-that we will not do anything when we percent.  It's not definitive, but, to me, it sounds stronger than what

'anticipates.'  So the notion is that once configuration of labor market variables at that time, our It's not really meant to be a time-dependent statement. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, but it says we get to 6½ percent, thinking about the best guess is that an overall assessment of the labor market will not yet precipitate an increase in rates.

Okay.  That's fine.  I think those comments would be helpful in your MR. PLOSSER. press conference, so I support that.

forecast if we could start to see an actual confirmation that inflation is not falling Meanwhile, inflation developments have been worrisome.  Our forecast is still that diminishing resource slack and expectations that the FOMC will maintain appropriately accommodative policy will be enough to get inflation moving back toward our 2 percent target. But here, too, I'd feel more comfortable about our turnaround in the numbers or, at a minimum, some further.

Governor Yellen mentioned the possibility that we could get stuck in the mud some time to get down to 6.  I agree with her is likely to just stick around where it is at too low an inflation rate, and that would as well.  So I'm worried about that. Yesterday with unemployment below 6½ percent, but taking that that could be worrisome.  I think that the inflation projection along that type of stuck-in-themud scenario be worrisome aside, because this subject came up yesterday when I asked a question inflation and Stacey Tevlin mentioned that there are some BEA handles certain medical prices, and so now maybe inflation is change.  And then we talked about, well, strategy for that was that we would not be acceptable just because some price was Let me make an about the transitory elements in PCE changes in the way that the going to continue to be lower than it was before that should that mean that our 2 percent objective should be 1.8 percent?  My view on this-and I'd welcome a more robust discussion-is that, in our longer-run goals and policy statement, when we decided that 2 percent was our objective, the big basis wanted a sufficient wedge in nominal interest rates so that we would avoid hitting the zero lower bound very often.  And so 1.8 percent

December 17-18, 2013

would indicate that we needed more accommodation so that, on average, the the FRB/US model suggests that we're likely to hit the zero bound more often than we I think there were behaving differently.  It all prices were 2 percent, and the probability that nominal interest rates would hit the zero lower bound remained low-in spite of some of the evidence that President Williams has that history of thought.  It would be nice to have a more robust discussion of that, because different viewpoints.

Now, But essentially, we shouldn't see any meaningful Treasury rates beyond what we would expect from improving growth and could be some bounce after the SEP.  That's why I whether markets are expecting anything like what is in the SEP projections for the federal I thought we could see an outsized increase in long-term interest rates based on Having said that, in this environment, I think today's policy to the outlook.  We should only take stance so that we have time to better assess the strength of the confidence that inflation is poised to turn back up.  For my support today, the most important criterion is that our actions not lead to more-restrictive monetary and judging that is always fraught with ambiguity. increase in 10-year improvement in the inflation forecast.  There asked funds rate.  If this action, I'd be reluctant to support this.

I thought the no adjustment to our LSAP program today, as in alternative A, and that So which alternatives can deliver on this criterion?  As I considered it, safest choice is to make would be my preference-to take that route today.  I think markets would properly understand that this is a brief holding pattern until we accumulate more evidence of improvement that we expect.  Markets would not be surprised if we waited until January or March.  On that basis, I have many sympathies with the position that President Rosengren took on that.  However,

I think like 'tapering is not a tightening of monetary policy.' goal today.  I'm not sure if everybody else shares that.  Maybe I'm a little I think that's what our language is intended to convey. history is not on the side and so I'm certainly willing to think through how this should go.  The question I have is whether we can have a reasonable today's that's what we mean when we say things That ought to be our bit naive on that, but alternative B does have a number of things going for it to meet this criterion.  First, It's only $10 billion.  I could have imagined that the first time out, we would choice.  Now, President perhaps $20 billion, and more certainty on the path, would be a good I'm not sure I completely disagree with that, if the first action was taken at the right time. that the suggestion Dennis had was, January might be ripe for that.  In my mind, it tapering is what we're going Well, the taper is small. do a larger number than that, and I think that mitigates against an outsized reaction.  As Simon Potter mentioned, markets seem prepared for this, so that could be a fine Lockhart mentioned that idea. And I believe might be March, if it was confirmed by the data and all of that, but to do at some point, and I'm expecting it to occur sooner rather than later.  But again, I think $10 billion is good for today.  That's the size of the reduction.

also thought a taper would be accompanied by a guidance.  So I also think that strengthening forward guidance is key to and keep the stance of policy relatively unchanged.  I would have an impact.  We also have the Now, of course, the majority of dealers change in forward keeping the taper from being read as a meaningful policy tightening.  My preference, again, would be to move the unemployment threshold to 6 percent or even lower.  This would likely be enough to offset the modest initial taper think a lower number is simple, it's visible, and it

December 17-18, 2013

you thought that inflation would pick up, then we'd have a reason to inflation got to be a problem.  But again, moving the threshold does not look to other things to mitigate this tightening inflation safeguard so if tighten policy before appear to have the support of the Committee at this time.  At one point, it was a suggestion in alternative B, but it's not any longer.  So I must perception.

I don't anticipate that that can live with that.  If we include the language in paragraph 2 that inflation-that's really important for me in is not likely to lead to greater tightening.  Furthermore, the statement aligns policy conditions.  As inflation moves up, as we are expecting I have in my own SEP, this part of the statement is quickly going to lose As a third-best policy, I can support the current alternative B, with the post-threshold guidance that is included in paragraph 5 in its current, relatively strong fashion and the stronger inflation language in paragraph 2-the assurances that inflation is going to be moving up toward our that. trigger.  I did note paragraph 1 to say that it's not just below target, but well below target, because 0.7 percent will be taken up, and I indicates that we're not complacent about the low assessing that this tapering in paragraph 5-that if projected inflation continues to run below 2 percent, the first rate hike could be delayed-provides a key link between our goals and policy action.  I think that's also useful and important.  Including comments like this in the statement more closely expectations to the changing inflationary it to do and as importance and no longer be actionable.  That's what the intention is, and so that would be

This type of language can act as an important automatic stabilizer, particularly during times when current policy actions are alternative B as long as there's no dilution of the as the strengthened forwardfunds rate would be lower than normal-I forget his exact language.  That's (1993) is what the normal response would be.  So as long as we're lower than Taylor I don't think that's what we intend.  That would clearly be So, Mr. Chairman, I can support important message about our concern over low inflation and as long guidance language is not altered in a way that makes it appear to be a tightening.  I find myself in disagreement with President Plosser over changing the language to mention that, after we get to 6½ percent, the vague.  It's open to so many different interpretations.  For instance, John Taylor would say Taylor (1993), we'd be fitting that bill. tightening, in my mind, if we did that.  We'd have to work an awful lot on that alone.

My remarks are going to be as acknowledge a substantial labor market improvement since September 2012.

That criterion was that we I stated yesterday, I think the cumulative basis.  In particular, achieving an So, first, let me clear were looking for substantial improvement in labor markets.  As case is strong that we have met this criterion on a unemployment rate of 7 percent is an important milestone for the Committee, as this is a point at which earlier discussions suggested we might be completely finished with the asset purchase

Acknowledging progress in labor market outcomes is important to maintaining our credibility.  We need to make sure that markets know that we mean what credibility on this occasion will help us in all aspects of policy think it's wise to take advantage of the believe that there is an important upside to this decision.  I've been worried years that the Committee's promises to stay low for a long time were we will take a concrete action that expresses some confidence in the prospects for U.S. and labor markets going forward.  I'm hopeful that this action will provide something of U.S. macroeconomic outlook. Second, I during the last few inadvertently sending a very pessimistic signal about the future of the U.S. economy.  Today, however, growth a catalyst for improved private-sector expectations concerning the In other words, we are sending an optimistic signal instead of a pessimistic signal on the future of U.S. economic performance.

you know, I've been very concerned about this and have at times suggested discussing, others on the Committee have also emphasized this point. Finally, much of the discussion yesterday focused on the drift downward in U.S. and global inflation.  As that we should wait to taper until we see inflation moving back toward 2 percent.  And as President Evans was just We do not have that situation today, but my judgment is that the labor market improvement has become too compelling to ignore, and, therefore, that it's wise to taper a small amount at this meeting.

yesterday to the many comments on low inflation, I heard a lot of hopeful half of 2014 for the possibility that inflation may continue to move a response in mind for that possibility should it develop.  The best In listening forecasts, including my own.  I remind the Committee that hope is not a strategy.  We have to be prepared during the first lower.  We need to have

I would be open to other options, but want to reiterate that I'm an advocate of keeping the pace of purchases clearly stateknow what the future holds and we may be surprised in either direction. wish to either speed up the pace of tapering or slow it down, especially also want to mention that I do Lockhart, and maybe is a general principle that is derived from the research on DSGE models over the last I contingent, as we do not In other words, we may on the grounds of less-than-desirable inflation developments.

I think the 'well past' language does seem to lean in that direction-not thinking of raising interest rates when unemployment hits percent So I'm concerned today that the whole story becomes tapering.  We don't coming out of this meeting to be tapering, and I think the press conference is an opportunity to highlight that.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. PLOSSER.  Mr. Chairman?

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.

First, just to clarify, President Bullard, there is no optimal policy design I'm aware of.  I know of no theory according to which we can write not sure we're able to determine what is the right rule, if you will, or that purchases ought to go by. MR. PLOSSER. for asset purchases that down an optimal control problem with asset purchases and derive optimal control policies for asset purchases.  So I'm conditioning statements,

I would make is that our asset purchase programs are conditional and chose to do so.  We did QE1, and then we did was not responding.  Subsequently, we did Operation Twist, and then In fact, I wouldn't even taper.  I would just keep the $85 billion and then stop it economy was not cooperating, we could do it again. The second point have been conditional.  We've tended to announce programs and have always been able to add another program or restart a program when we QE2 because the economy we started QE3. at some point, with the clear knowledge that if the restart the program and

December 17-18, 2013

not optimal, but it's clear that it's very part of the problemasset like to have one.  We don't know how to specify that optimal I don't think it's clear that the path here is confusing by not specifying what our reaction function really is, and that's we haven't been able to do that.  So I would say that we don't have a Taylor rule for purchases, much as we might control problem, either.

you'd let me respond briefly, and then we'll get off rule for asset purchases, but if we could going on in the economy and how you're going to adjust the policy instrument.  In that I've been an advocate of state contingency for the pace of asset purchases, and expectation into markets.  So in some sense, we do have a dial can turn this dial in a modest way in what the optimal policy MR. BULLARD.  Mr. Chairman, if this subject.  It's true that we don't have a Taylor-type write down the model, we know that the optimal policy would be some kind of mapping between what's sense, that's why I think we've managed to get that that we can turn in a modest way, as we're doing today.  We reaction to developments in the economy.  At least that has the flavor of rule would look like, even if we can't exactly specify the rule.

going to entirely stop continuous process.  So with that, I'll stop.  Thank you, Mr. Your points about state contingency, in the sense that we can start new programs, are valid, but, to me, that's a more volatile way to conduct policy, as we're programs, and then come back with new programs later as developments don't go in our direction.  I think you need to have a more continuous process, and the pace of asset purchases gives us a dial that provides a more Chairman.

December 17-18, 2013

at that time, there were good arguments for waiting.  Incoming and debt ceiling reduction in the pace of purchases data hinted that the economy might be losing momentum, and the budget debates were looming.

toward tapering.  Labor market and have been solid, and the budget agreement means less fiscal drag and the cumulative greater confidence in the economy's underlying I would echo the comments of President Bullard that our message should based on the success of the on our employment objective.  It also a concern I now hear from my contacts-that the ongoing 'taper on/taper off' chatter and distraction, even as uncertainty about the has waned. Developments since then clearly shift the balance consumer spending data less policy uncertainty.  Reducing the pace of purchases is fully justified by improvement in labor markets and our momentum.  And here be clear and strong.  Assuming that the taper is begun, our action is program and the substantive progress we've made addresses has become a heightened source of uncertainty economy and fiscal policy can't eliminate all uncertainty, and I think paragraph 4 appropriately that policy is not on a preset course.  Indeed, to be consistent with this point, I would that 'the asset purchases in measured steps,' not 'in further $10-billion-per-meeting cuts.  Everybody knows that two data points and, with the language of 'further,' if we did $10 billion reductions for two I fear that the perception would be that we're locking this in. Of course, we makes clear actually omit the word 'further' in the second sentence of paragraph 4.  I would say Committee will likely reduce the pace of measured steps.'  At best, the word 'further' is unnecessary.  At worst, it could be construed as locking us into a path of make a trend, meetings,

we really want to do in the future.  It could be that the economy might want to taper a little faster than $10 Now, I'm not sure what does a lot better than we're thinking and that we

December 17-18, 2013

you do $10 billion a meeting, we end the next year.  It could also be, as President Bullard has mentioned and as to behave the way we want, and we might want much as possible.  I change, but I do think that the language should show, as best we billion a meeting.  As everyone knows, the math is, if program in December of others have mentioned, that inflation is not going to slow the pace of tapering.  So I want to have that optionality in there as recognize that this is not a big can, that we may adjust further actions based on economic events.  Now, the $10 billion reduction is an appropriate small first step, but again, we should be leaving it open to the possibility that we'll change the pace in the future.

President Plosser has brought up, I do think that the language in a future meeting, when we're closer to hitting the and stating an end date and total remaining quantity of At that time, stating the specifics of how the program will end should provide clarity is now, but I do imagine that, at a certain Getting to the issue that this statement is the right thing.  But at substantial labor improvement mark and to ending the current purchase program, I would support shifting away from the open-ended policy purchases. and reduce uncertainty.  I don't think the time for that point, that might be the best end game.

too accommodation.  For this reason, an earlier funds rate And I think the language in paragraph 5 does exactly that.  It appropriately highlights our guidance on what we expect to happen after we reach the threshold policy unemployment rate in Of course, there's no question that unemployment is still too high and inflation is still low, and the situation continues to call for substantial monetary we need to make it crystal clear that reducing asset purchases does not imply liftoff. expectation that we'll keep the funds rate at its current range until the unemployment rate is well below 6½ percent.  Such should reinforce the perception that we're providing continued substantial accommodation.  Furthermore, it puts low inflation as well as the elevated

December 17-18, 2013

good thing.  It shifts the conversation toward a more 6½ percent unemployment in late 2014 but do not lift off until the low underlying is that it's consistent with a range of views even as the unemployment rate comes down the spotlight, and I think that's a very standard reaction function for policy rather than the single threshold that we've been relying on. In my forecast, we reach second half of 2015, and that delay reflects in part, in my forecast, the very inflation pressures.  So one of the statement's virtues on why we may need highly accommodative policy quite a bit.

would describe the risks as 'more nearly balanced.'  I SEP responses.  In paragraph 2, I can support the new language in blue that And, finally, in paragraph 2, I think that's consistent with what people said around the table and with the terms of the inflation language in President Evans so passionately spoke about.

I had dinner outside of the city at this table, and, after dinner, a rabbit ran in front of guy.  I got exactly what I wanted-alternative B.'  What I mean first, as you know, I've long been in favor of reducing the asset purchases, in the first place.  Second, and very importantly, I think this alternative B opens the door for us to further define forward guidance as go through time.  That's the most important thing that we can provide.  It separates the two, of articulating our forward guidance in what seems to me to be a more going to make a couple of I want to make a general comment with regard to the I support alternative B. MR.

I don't expect to get more, but digest we've done so far, and that is that there I have a simple statement and feeling about what is ample fuel sitting on the sidelines for businesses to take and drive our employment numbers

also think there is ample fuel to keep a floor on inflation.  I do take to heart President points that have been made.  Again, I would like to remind President that, even though inflation is below 2 percent, for seven months we've seen trimmed mean calculation of the CPI and PCE.  That encourages me to see, as you pointed out.  To me, price consumers, but we'll have to monitor that as we go through time.

Stating that the funds rate will remain in its current also a date-based commitment and ignore other key factors that must necessarily influence the I purchases range well past when the 6½ percent threshold is reached may intend to signal patience on the Committee's part.  But as President Kocherlakota noted in his memo, the language may imply Committee's decisionmaking in future meetings about the funds rate liftoff and path.

timing of liftoff and path for the well as indicates that the liftoff is likely to occur well after the 6½ percent the press conference and would seem 'well past,' which may convey that rates will remain low for longer than markets already anticipate or in which the SEP forecast for the funds rate may not be entirely consistent with the 'well past' language, resulting in The SEP already provides guidance about the likely funds rate, as threshold is hit.  This point could be articulated at preferable to changing thresholds or using new language such as a quasi-commitment result in tension between the message in the statement and the SEP, as we've experienced before. We could well face circumstances at future meetings and unemployment rate

I see this approach, as providing the flexibility the Committee will need to adjust policy as the economy environment, as well as eliminating the risk of Instead of wrestling rate path, I estimate of the funds rate from the SEP into the FOMC statement.

I really hash that out.  So threshold is probably forward guidance. precision.  I think we have well enough established a precedent at this point that our programs and our actions are data adopted in late 2011.  I think this is very different than that.

I approach to me, a more realistic approach.  I like President Also, there is a collection of editing suggestions, and I highlights among them.  Forgive me if Regarding the option in paragraph 2, that the downside risks have diminished versus risks are more nearly balanced, I just think the odds of growth coming in on one side or the other in my outlook are roughly the same, so it just seems like a better Plosser's fixed-size plan, but I agree that if we don't adopt it at this meeting we should maintain

But I don't think in train.  And I more felicitous to make it clearly future tense there. MR. LACKER.  I paragraph 2.  I would prefer not to do this blue language.  I like the original language better.  It is not quite as anxious.  But if we are strongly suggest that we replace 'is moving' with 'moves.'  The 'is moving' suggests that we detect some increase in inflation that is in train.  And I'm not sure we do. around the Committee is that we expect, we hope, we believe it is in train, and the 'is moving' suggests that we think something is think it would be a little

The concern would be that whatever our step is now, that language might anything bigger in the sure if President Lockhart's or Williams's suggestions get around it.  I think President Williams's suggestion of deleting this is a measured step.  It sort of leaves it open whether the step we just took is measured or not. So I would support President Williams's suggestion there.  And I think I Lockhart's suggestion as well to change 'measured' to 'similar.' list of options to comment on.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Lacker, you confused me on that last comment.  I 'further measured steps' as the intermediate option.  If we take out 'further,' that would I think it less flexible.  So I'm not quite sure which way you want to go. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President view seem to give more flexibility.  But then you just said replace it with 'similar,' which makes measured steps'-but 'measured steps' harkens back to the 2004-06 sequence, and I you're right.  I'm sorry.

would like to comment on three alternative B.  The first has to do with the decision to reduce the flow of purchases at MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I aspects of

December 17-18, 2013

this meeting.  The asset purchases and the this forward guidance is unduly imprecise, and I will offer some consensus to taper at this meeting and the implications of that decision for our longerstrategy statement. this meeting.  My recommendation will be that the Committee not taper at second aspect has to do with the nature of forward guidance regarding fed funds rate.  I believe suggestions on how to fix this deficiency.  And, finally, I will talk about what appears to be a growing run goals and policy found yesterday's conversation about I think there is a lack of agreement among the means for the horizon a consensus around the as inflation is eventually to get back to target, maybe over a 5- to 10-year an acceptable outcome.  In fact, President Fisher suggested that as So let me first talk about the decision to taper.  I inflation extremely interesting and informative. Committee about what our longer-run goals and policy strategy statement over which we are trying to return inflation to target.  There seemed to be table that as long horizon, that was certainly long as inflation is staying constant over time that's an acceptable outcome.

I had been interpreting the statement.  I think that that about the length of the horizon we have for returning inflation to its target is shared I think it matters for what their perceptions of interest rates are and how they think about how we are trying to provide accommodation to the Inflation has been falling over the past two are certainly measures of labor market improvement one can point to, but the prime-age workers has been essentially constant over the two years and, really, essentially constant over the past four years. So that was different from the way uncertainty by the public.  And it matters. going to be economy.  So what is the situation we are in now? years.  There employment-to-population ratio for past and I think is shared by many around the table, is that for many years to come.  In this context, a The staff's outlook, which I share inflation is going to be below the 2 percent target

December 17-18, 2013

a tiny amount-it doesn't matter what the amount is-all of these about are tiny in terms of the impact.  If you re-feed it through the model, are all tiny in terms of the impact on the economy.  It is the signaling component that FOMC views highly appropriate, even if those inflation shortfalls are low employment.  I think that will be an important source of news to consequences for the spending decisions of households and firms, as well as possibly decision to taper, even by amounts we're talking they matters.  And a decision to taper, even by $5 billion, signals that the persistent inflation shortfalls as being accompanied by unusually the public and to markets about the way we view our inflation goals and mandate.  And I think that communication could lead to sharp increases in fed funds futures and long-term yields, with significant to declines in inflation expectations.

I just said is by any means a certainty.  But I think one of the principles you're close to a decision about whether to tighten or not, basically the rule of you can't really protect any event, I think the signal we are going to be sending is that we are very years to come, and actually that I heard yesterday.  And I think that will be a source of surprise to I don't think what of operating at the zero lower bound is, when you do the kind of risk calculation that President Evans went through very carefully, if the zero lower bound should always push you toward not doing it.  That is operating at the zero lower bound, because of all the downside risks yourself against.  In comfortable with inflation remaining below 2 percent for many seems consistent with what markets and to the public.  So I would recommend against tapering at this time.

B is insufficiently precise.  Mr. Chairman, in September 2012, we made a goals for the asset purchase has meant that every Let me now turn to the issue of forward guidance.  My theme is that the forward guidance of alternative conscious decision not to be quantitatively specific about our program.  I think that lack of specificity has been a real problem for us.  It

December 17-18, 2013

valuable anchor for policy expectations course of a highly uncertain 2013. action and communication, no matter how small, has had large effects on market and public expectations about the eventual size of the program.  In contrast, our specificity in December 2012 with the fed funds rate has been an incredibly during the you want to be thinking about forward guidance Lacker suggested that this is not calendar-based guidance in 'well past the time' sounds like calendar-based guidance to me, but maybe I'm I would propose using explicitly state-based guidance instead, making reference waiting for a particular signal of labor market improvement.  I would prefer waiting until the unemployment rate has fallen below 6 percent, basically I suggested some compromise language in my memo, which is about time, talking about a change in conditions where we could keep the fed I think that that lesson really pushes how going forward.  I made some suggestions along these lines in my memo from last Friday.  In terms of the fed funds rate, President paragraph 5, but misreading it. to the fact that we're what's in alternative A, lowering the threshold.  But instead of talking funds rate extraordinarily low until the unemployment rate has fallen below 6½ percent and the medium-term inflation outlook has returned to 2 percent.

specific forward guidance in alternative A.  I think this kind of is likely to prove extremely complicated for us to manage, as our guidance about the asset purchase program in September 2012 has proven challenging for I have suggested in my memo, to the inclusion of a financial I think that is transparency in action.  I think that's going to be a factor the Committee's decisionmaking going forward, and we should be statements are.  And I will come back to that and policy strategy statement in a few seconds. Again, I prefer the more vague guidance in alternative B vague us to manage.  I am open, as stability knockout clause. that is going to influence open about that, more open I think than our current when I talk about the longer-run goal

December 17-18, 2013

I suggested in the memo from last Friday that the Committee reach a collective It doesn't seem we're tightening or easing to be in there.  And I think it's going to risk losing all going out saying different things about whether or not them.  I think that is going to really confuse the public about given meeting.  So I would have counseled including as to whether or not this decision is intended to increase, decrease, or keep Finally, answer to the question about whether we're tightening or easing at this meeting. like there is much consensus for reaching that consensus.  I think people want that ambiguity about whether public confidence.  We have 17 voices we were taking the first step to restoring normalization, with the associated tightening of financial market conditions.  Others have said, no, this is intended to keep financial market conditions constant, or perhaps ease what the Committee is trying to do at every a collective answer accommodation constant.  But it seems like there is little stomach for that at this meeting.

close by talking about our longer-run goals and policy strategy statement.  It sense of the Committee is that we will taper at this meeting.  I don't believe this strategy I mean is that anticipated slow rate of will suggest to the public, that factors goals are affecting our actions. Let me seems like the decision is readily rationalized in light of our current longer-run goals and policy statement.  The outlook for both prices and employment is too low-and what progress is very slow on both dimensions, especially on the inflation dimension, but employment as well.  Why are we removing a tool of accommodation, given that progress?  That decision suggests to me, and I think it other than our outlook for progress toward our about the benefits of transparency in your leadership of this Committee, and I your successor's leadership.  As you noted, it's especially Mr. Chairman, you spoke eloquently on Monday monetary policymaking.  This has been a hallmark of expect it will be a hallmark of essential for us to be transparent about our objectives in the making of policy.  If today's

December 17-18, 2013

I think one of them is financial stability concerns tools, frankly-then I think we need to be explicit about those concerns strategy statement.  If that is going to be an important part of making of policy, we should be telling the public that as opposed to choices.  And I will have decision suggests that we are taking into account considerations other than the outlook for inflation and unemployment-and I think it's a little hard for me to quite get my arms around what those other considerations are, but associated with both our in our longer-run goals and policy our consideration in the leaving them uncertain about what it is that actually is informing policy more to say about this in January.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

couple of interesting I am going to have to address them in a few hours, let me try a couple of CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota, you raise a questions.  And since answers.

we are tightening policy, we say, in the first sentence of 'reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of encourage participants to say externally that we are you think about the components, on the one hand, we are still going to sheet, and the total amount of assets that we will buy and hold is higher than was anticipated either in September 2012 or in June 2013.  On the other that is trying essentially to preserve market expectations rough approximation of the intent of this action is to try to keep First, on whether or not paragraph 5 that the Committee monetary policy will remain appropriate.'  I not intending a meaningful tightening of policy, that we are trying to maintain a highly accommodative policy.  If be adding to the balance probably hand, obviously, we have this guidance about rates.  So I think a accommodation reasonably close to where it is now.

I think are toward tightening, at least in the short run, for a number of you Now, the risks reasons.  One reason in particular is that people, as they did in the summer, may take, as

December 17-18, 2013

I think one thing I am going to try to emphasize is that abandoned accommodative policy and that we want to maintain a high level of in particular, I will try to reinforce the progress we have made in separating the said, a signal that we are June that we were doing that if, in fact, that problem we have not accommodation; asset purchases and the rate guidance.

your question, which I think is very good, and I have been spending of our longer-run goals and policy strategy statement.  And the way I would say it is as a supplemental tool was to a sustainable improvement in the outlook for the labor market.  We think we and now we believe that we can achieve guidance.  Now, that we would consider I put these out there as a review for anyone has any suggestions to make the answers better, or The other part of some hours when I should have been sleeping thinking about it, is how do we explain this in the context something like the following:  The Committee views asset purchases because it believes that, as the balance sheet expands, the benefit-cost ratio essentially is likely to go down because of the difficulties of managing a large balance sheet and the risks of exiting from a large balance sheet.  Consequently, what the Committee did from the beginning explicitly state an objective for this program, which was not maximum employment and price stability; it was have achieved that.  We have made that progress, similar levels of accommodation using the continuing purchases plus our may not be true, in which case we will have to come back, and I hope that additional measures if in fact things do tighten unduly.  But my press conference.  If disagreements, I'd be happy to hear them.

Without it being in the Committee's own statement, more ambiguity than not. accommodation is intended to remain the same, that we are intending to keep financial conditions the same-I think it's extremely helpful.  But I think there is ambiguity I'm misreading it. accomplish.  But it's very

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You don't think the first sentence in paragraph 5 gives the general thrust of that?

I think that the tendency of financial market participants in is to ignore sentences that are the same as in prior statements, so it's focus on.  So I think there's a limited amount of comfort in that. different from the fed as well as one powerful right now that you've got inflation trending Well, you must find this to be a very scary tool if same flow.'  I'm sure you have a good answer prepared your answers, it's a question of what the mindset will be of the MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. reading these statements really the changes that they That's a very articulate explanation of why we see asset purchases as being funds rate, and I could not hope to do better myself, so I think you've done possibly could on that dimension.  The issue is that our actions are very powerful, more than any one person's words can be.  I think the question that will come up is, 'Boy, do you really see asset purchases as being that costly downward and unemployment still elevated? you're not willing to keep using it at the for that, but it's not a question of people receiving the signal through our action.

That statement is operative different policies.  I think that the way that you will express it will be genuine, but you can imagine that some people would react to it and say, 'Well, policy.  But, we know monetary policy that you can easily say highly accommodative policy even when the funds rate starts to go up to 1 percent,' can measure it against what for a very wide range of understood as you know, it's not the strongest statement.'

I just wanted to put something on the go around the rest of the discussion here, which is, just eliminate 'in further 'the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases at future get locked into the measured-pace language of 2004Lacker noted.  Thank you. MR. BULLARD.  Mr. Chairman, I'm sensing on this issue about 'in further measured steps' table as we measured steps' and say meetings.'

MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B with the changes you've proposed.

policy remarks with the statement, 'I did not find today's call.'  I can repeat those words today.  I suppose that existential angst first move to taper would not be very important, but in the current In September, I began my policy decision an easy over our initial tapering decision is simply unavoidable.  Were it not for signaling considerations, the precise timing of our

December 17-18, 2013

unprecedented environment, the signal we'll be sending is both very important and very difficult to assess.

I noted in the economy go-round, since the inception of the purchase payroll gains has been running near 200,000 year now without any sign of a letup.  We've also seen clearer signs of a reduced downside risks to the I've long harbored about the sustainability of I now feel comfortable with On the merits, as program we've seen meaningful progress in the labor market based on a wide range of indicators, and current data reveal that the pace of per month for an entire pickup in final demand since September, and with fiscal policy at home apparently now on a less disruptive course and Europe slowly pulling out of recession, I see economic outlook.  For these reasons, the doubts progress in the labor market have finally subsided to the point where the first modest reduction in the pace of purchases.

Nevertheless, as President Kocherlakota noted, as long respond to downside than upside shocks, so the overall risks facing the economy remain weighted to the downside.

But it also emphasizes that the course of asset purchases remains contingent on both the labor confess I'm quite uncertain how financial markets will appear to be convinced that a taper is coming, I expect our decision will therefore come as something of a surprise, and to June, a considerable time.

[Coffee break]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  I think we're ready to recommence.  Governor Tarullo.

you, Mr. Chairman.  As the discussion yesterday obviously for the proposition that the standard that we set in MR. TARULLO.  Thank showed, there's a reasonable case to be made September of 2012 is at least in the process of being met, which is to say that we're seeing

December 17-18, 2013

certain ironic twist to the qualification that we inserted on that standard-'in a context extending the program. substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.  As the Chairman noted yesterday, there's a of price stability'-which I think most people believed would be a possible grounds for truncating the program, and at this juncture, it's actually an argument for

B but, as with many of you, for a somewhat complicated set of I'll now try to explain.  I think that there is some risk, as people have already said, going to have to pay.  The odds of it I don't think that, as many of you have observed, consensus around this as a likely date for tapering as opposed to one of the next couple The data have helped us some.  Our own communication probably hasn't.  As I transcript for the last meeting, I noted that many of us spent a lot of time talking I say, the data have done some of the work for us. I do favor alternative reasons that that there may be some roiling in the markets.  I think that is quite possible whenever we taper, particularly because of the fact that there will be movement on certain issues with certain maturities, and that's just inevitable and a price that we're are probably a little bit higher now because there's a of meetings. looked at the about how to set up market expectations for the taper, and we really haven't done much of that. But, as arguments for waiting, as Eric and Charlie Evans and Narayana have all, I argued.  I don't think the costs would rise that much waiting a few months. Narayana good point about the zero lower bound.  Additionally, we would have a better chance were ready to end.  There could be a I in Charlie There are good think, persuasively We'd have a better chance of avoiding the possibility of having to reverse course. makes the of being in a position where we were quite certain that we very strong presumption in financial markets as opposed to the sort of moderate presumption that we'll probably include today.  Because there are these uncertainties that people have identified, don't think we're in a position to provide the maximum kind of clarity that is explicit

December 17-18, 2013

recommendation, which I was conceptually attracted to at the last meeting, but I was Plosser's attracted to it in the context of a pretty high level of assurance about the initial taper.

we were going to taper as a I think we can we're doing today as beginning the end of the LSAP process rather than explained, there is some over the course of the next several months.  I I think it's probably worth making the point, though, which I don't think anybody has made yet today, that while we've got a reasonable case that the standard has been met, in September 2012, we did not explicitly, at least, include the idea that way of ending the program.  It could have been read as binary, and in that respect fairly characterize what actually ending the LSAP process.  And, as people have already optionality in that depending on data that we see think it is one way to square some of the tensions in the various positions and statements we've made along the way.

you can see that, to this point at least, my instincts would lean more with Narayana as a Committee.  While there are going to be some communication problems that you have already mentioned, and that the Chairman is going to have to start confronting course of the next several months yet there is a Well, and Eric, but like Charlie Evans, I tried to look at the situation that we actually confront collectively many of in a few hours, we definitely run the risk of having another communication problem if things do not improve or things backslide over the continued strong view amongst some members of the Committee to want to begin to taper.

making for doing so, and I agree with that proposition.  I disagree a little bit with what Narayana LSAP program back in September 2012.  I don't as much in the generality of the standards put forth as in, as I've said a consensus within the Committee for what we are I think Jim Bullard said that it was good to taper at a moment when the data were the case said about the problem in the articulation of the think the problem lay before, the fact that there really wasn't

December 17-18, 2013

tension privately but not publicly ever since. LSAP program regarded, as I think it should be, as having promoted the goals that we B today. actually doing, and we have been living with that And for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is the coherence of Committee action, I think it's a good thing that we try to maintain as much of a focus on performance of the economy and on having the set forth for it.  And so for that set of reasons, I do support alternative the language, I think it is important to make the language modifications, the blue language about signaling right have not collectively taken a hawkish turn.  I actually a number of reasons for yes, some of which I've already detailed, an additional reason to vote yes is I don't the language as amended in red and blue that was circulated this With respect to including the forward-guidance modifications that have been suggested and that was inserted at Charlie's suggestion.  As Narayana said, this is largely now, and it is important, I think, to signal that we don't think we have.  There continue to be different views, but looked at collectively, I don't think the Committee is in a different position today than it was in October or September or probably, for that matter, June.  In fact, I will say that although there are me to vote want a dissent of mine to be regarded as my perception that the Committee has taken a hawkish turn.  So I am in favor of morning to the Committee.

anything more about that.  I'll just end with two couple of you in the course of the conversation that don't go I thought were worth considering.  One is Esther's suggestion SEP medians, including the federal funds rate agree with that, in principle.  I do think though that if we're going to do it, this is we really do need to start thinking about distinguishing between voting and nonvoting I think we saw yesterday, is somewhat limited when I don't think there's a need to say observations that were raised by a directly to this decision today, but that it may be useful to publish some of the information.  I where members because the information value, as

December 17-18, 2013

go in this direction, we might want to think about year and next year and those are presumably would give the right kind of information for the people who are going to year.  But if we're going to move there, let's do it in a way that allows markets to predict how the Committee might react in a certain circumstance. one looks at all 17 participants.  If we publishing the median for people who vote this somewhat different; that be voting next better my skepticism about a number of meetings, including the one today. more to say about that in January.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And then finally, Narayana in his remarks mentioned the longer-run goals and policy strategy document, which will be coming up again in January.  I must say that exercise has been somewhat reinforced over Like Narayana, I'll have

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Stein.

As a couple of other messaging, I think it's an opportune time to full we wait till March, there's just the risk that even if things are generally continuing to get and then it's a little bit awkward, and you understand that that's just noise, the message, I think, gets a little trickier.  You size of the balance an issue.  So I think now we've been basically dealt a reasonably good good time to play it. MR. STEIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B. people have noted, I think just purely in terms of taper.  Recent news has been positive, and doing it now allows us to come across with a relatively upbeat message.  We're doing it because the outlook has improved, more or less stop.  If better, you get a bad labor market report the week before then even if can let March pass, but then there's sort of accumulated discomfort with the sheet becoming more of hand in terms of messaging.  So I think it's a

The first is the extent of the funds rate path that we set out, and the second is the nature of paragraph 5.  Let me start with the guidance.  I think it's I'd like to just briefly touch on two other issues: predictability of the presumptive the forward-guidance enhancement in

December 17-18, 2013

component of the guidance.  The market until something like mid or late 2015.  This seems like a policy objectives, Mr. Chairman, for the you laid out yesterday having to do with a change in our point estimate of the natural to strengthen the absolutely appropriate to strengthen the pre-liftoff seems to expect liftoff to be delayed reasonable expectation.  It seems like it serves our reasons that rate.  All of that, I think, points in the direction of wanting to do something guidance.

I actually quite like the paragraph 5 about maintaining the target range for the funds rate well a calendar-based enhancement on top of the economic conditionality.  I guess it's It's a little bit of a mix and match, but I think it strikes a good balance in terms reasonable risk-management I said, I was a little uncomfortable with moving the unemployment not because it's the wrong thing in the modal scenario-I think it's aligns correctly, we will lift percent or something like that, and that's all that I was concerned about.  So I think the And then comes the question of what is the best way to do that. language that we have in past the time the unemployment threshold is crossed.  I acknowledge it is calendar-based.  It's clearly sort of a little awkward. of doing what we want to do, on the one hand, and having some properties, on the other.  As threshold to 6.0 percent, but just about right in the modal scenario.  I think if everything kind of off in mid-2015.  Unemployment will be around 6 great, but there's sort of this long tail of outcomes people who were involved in drafting the statement did a very nice job.

approach would be to do something along the lines of what Narayana and have a knockout of some sort for financial stability.  I'm sympathetic, and to have a stronger, a risk putting it in in midstream where, if you all of a sudden call attention to it, An alternative suggested certainly if we were starting from scratch, I think I would have been happy more fully developed financial-stability knockout, as the Bank of England has done.  I think there's a bit of

December 17-18, 2013

you hit 6.5 I think there is some risk that it would actually unhinge the guidance a little bit.  I people might say, 'Geez, you think you might even hit that knockout before percent?'  So think we're probably in a better place with what we have.

issue of how much clarity or determinism we put in the path of asset purchases, I to and appreciate the arguments that Dennis and Charlie and others made for a I won't repeat their arguments.  I think they're basically helpful.  I going to go all the way there now, and it's sort of too much to throw out data On the am sympathetic relatively deterministic path. recognize we're not dependence entirely.

a relatively clear path, which is I clear path can become quite a powerful complement to our forward That is to say, suppose you make it pretty clear that we're going to have this path, and glide path.  So it's $10 billion a meeting.  If you do that, it takes eight meetings to get done.  By then we're at the end of 2014 or pretty close, and it's meeting or two to even really begin thinking about lifting off after that. I did want to point to another selling point for having think that having a relatively guidance. by the way, it's a relatively slow basically going to take us another you get people in the market thinking about it, then in a very mechanical you have more or less pushed out the date until mid-2015.  So I think there's a virtue above virtues that you alluded to, but it kind of hinges on it being a relatively going to go to a fully path at this meeting, but I tend to like the pieces of the language that I think serve I like 'further measured steps' because it has a little bit of that with the suggestion I would be in favor of doing something like that.  Again, I don't think it takes If that's the way way and beyond some of the slow path.  So I think that that's worth having.  I don't think that we're deterministic that purpose.  So on the specifics, feeling of doing it slowly and semi-deterministically.  I would go along Charlie had of changing the words 'if incoming information' to 'so long as incoming information.'

a larger area of inaction, which I think is sort of a away data dependence, but it creates reasonable thing.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Powell.

prepared to go ahead with alternative B Payroll levels are 1.5 million higher than almost a full percentage point lower than expected and, as I good hand of cards on that front. up, and inflation that time to our 2 percent objective.  In addition, our reasons for not tapering addressed. MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am today.  In my view, the decision to reduce purchases is well justified, as can be seen in the comparison of labor market conditions to those that prevailed in September 2012 and to those that the Committee expected to prevail today. expected.  Unemployment is mentioned yesterday, and others mentioned as well, the trailing payroll numbers are in good shape for 3-, 6-, and 12-month levels.  So it is, in fact, a pretty The decision is also justified under the framework that the Chairman articulated at the June meeting.  We have continued progress in the labor market, growth picking is forecast to return over in September-weaker data and the fiscal negotiations-have been first of which is timing, and for me the the inflation forecast in connection with this decision.  So on the first, on timing, I argued that we needed three things to taper before March:  strong incoming of the fiscal negotiations, and communications from the core much on the table.  So got the first two done, and I thought that the third element would be virtually But I have to admit we've gotten there.  Through a sequence of events, All of that said, I struggle with two concerns, the question then is taper now or wait until the March meeting, and the second is inflation and how to think about at the last meeting data, a successful conclusion members of the FOMC that signaled that the December meeting was very we absolutely impossible to satisfy, and that was the basis for my confident prediction that we would not be able to taper until March.

December 17-18, 2013

at one of the next three meetings.  But it's not fully would see a taper as fully justified based on the that the decision to move at this meeting rather than one of the later expectations only in a time sense.  It's a surprise.  It's probably a tiny others, I don't see that reaction, and it ought to settle down in a few days.  And the Chairman will the meeting there is no intended hawkish surprise here.  So I'm going ahead from a timing standpoint. we've gotten to a place where it's expected anticipated, although I do believe that the market Chairman's framework, based on the improvement in labor market conditions.  So the content is not a surprise.  It's really meetings is ahead of hawkish surprise, and I expect there will be a reaction in the market.  Like it ought to be a major communicate strongly at comfortable with as inflation is concerned, we are obviously in a very difficult place.  The forecast factors that send no important signal about slack, I don't think I see that as a basis for As far is for a slow return to 2 percent, and there really is no expectation in the forecast of notably higher inflation in the short term.  So if inflation goes sideways for a while and is mainly held down by pausing the taper.

the statement, I think that the new blue language in paragraph 4 gets it exactly right.  It's about the outlook for inflation.  The inclusion of actually think that the language at the end of paragraph 2, 'inflation is leaves me a little bit uneasy because there really isn't much back in the next couple of meetings.  So I points become a trend, and I don't think it's I see that as a concern. Going to the language in of alternative B inflation there will be seen as a signal, and it's about the outlook.  I think that kind of has it exactly right.  And I moving back toward its objective,' of an expectation that we will see inflation moving wonder whether that doesn't create some uncertainty around the path of purchases in the near term.  As John indicated, one or two or three data intended that way, but some may see it and it may create uncertainty.  So

December 17-18, 2013

of page 6.  As written, that page is quite I think it's a good It creates a fair amount of certainty.  One or two more tapers, it's going to create a lot could live with strengthening it, and I think maybe we look at that to see if we could become more deterministic in terms of both the time and the comfortable with this.  In my own forecast, liftoff actually happens just 6 percent, and so I think this gives a strong indication of where we are without giving That's it on the statement.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In terms of the other language, I do really like all good.  I like the original language, 'in further measured steps,' because balance. of confidence in our path.  I over time amount.  I mentioned I like the blue language.  In terms of the language for after hitting 6½ percent, I'm very after we hit away discretion for free.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.

I begin to reduce the pace of asset purchases at this meeting.  My growth growth, and we do expect that, rightly or wrongly, it go into 2014, and Congress seems to be losing some of its fiscal shenanigans.  Thus, I think we can truly say that we have seen conditions, which would suggest driven by efficacy and cost considerations rather than by success.  The now.  So I think we should move forward. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B. think the time has come to motivation for doing so is straightforward.  We've seen better data, a somewhat firmer trajectory, and stronger payroll employment will continue.  Also, we should be somewhat more confident about this than in the past because the fiscal drag is diminishing as we appetite for further significant improvement in the labor market and that we expect that this improvement in the labor market outlook will be substantial by the time the purchase program has been completed. This is far preferable to beginning the taper in more ambiguous that the taper was being conditions are satisfactory

December 17-18, 2013

risks to doing this?  Certainly.  Two risks come to mind.  First, we will us to not begin to taper at this meeting.  This leads to two potential less credibility for us and potentially a view that we are inclined to remove policy compelling.  On the credibility side, I don't think we lose much by After all, there is a strong consensus that we will move sometime soon, FOMC meeting.  It just can't make that much difference if it's Now, are there once again wrong foot market participants a bit.  As Simon noted, the majority of respondents on the dealer survey expect problems: accommodation more quickly than anticipated, which could lead to an undesirable tightening of financial market conditions.  Although I think this set of risks is real, I think the arguments for moving though are more moving at this meeting. almost certainly by the March now, January, or March.

good case for moving now based on our own criterion, and market March than on this meeting, there was a recent survey of asked them, what are your preferences?  What would you do?  And by a to 46 percent, those economists said that they would start at this meeting, we moved at this meeting relatively easily.  Even in September when we by not tapering, people understood the motivation pretty quickly. Also, there's a participants actually do seem to understand this.  While the bulk of expectations is more on January and Wall Street Journal economists, where they majority of 49 percent which I think is sort of interesting.  So that suggests to me that people should be able to get their arms around why surprised people

I think there are a couple of factors here that should mitigate our concerns.  First, are doing a much better On the action being perceived as more hawkish and leading to a tightening of financial conditions that we'd want to avoid, that's not only a risk, but it probably will occur to some degree.  But unlike the case prior to the September meeting, market participants now job of distinguishing between the decision to taper and the decision to raise short-term interest

December 17-18, 2013

clearly in the markets.  The September 2015 Eurodollar futures about 80 basis points lower in yield even though the 10-year Treasury September meeting.  So short-term interest rate don't think what we're going to do today is $10 billion, and the future steps in terms of tapering will likely be of similar should the forecast evolve as we expect.  Of course, there is going to be some residual rates, and you can see that very contract today is currently yield is about the same level as it was prior to the expectations are much better anchored.  Second, I going to disturb those expectations very much.  The initial taper is small, at forward guidance implies that magnitude uncertainty about this until the January meeting, and obviously if we do $10 billion in January we'll remove much of that residual uncertainty.

guidance with respect to the unemployment rate in this statementbelow 6½ percent'-should also, I our SEP projections. you look at Friday's close, the December 2016 Eurodollar futures yield was 2.14 percent. I think the reaction is going to be modest.  My best guess is there will be a pretty initially in the stock and bond market, but I think the markets will stabilize Also, the forward 'well past the time that the unemployment rate declines think, help pin down those expectations.  That said, there will probably be some rise in forward interest rates because the curve today is somewhat below what's implied by So if That's pretty low relative to the numbers that we're showing in the SEP, especially when you consider that that 2.14 percent is a mean, not a mode, and so that tends to bias the difference a little bit.  But sharp selloff relatively quickly.

going to take a risk going to see that the taper starts.  They're going to have a good sense of how it's going to proceed.  Also, we have to recognize that the yield curve rates are already priced in as you look beyond The important thing to remember here is that our actions are actually event off the table.  So people are now pretty is already very steep so that much higher forward

December 17-18, 2013

years.  The rate on the five-year, five-year forward Treasury note is about close to what you would think it would be in sort of So it seems to me that the market is already anticipating a fully normalized environment if you look out five years. the next couple of 4¼ percent, which seems to me like pretty the steady state. interest rate care about how monetary policy affects I think we really want to make it clear that if financial conditions going to very much take this into consideration in terms of our future could pause, we could reduce the pace more rapidly, or we could take the pace on how the economy performs and the outlook changes.  So there's a I don't think we want to take our discretion off the table Now, if the selloff is more substantial than I expect, then I think it is going to be very important for us to remind people that we do ultimately financial conditions, and tighten unduly, we're decisions.  I think it's important that market participants understand that with respect to the pace of purchases we back up again depending presumption of this glide path, but should the economy behave differently than anticipated.

really don't favor this idea of announcing a total expected size of the remaining done seems to very much contradict what's come I also don't favor reducing the unemployment rate threshold from 6½ percent.  I think rate figure is a threshold and not a trigger; it's you look at the dealer survey, most people expect the time of liftoff to be you were to reduce the threshold in that manner, I think it would be doubling reliable.  So why would you want to put more I program.  To me that completely contradicts everything that we've done up to now.  Up to now, we've been basically saying the program is data dependent.  So then to announce that we're going to do just this much more and we're before. people already understand that the unemployment interesting that if around a 6 percent unemployment rate.  So I'm not sure what problem we're trying to solve. Also I think if down on a parameter that hasn't been particularly

December 17-18, 2013

good guide in terms of our emphasis on a single unemployment rate, which has not been a very decision weighing up to this point?

as the language is concerned, I'm less concerned about inflation than many other To restate what I said yesterday, we don't really have a coherent of it seems to be due to special factors, but given that, I can accept the changes in paragraphs 2 and 4 of alternative B that are proposed paragraph 2, I prefer the red as having become I'm happy to agree with President Fisher to take out the language 'since purchase program' in paragraph 2.  I don't think it's really necessary.  I as to the most you don't put that in there, all you're going to do is encourage a lot of people to you're going to do at the January meeting.  I gradual, and I think that's important because I think it As far members of the Committee. story about why inflation is low right now.  A lot even in blue that sort of emphasize the inflation part of the story.  In language-'the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market more nearly balanced.' the inception of the asset would keep the word 'further' in paragraph 4.  I think it provides more guidance likely path.  If ask the Chairman a lot of questions about what think it implies that the path is likely to be will also help pin down expectations about the timing of liftoff in terms of short-term interest rates.

couple of words on communication.  We can make this as a Committee or work poorly, and I think it's really important as we go forward that we study what to harken back to that as much as possible in that the Committee achieving success.  I think we can what we do today if we all talk with different voices, litigating what the $10 billion at the Finally, just a work well the Chairman says in his press conference and try terms of our communication.

So I would just encourage to be as close to the Chairman's press because I think if the Committee speaks with one be in our favor in terms of generating the outcomes that we want in terms of financial Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I don't think there are too many decision points on the alternative B statement.  I pretty clear preference for the balanced risks and the labor market as having become more SEP, which had only one or two to the CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Thanks, everyone.  A lot of interesting discussion, but think in alternative B, paragraph 2 there was a option-'risks to the outlook for the economy nearly balanced.'  This is very consistent with the downside-what is it, Matt?

MR. LUECKE.  Two to the downside.

I think people are Let me just ask President Evans-'inflation 'is likely to move' or something like that or 'will move'-'evidence that inflation CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Two to the downside, otherwise is amenable, I think I would be happy to accept President Fisher's suggestion to strike 'since the inception of the asset purchase program,' because willing to accept the blue language in paragraph 2. is moving'-I think is defensible.  You could also say something like 'is in the process of moving' or will move back.'

LACKER. It says 'will monitor.' MR.

MR. EVANS.  'Will move back' or 'in the process' is fine.  Something actionable- CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  'Will move'?

MR. STEIN.  'Will move' is a little better, I think.

December 17-18, 2013

I mean, the fact that it's got MR. EVANS.  Yes.  We're monitoring whether it will move. 'monitor' in it makes it just pretty unobjectionable, it seems to me-'will monitor inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back'-yes, that's all right.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.

Is that all right?

I'm okay with 'will move.' VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

MR. LACKER.  Mr. Chairman-

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.

LACKER. It says we 'will monitor . . . for evidence that inflation will move back.'

MR. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.

How inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move.'

MR. EVANS.  Yes, that's fine.

MR. LACKER.  Yes, that's good.

other thing that a number of suggestions for the language about some that made it more rigid and some that made it less In trying to think about answering questions at the press conference, I think 'further I think it does actually in practice bow toward a fairly steady sequence of events CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Did you get that, Matt?  All right.  The only I think I would raise at this point, there were 'further measured steps.'  There were rigid. measured steps'-it says, first of all, that this was a measured step, so it is suggesting that subsequent steps will be $10 billion, $15 billion, something like that.  President Plosser may not agree, but

December 17-18, 2013

flexibility.  So having 'further' and 'farther,' and so on, I think I would prefer to keep it as it unless, of course, there is some change in the outlook, which then gives us thought very hard about is.

MR. PLOSSER.  Mr. Chairman- CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.

I about changing 'if' to as.'  I don't know if there is anyMR. PLOSSER.  I actually am open to 'further measured steps' at this point.  But would like to consider the suggestion I made and Governor Stein made 'as long an overreaction, a hawkish to 'as long as.'  But is there a strong sense about this? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I'm just nervous about overreaction

DUDLEY.  I'd prefer 'if' because I just don't think we want to VICE CHAIRMAN prejudge the future.

I prefer 'if.' MR. EVANS.

I think we will make it purely contingent.  I good reason. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right. think, again, in practice, President Plosser, I think that there is pretty much a presumption here that this will happen unless there is some you MR. PLOSSER.  Well, you can add some strength to that in your press conference if can.

I have CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think it will be evident.  So I think that's it, unless missed something.  All right.  Matt, would you like to summarize the changes?
