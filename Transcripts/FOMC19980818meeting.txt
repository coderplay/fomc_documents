MR.  FISHER.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. I  will e  referring    the ackage  of olor b to p c charts, ich should e  on  the able  n ront  f ou. wh b t i f o y 1/

The first ge  as  usual hows  the -month  deposit  ates:  urrent, month pa s 3 r c 3forward,  nd  9-month  forward. ince  your  last  eeting,  here  ave  been  small ut a S m t h b noteworthy hanges  in  interest  te  xpectations.   the nited  States, e op c ra e In U th t panel  in ed,  ou  can  see  that  he -month  forward -month  rate  as  slipped  elow r y t 9 3 h b the  current  -month  rate.  ven though  this  egative  ap  is mall--a zen  basis 3 E n g s do points r  so--it  he  widest n the  chart  ince he  January eriod.  hink t o ist o s t p It i reflects  growing  chorus f oices n  the arket,  articularly  the  last  0 days, a o v i m p in 1 who are  increasingly  nfident  hat  he ommittee's ext ove will e  an  easing co t t C n m b action.

In  the iddle  panel,  s  you  can  see,  he erman 9-month  forward -month m a t G 3 rate lso as  crept    little er  in ecent  eeks. I  think  t  till flects  e a h a low r w i s re th anticipation    an  increase  n uropean  rates  ometime  over he  coming  months.  I of i E s t believe  t  s articularly eworthy  hat  he -month  forward -month  rate s i i p not t t 9 3 i actually  rading  round evels  ust  bove  3.8  percent  here  most  people ust t a l j a w j a month ago  were expecting  he uropean  Central  ank's  1-month  policy ate  o e t E B r t b set ext  January. o,  that  eflects  ite    reduction  n xpectations er he ast n S r qu a i e ov t l couple f  months. o

In  the ottom  panel n  green, ou  can  see hat  oth  the  3-  and  9-month  forward b i y t b 3-month  rates  n  Japan  dropped  distinctly ow  the urrent  -month  rate  ollowing i bel c 3 f the  selection   the ew LDP  leadership am, ut  those ates  ecently ve  bounced of n te b r r ha back  up  a  bit.

As I  look t  the ast  4 months  of nterest  te  xpectations   the eading a l 1 i ra e in l industrial  tions, o  things  trike  e. First,  e urrent  repidation    global na tw s m th c t in capital  arkets s ot  a  consequence f  the erception  hat  he eading  entral  anks m i n o p t t l c b are  about o  do  anything.  here  is o  such  expectation. condly, t  trikes  how t T n Se i s me far arkets  have  come over  the ast  2 months  in  giving eight o he  risks  f m l 1 w t t o deflation,  wever  they magine  them  to e.  A year  ago  at  your  August  meeting, ho i b I introduced  y four haracters   pursuit  f  return, e ld  and  the  new paradigm m c in o a th o pessimists d  optimists.  t  the ime  I  introduced  he ew paradigm  pessimist  ho an A t t n w was anxious bout  deflation d  global apacity  lut  eading  o ompetitive a an c g l t c devaluations,  hink nly  Governor  Kelley  had  a  kind  word to  say  about he ew I  t o t n paradigm  pessimist  ho he  thought hould ot e  overlooked. w s n b

MS. RIVLIN.  He is  always  nice.  [Laughter]

MR. FISHER.  Today,  at  least  s  the arket  sees t,  he ation  ith  the econd a m i t n w s largest onomy in  the  world, apan, nd  the ation ith  the  largest are f  the ec J a n w sh o world's  otential bor upply,  hina, re oth  experiencing  istinctly ling ices. p la s C a b d fal pr Moreover,  the  premier f hina  is o  longer  orrying  about  maintaining e ace  of o C n w th p investment  n  order o  prevent  nflationary  ttlenecks. stead,   is ow talking i t i bo In he n about  how China  is rying  o nvest  ts  ay out  of  deflation.  s his  ontext  hat t t i i w Iti t c t I think e should eep  in  mind  in  our  effort   understand  ow the arkets re w k to h m a looking t  the  question  f hether hina  will evalue ts  urrency.   think  hat a o w C d i c I t implicitly  is  uestion  s een, ightly   wrongly, s  representing  mething f  a th q i s r or a so o turning  oint  or he arkets--from    world  they re  familiar th  to ne  they re ess p f t m a a wi o a l familiar  ith, hat  s,    deflationary  rld. w t i a wo

Turning  to  the econd  page  of harts,  the eft  ide re  three  anels howing s c on l s a p s foreign  quity  rices,  erman and  U.S.  equity  rices, d  German and  U.S.  10-  year e p G p an yields  ver  the eriod rom  last  uly o  the resent.  n the ight  and  side re hree o p f J t p O r h a t panels epicting  he ame market  movements since he eginning f uly  this  ear. d t s t b o J y Markets  have  gotten    little  ead  of e since    prepared  his  hart, t et  e  focus a ah m I t c bu l m on  the ight  and  side irst d  make a  point.    think  e can  see  in etrospect  at  he r h f an I w r th t combination f  the  Chairman's  umphrey-Hawkins testimony  his  uly  and  Mr. o H t J Obuchi's election   lead  the DP  were turning  oints  or lobal  arket s to L p f g m expectations. w, I  want  to  be  very  clear.  n  both  cases,  he utcomes  were as  the No I t o market  expected ut ot  as  the arket  hoped.  Market  participants e  engaging, b n m wer I believe,   some wishful hinking, ping  to  be  pleasantly rprised. in t ho su

With respect  o  the  Humphrey-Hawkins testimony,  he arket  was hoping  that t t m the  Chairman would  say  something ather  ind  and  benevolent.  nstead, ey eard r k I th h him say  exactly  hat  he  said  n  June  at is EC testimony, mely  that  e  was more w i h J na h concerned  about he  risks  f  inflation  an hose f  deflation,  d  they eard im t o th t o an h h testify  th  what  might  be  characterized    a  "make no  mistake bout t"  elivery. wi as a i d With  respect  o  the election  he DP  leadership d  the ew Japanese t s oft L an n government, gain  the arket  was hoping  to  be  pleasantly rprised,  inking  hat a m su th t perhaps  the apanese ould  find heir  wn FDR.  So far,  t oes  not ppear hat  hey J c t o i d a t t have.  Thus,  looking ack,   think  he  market's  wo  self-generated appointments b I t t dis can  be  seen  as  the ast  neezes n  which  the tart  he ecent  quity  arket  declines l s o s oft r e m might  be  blamed.

I  do  not ave  charts  epicting me of he arket  movements in  the ast  wo h d so t m l t days  that  eflect e ussian evaluation.  et  me just  ote  that  n  Friday oth  the r th R d L n o b German bund  market  and  our reasury arket  experienced  ome extraordinary T m s inflows. here  is till  flight  uality  nto oth ore  Europe  and  the nited tates. T s a toq i b c U S The details e  still  ming  out or he ussian evaluation  nd  debt estructuring ar co f t R d a r announced  yesterday. arket  assessments  re  that  he ussian  program  is etter, M a t R b at least  nsofar  s  can  be  judged n  the irst y  or  so, han  they ight  have  feared. i a i f da t m However,  I  think here  s  also   great eal f nxiety  bout ow trades  ill  e  settled, t i a d o a a h w b and  this  s ausing onsiderable rket  commotion. The ruble as fixed oday  at .8 i c c ma w t 6 to  the ollar, t  it  s rading  round ,  at east  n he  interbank rket.  But d bu i t a 7 l i t ma according  o  the eports  hat  e have, he uble  s lready  rading  round  9  in he t r t w t r i a t a t black arket.  I  do  not  pretend  o  understand, d  therefore m not  comfortable m t an I  a explaining, w it  s hat  he ow  thinks  his  s reat  ews while  the olsa  and  other ho i t t D t i g n B emerging  equity  arkets hink t  s ad  news. I  think e will ave  to  wait  a  few  days m t i i b w h to  see ow this  lays ut. h p o

I  would  note hat  he evaluation  he hai  baht ad  looked  pretty  ood  on  day t t d oft T h g 2  also.  hink e have  quite    few  risks  head  of s  particularly he  days  ahead It w a a u in  t when the  collateral  at  as  underpinned uch of he  leverage  n he ussian th h m t i t R financial rkets tarts  o  be  liquidated   counterparties ure  ut  what  trades  re ma s t as fig o a being  settled d  what  trades  re ot. here  is till reat  eal f ncertainty ere, an a n T s a  g d o u th but  I annot retend  o e  up  to  the inute  on these evelopments. c p t b m d

Turning  to he hird  age, ou  will  ee  three ifferent  arts  hat  epict  hanges t t p y s d ch t d c in  dollar  xchange  rates  ince uly 997. In  the op  panel ollar  xchange  rates, e s J 1 t d e indexed  to ast  uly,  re  shown against    number  of urrencies   well  as  the ank of l J a a c as B England's  rade-weighted llar.  n  the iddle  panel ollar  ovements are hown t do I m d m s against  he en  and  the ark. The  changes  are  comparably  scaled  n he iddle t y m i t m panel.  That  is,  iven ercentage  hanges  for ollar/mark d  dollar/yen e he ame g p c d an ar t s on  the  chart nd  permit    comparison f ow  the ollar s  moved against  he en a a o h d ha t y vis-a-vis  s ovements against  he  mark.  The  bottom  panel,  gain omparably it m t a c scaled,  hows the ovements of  the en  against  he ark since he eginning f  July s m y t m t b o 1997.

Given  the ollar's  vements indicated   the op  panel,  y point,  r. d mo in t m M Chairman,  is hat e are uite  ortunate   my view  that  he  world  is  not alking t w q f in t t about  too  strong    dollar t  rather  ocusing  ts  ttention   too  weak a  yen.  There a bu isf i a on are  some reasons or ur  good  fortune.  ot  the  least  s he  fact  hat  olicy nertia f o N i t t p i is most  evident  n  Japan  and  that  he en  is eak against  oth he ollar  nd  the ark, i t y w b t d a m as  you  can  see  in  he ottom anels. he  fact hat  he en  is eak against  oth t b p T t t y w b currencies  as  translated  to    remarkably table  ollar-European rrencies h in a s d cu relationship  er  the ast  ear nd  a  half  s  evidenced y  the  green  line  n  the iddle ov l y a a b i m panel  for ollar/mark.  s I  noted   moment ago,  investments  oth  in  the ast  ew d A a b l f days  and  over  the ast  ew  months  have  been  pouring ut  of merging  markets nto l f o e i core  markets. his  flight   quality  hat  has  made our  30-year  ields  o  low and T to isw y s has  reduced erman  10-year ields  o  below G y t 4-1/2 percent.  ecause  Europeans B historically  e  been  the oudest  o omplain  about oo  strong  r  too  weak a  dollar, hav l t c t o I think he  relative ability    dollar/mark  bscuring  he  public's  preciation  he t st of iso t ap oft dollar's  rength  gainst    lot  f  other  urrencies.  or  example, e passed hrough st a a o c F w t new highs  against  he exican peso  and  the anadian  dollar. t M C

Another  way to  think bout  the trength   the ollar  s o ook  at  how stable  he a s of d i t l t dollar/mark  elationship  s  been  and  to ealize at  e are n  the iddle  of  the r ha r th w i m period n  which,  as  I  would  have  expected nd  we hear necdotally,  ere  re i a a th a significant  ows nto urope  in  anticipation   he reation  f he  euro.  Those  flows fl i E oft c o t are  not oing  to ccur n  January fter  he uro  is   fact,  ut eople re rying  o g o i a t e a b p a t t position  hemselves  n  anticipation    its  reation.  gain,  with und  yields  t  41/2 t i of c A b a percent,  e see  that  he und  seems  to  be  the appy  place o  invest  n  anticipation w t b h t i of a  successful unch  of he uro  and  also o  hedge  against  ts  ailure. la t e t i f

Turning  to he ourth  age  of harts,  ou  can  see  in  the op anel he eptember t f p c y t p t S Eurodollar  utures  ontract  s  it  as  traded  rom  May  to he resent  nd  the f c a h f t p a November fed  funds  futures  ontract.  want  to  make two points  ere. irst,  u can c I h F yo see  the light  ecline  n ields  n he ast  ew days  as  expectations   an ease n s d i y i t l f of i policy,  ot mmediately ut  in  the  future, ve  come into  he arket.  What I  think s n i b ha t m i much more noticeable   the  top anel s  how flat  nd  boring hese ovements have in p i a t m become since our  July eeting  compared  with  what  they ere  earlier   he  spring. y m w int There  is uch less   sense f  "push  me/pull ou"  in  the nterest  te  arkets nd m a o y i ra m a expectations ve  gone  very  flat  ithout   lot  f ate ovement. ha w a o r m

The bottom  two  panels how something hat    depicted  everal  eetings go, s t I s m a which  is he  positive rry f n-the-run  reasury ssues.  he on-the-run  reasury t ca o o T i T T yields  re  shown in  the ed ots nd  the lue ots epresent e  term-to-date a r d a b d r h financing  or ach  of  the n-the-run sues.  he  gap  between  the wo gives ome f e o is T t s sense f  the ositive rry hat  he ealer  ommunity and  leverage  articipants  e o p ca t t d c p ar still  periencing  n  pricing  n-the-run  reasury ssues.    want  to ake clear  hat  he ex i o T i I m t t general  ollateral  te  hat  pplies  o  most  Treasury ecurities   till  ose o  the c ra t a t s iss cl t funds  rate,  nd  therefore ere  s ot s  much  positive rry or ost  off-the-run a th i n a ca f m

issues.  owever,  the rice iscovery  rocess  s ictated  y  the  on-the-run  ssues H p d p i d b i where  there  s epth, iquidity,   trading  olume. Even as  the ield  urve as i d l and v y c h been squeezed  to  below  the  funds ate, u  still  n  see  the ery odest  positive r yo ca v m carry n  the n  the-run  ssues. i o i

Turning  to  open  market  operations   the ext age, ctivity    the ederal  unds on n p a in f f market  has  been  mostly neventful  ince our  last  eeting. unds  traded t ery u s y m F a v elevated  ates  n  one  day  when wire  transfer  oblems  bottled   a  very  large r o pr up amount  of  funds  at   major oney center  ank.  That  bank  sold unds  in  the  market a m b f after  he ire  was extended.  iven the ery  firm ates  e saw around  the urn rom t w G v r w t f June  to  July,  e tried  o nticipate  milar  ressures  he atest nth-end  turn rom w t a si p att l mo f July o  August, nd  we laid  n ome repos n  advance.  We  seem to ave  succeeded t a i s i h more or  less  n alming  the arket  in  this  ase. esterday,  e had  quite  n  elevated i c m c Y w a funds  rate,  hich  is ot  depicted  n his  hart.  ugust  14,  the ast  ate hown in  the w n i t c A l d s chart,  as on  Friday,  nd  the  somewhat  higher  ange f rading  n  that  ay  occurred w a r o t o d in  anticipation   arket  pressures  ssociated th he  settlement  he reasury's ofm a wi t oft T refunding  esterday.  here  was in  fact    great  eal  of ressure  n he arket y T a d p i t m yesterday,  ut hat  eems  to e  behind s.  We  made an  outright rchase f 1 b t s b u pu o $ billion   securities    August  3,  and  we will e  looking  or pportunities    make of on b f o to additional rmanent  injections  eserves  n  the  coming  days. pe ofr i

One final  oint,  r.  Chairman:  On the ast  age  of y handout  is   list p M l p m a of primary  dealers.   number of ommittee  members and  others  n  the  System  have A C i asked  me how many dealers  here  re.  You need  a  scorecard  o  know the layers  t t a t p a present.  n  the op  half  f he age, ou can  see he 6  dealers  hose status  as  not I t o t p y t 2 w h changed  in he  last  ear. n the eft  ide f he ottom  half  f  the age, ou can  see t y O l s o t b o p y the  list  ealers  7  through 9 as  of ugust  1997. At  the ottom,  ou can  see  the ofd 2 3 A b y three  ithdrawals  hat  ave  occurred  ince hen: amaichi, astbridge, d  Sanwa. w t h s t Y E an Sanwa was the  most  recent  irm o  withdraw  from  dealer  tatus. ey were  aware f t s Th that  e thought f  them  as  one  of ur eaker  counterparties,   heir cision  o w o o w butt de t close heir  perations  as unlike  hat  f amaichi  and  Eastbridge:  t as not orced t o w t o Y I w f on  them  by  the arket  or  other  vents ut  reflected usiness  udgment n  their  art. m e b a  b j o p A dealer  peration  as not n  the ix of ctivities t  hey hought ould  be o w i m a tha t t w profitable  r hem in  New  York. fo t

In  the iddle olumn  for ugust  1998,  we have  listed e  mergers  that  ave m c A th h been  effected  o  date. n the ight  ide,  ou  can  see  that  e expect   couple ore t O r s y w a m mergers  to  take lace nd  have  two  pending pplications  r ealer  tatus.    want  to p a a fo d s I make clear  hat  e do  not  have  the  "aspiring aler"  ategory, t t till  kes ome t w de c bu i s ta s time  to  work things  ut  with   firm hat  as  approached s  to  become a  dealer. o a t h u

Mr.  Chairman,  we did ot  conduct ny  foreign  xchange  intervention  erations n a e op during he  intermeeting riod.   will eed  the  Committee's  atification he t pe I n r of  t Desk's omestic pen market  operations, d  I  will e  happy  to  answer  any d o an b questions.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The black arket  ruble s  selling   9  and  the ix as around m i at f w 7. What are  the echanics  that  llow  that  o  happen, nd  secondly,  hich of he  two  rates  ilters  to

MR. FISHER.  The right  nswer  is hat    do  not now. a t I k

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That  is he rong answer!  [Laughter] t w

MR. FISHER.  It s he  only orrect  nswer  that    am able o  give.   think he ost i t c a I t I t m important  oint  s  to e  very  skeptical out he nterbank  ixing  t .8  or  7 rubles  o  the ollar.  t s p i b ab t i f a 6 t d I i best  o  assume  that  hat  s   number that  omeone in  the entral nk  or  a  couple f anks  have t t i a s c ba o b decided  to ost n  the creen.   don't  now whether here  s  any  volume  behind  it  t ll. p o s I k t i a a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Is  there    measure  of olume in  the lack arket? a v b m MR.  FISHER.  By definition, don't  now how to  measure  that.  e  don't  ven  know we k W e whether  the lack arket  is xperiencing    deep  day or  a  thin  ay. b m e a d

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Some black arkets  are  blacker  han  others. m t MR.  FISHER.  Yes. I'm  afraid   annot elp ou  there,  r.  Chairman. Ic h y M

MR.  TRUMAN. I  don't  now either, t y guess  would  be  that  he  fixing  ate  s k bu m t r i a rate  t hich  people ave  agreed x  ante  to  settle rtain ntracts. timately,   hould rovide a w h e ce co Ul it s p some guidance,  ut  it  oesn't  ecessarily  ovide ny  in he  short  un.  The  black arket  rate b d n pr a t r m presumably  depends  a  bit  n  where  you  are nd  who you  are  and  which  black arket  you  are o a m talking  bout--the reign  xchange  kiosks utside  he ailway tation   the  large  ransactions. a fo e o t r s or t I think here  s  a  big ifference tween  those. ver  time,  e could ee  a  black arket  in  Russia t i d be O w s m that  as very  important  n  terms f  its  ffects   import ricing  nd  the nflation  ructure    one w i o e on p a i st or that as of nly  minor  significance  cause t  ould  be  the lace here  one  might  go  to  take w o be i w p w

Prell  nd  Truman. a

MR.  TRUMAN. Let  me start  ith  a  few words  about he  June  trade ata w t d that  ere  released  his  orning.  The deficit s $14.2  billion mpared  with  a w t m wa co downward revised  15.5  billion   May.  As readers  f  the ootnotes  n he $ in o f i t Greenbook  know,  we put  down an  estimate  or he une  deficit at  as f t J th w somewhat larger  han  the  one  that  as implicit   BEA's  preliminary timate  f t w in es o second-quarter  P.  We  had  weaker  exports  f oods  and  services,  ronger GD o g st imports,  nd  a  deficit  16 billion. at  deficit s similar   one  of he a of$ Th wa to t consensus arket  reports  nd  a  bit  igher  han nother, ough  both  were above m a h t a th the  BEA  estimate.  n  fact, ports  eclined  urther   June  by about he I ex d f in t magnitude  that  EA  assumed  but  by  less  han  we had  estimated.  he decline  n B t T i imports as more than  BEA  assumed  and  substantially e than  we estimated, w mor suggesting  erhaps  bit  ess trength  n  underlying  omestic emand than  we p a l s i d d might  have  thought. espite his  ositive rprise, e ffects   the  Asian  crisis D t p su th e of on our  trade alance re ot  over.  Our  bilateral  ade  eficits  th  the sian b a n tr d wi A economies, ncluding  apan, idened  further   the  second  quarter. reover, i J w in Mo we had  a  decline  n eal xports  f  goods  and  services  or   rare  econd  quarter i r e o f a s in  a  row. The  differences tween  the taff d  BEA  estimates  or eal  et be s an f r n exports  n  Q2 from  the ow-published  ata erely  reduce he eterioration m i n d m t d fro almost  $60  billion--measured hained  1992 dollars--to  ightly  ss  han  $50 in  c sl le t billion   an  annual ate. ur quick ook  at  these ata uggests  hat, ken lone, at r O l d s t ta a they  would imply  an  upward  revision  f  about  half    percentage  oint  o o a p t second-quarter owth.  However,  there  s ikely  o  be  a  substantial  fset gr i l t of in producers'  urable quipment. d e

To state  he bvious,  he une  trade ata o  not  alter e  contour  f ur t o t J d d th o o outlook or he  external  ector  rom  the  one  we have  presented  or  he ast  even f t s f f t l s meetings:  continuing  estraint aggregate  emand in  the nited  States r on d U associated th  very  weak growth  on average broad  and  a  strong ollar.  ut  we wi a d B see  some diminution  n hese  rends.  hough it  s ifficult magine  at imes, i t t T i d toi t growth  abroad ill ventually  eturn  o  trend.  n  our utlook,  rowth  picks p w e r t I o g u next  year,  ut  it  emains xtraordinarily  k.

As I  am sure ou  can  appreciate  nd  as  was amply  demonstrated  n  Peter y a i Fisher's port  nd  by  the iscussion at  ollowed t,  once  again  had  to re a d th f i we assemble  a  forecast ainst  he ackground  of  substantial  rbulence  n  global ag t b tu i financial rkets hat as  been  associated th  considerable certainty out ma t h wi un ab

MR.  PRELL.

MR.  PARRY. Mr.  Chairman,  I  have  two  questions.  ed, hen I  went  to  Asia n  June T w i one  of he  comments that    heard,  articularly orea, as that    lot f xporters  ere  facing t I p in  K w a o e w tremendous  difficulties  etting  inancing  o  support heir  usinesses. re recently,  ere ave in  g f t t b Mo th h been  discussions out  a  shortage  f  shipping  ontainers d  the eed  actually   build  hem  in ab o c an n to t Asia.  The  reason   guess s hat  ost  of he ontainers e  in he nited tates  t his  oint.  Do I i t m t c ar t U S a t p

you  think  hese evelopments re  major  factors fecting ian  exports  o  the nited  States? f t d a af As t U I these wo  problems  were  to e  dealt  ith, ould  that ead o  a  significant rease  n ur  imports t b w w l t inc i o from  Asia?

MR. TRUMAN. I  would say  a  couple f hings.    think our  sign s robably  ight. o t I y i p r I believe  he roblems  are  still ere;  e still  ar  these  eports.  he  question  s ne  of agnitude. t p th w he r T i o m It s air  o  say  that  ur mports ave  not  increased  s  much as  one  might  have  thought  s  a  result i f t o i h a a of  this  risis. t  we have  to  be  a  little  reful  bout hat  onclusion  ecause hose mports ave c Bu ca a t c b t i h held  up  in ominal  terms nd  their ices  learly  re own.  So,  in eal erms here as een  an n a pr c a d r t t h b increase  n  imports  rom  Asia, hough  perhaps ot s  much as  certain  ncentives uld  suggest i f t n a i wo there ould  have  been.  Therefore,  t  ould  seem to e that  n  time,  ne  way or  another,   he c i w m i o ift incentive   there  nd  remains,  eople ill ind    way around  the bstacles d  there  ill e is a p w f a o an w b some upward impact  on our  imports. n the  other  and, o  the xtent  hat  he  growth  of he .S. O h t e t t t U market  slows,  ot  all f he  higher  sian  exports  ay be  coming  to  the nited tates.    find t s n o t A m U S I i i quite  nteresting  at  he ne  area here  we seem to  have  been  about ight  n  our  forecasts   he i th t o w r i ist extent  o  which  the wing  in he rade osition  f  the eveloping  sian  countries s  been  shared t s t t p o d A ha among importing ountries.  ome considerable action s  gone  to  Japan, otwithstanding  s c S fr ha n it own situation,  d  a  considerable action   Europe  as  well. ndeed,  n  line  ith ome an fr to I i w s comments at  recent  eetings,  uropean  domestic emand has  been  much stronger  han e m E d t w expected  efore he risis,  d  European  net xports  ave  been  much weaker.

MR.  PARRY. Thank you.

more significant  r any firms n  different dustries.    the ast,  t east  hen we had  an fo m i in In p a l w economic  slowdown,  sticky  ages were an  important  utomatic tabilizer. e you  done  any w a s Hav analysis  hat  an  give s  some insight to  ow the  more flexible mpensation ractices ll n t c u in h co p wi i fact  ffect  otal  ompensation hen the .S.  economy goes  into    slowdown and  what  the ffects a t c w U a e on spending ight  be?

MR. PRELL.  We  are  engaged  in  a  multifaceted  search  ffort  n  that  ssue.  n  a  sense, re e o i I the  work that  he eserve  Banks  were  kind nough  to  do  for s  in onducting  he  survey s   small t R e u c t i a component  of hat  esearch.  e  have  been  talking  o irms,  nterviewing em  in  some depth,  nd t r W t f i th a we are  going  to e  doing  more  of hat.  ur  contacts  mphasize hat  his  s   new labor b t O e t t i a compensation egime  and  that  lexible mpensation ractices ll nable hem  to  cut ack  on r f co p wi e t b labor  osts f  he conomy and  their  ortunes  eteriorate.  at  outcome  is ntested  nd  time  will c i t e f d Th u a tell.  e  also re  doing  some statistical  k at   micro  level, ing mployment cost ndex  data W a wor a us e i from  the ureau  of abor  Statistics,  ry  o  estimate  t he irm evel  ow businesses  re B L to  t t a t f l h a managing in  this  ew regime, erhaps y trading  ff arious  omponents  of heir  ompensation n p b o v c t c packages  and  so  on.

I  would  stress at ur  projection  he  ECI does  not ssume  a  major  change  in th o oft a compensation ehavior.  Some of  these ompensation  elements o  not  even  show up in  the CI. b c d E That  is nother actor  e need  to  take nto ccount n hinking  bout  cost ressures   the  economy a f w i a i t a p in and  how those ay wax or  wane.  Basically,  e ost  important  lement oing  forward s he m th m e g i t

MR.  STOCKTON. One factor  n  thinking  bout  the pending utlook  s hat  t s i a s o i t i i conceivable  hat  s  variable  ay  becomes more  important, ofits ll ecome less ariable  nd t a p pr wi b v a labor  ncome more variable.  hat  is,  hen there  s  a  slowdown in he  expansion,  ore  of  it ill i T w i t m w show up  in  the orm  of   slowdown in  labor ncome  than n  capital  ncome.  Past stimates f a i i i e typically  ve  indicated gher  arginal ropensities    consume out  of  labor  ncome than ut  of ha hi m p to i o capital  ncome  than  had  previously en  the ase.  If hose ropensities  re  to  remain  the ame, i be c t p we s the  implication uld  be  that  onsumer  spending ould  be  more cyclically  nsitive. guing  from wo c c se Ar first inciples,  wever, ne  might  think hat  hose arginal ropensities   onsume would pr ho o t t m p toc change  if  n  fact  eople egan  to ecognize  hat  heir  abor  ncome  was  indeed ore variable w i p b r t t l i m no than n  the ast. n  essence,  he  marginal ropensity   consume out  of  labor  ncome  should hrink i p I t p to i s somewhat as  consumers  perceive  hat  ny  movements in  their  abor  ncome  may now be  more t a l i transitory  an as the ase  earlier. ose  are ust  ome conjectures out ow changing th w c Th j s ab h compensation  practices uld ffect  pending. onsumer income  might  become more variable  nd co a s C a spending ore sensitive    income  changes  if  eople ontinued  o onsume out  of ermanent m to p c t c p income  as  they ave  in  the ast. hat  effect  ight  be  muted  to  the xtent  hat  heir havior h p T m e t t be actually  hanges  when they ecognize  hat  he  sensitivity heir  abor  ncomes  to  changing c r t t of  t l i economic  conditions  as  increased. h

MR.  PARRY. There  certainly  e  a lot f tudies  hat uggest hat  he  marginal ar o s t s t t propensity  o  consume would  be  lower f ariable  ncomes  were  expected o  regress  o  Friedman's t i v i t t original  ermanent  income levels. p

MR.  STOCKTON. Right.

MR.  PRELL.  That  might  be  true  t  least  or hose eople ho are ot iving  ssentially a f t p w n l e from  hand  to  mouth. I  think    lot  f hese lexible y  schemes  tend o  affect  eople ho  are n he a o t f pa t p w i t upper  income  brackets  nd  have  no  liquidity  nstraints. a co

MR.  JORDAN.

We  have  a  retailer    our  board  who reports  hat  e th c o g on t h is mporting    lot  ore from  Asia, nd  his mport ill  as  gone  down. That  says  the olume  effects i a m a i b h v did  not wamp  the rice  ffects.  ow  should e think  bout  these  mport umbers, iven  this s p e H w a i n g exchange  rate  nd  pricing  roblem? a p

MR.  TRUMAN. The answer  to  the irst rt f our  question  s hat  e have  aggregate f pa o y i t w price nd  aggregate  uantity  umbers. The aggregate  rice  umbers  basically me from  the LS a q n p n co B survey  of mport rices.  here  are  problems ith  those mport rices, d  what  we do  is o  take i p T w i p an t a nominal  total  nd  deflate   an  index  at arious  evels  f etail   get eal igures.  he  quality a by v l o d to r f T of the  price  ata s ubstantially ter  han  it  as 20 years go.  We  used  to  have  something alled d i s bet t w a c "the nit alue,"  hich  really  ould  have  led  you  to  ask  this  uestion.  n  the ther  and, t lso s u v w w q O o h i a i not  clear  hat  we are  now getting  ith  the rice  ata r hat  question  hey re  answering. hat's w w p d o w t a T because  it  s nclear  hat  the elationship etween  the  price hat  s uoted  on  an invoice  nd i u w r isb t i q a

included n  the ndex  and  the rice  t hich the  sale ctually  ade and  embodied  in  aggregate i i p a w a ism demand.

The other oint s xactly  hat  I  was trying  o  say  in  response o ob Parry's estion. p i e w t t B qu We  do  have  disaggregated ice ndices  y  area,  nd  we can  see  what  has  happened  to  the rice pr i b a p index  for he sian  countries.  hat  has  declined  ramatically. u may then  say  that  he ominal t A T d Yo t n amounts  of  our  imports  rom  them  have  been  flat,    the ncrease  n eal mports as  been f so i i r i h substantial.  hink  he nly  point hat  e can  make here s hat  e have  a  J-curve  ffect. e I  t t o t w i t w e W might  have  expected hat  -curve ffect   have  run  its  ourse arlier. ave  not een  able o ook t J e to c e I  h b t l at he  detail  f he umbers  that  ame out  today,  ut  there  ave  been  stories,  r xample, elating t o t n c b h fo e r to  some industrial  pplies.  ou probably ave  heard dditional ories out  iron nd  steel, r su Y h a st ab a fo example,  some involving  orea.  The  trouble  s hat  e have  a  third  actor, ich  is he  general K i t w f wh t weakness  of  commodity prices.  n  fact, e  of he urprises    the ata hat  ame in  today  was I on t s in d t c that  une  exports  nd  imports f  industrial  pplies  ere  much less  han e had  anticipated. J a o su w t w I asked  the ame question  ou are  asking,  s his  hortfall  minal  or  is t  eal? he answer ay be s y i t s no i r T m some of  both.  A lot f  it  ay well e  nominal, n hich  case eal ould  be  less.  he analysis  s o m b i w r w T i very  complicated.  he other hing  ou want  to emember is hat  lthough onceptually  think T t y r t a c we about  exports  nd  imports  s  being inal  emand,  they re ot. ery few  imports o  directly  om a a f d a n V g fr the  ship r  the lane o  the upermarket  helf.  s a  result,  e ay they  get mbedded  in  the o p t s s A th w i production  nd  therefore e  price tructure    very  complicated, d  it  robably as  become more a th s is an p h complicated  n  recent  ears. ust-in-time  ventories,  duced ransportation ts,  nd  the i y J in re t cos a reduced  weight  in  GDP  which  the hairman  likes  o ite  ean that  he ay these  hings  et C t c m t w t g integrated counts  or uch less f  GDP.  That  is robably ne  of he easons hy simple ules ac f m o p o t r w r of  thumb for xchange  rate  epreciation    exchange  rate  hanges  and  inflation  ve  tended o e d or c ha t

MR.  JORDAN. Thank you. I  also ave  a  question  bout  the reenbook's utlook or h a G o f the  U.S.  economy and  the mphasis n wealth ffects.  ollowing p  on  your  response  o  Bob e o e F u t Parry,  t eems  on  the  surface  hat  here  ight  be  some logic  nd  even  some indirect pirical i s t t m a em evidence n  support  f  these ealth ffects. ople  are  behaving n ecent  onths  and  quarters  s i o w e Pe i r m a though  their  ermanent  income  is ither  bove  or  has  risen  elative    their  easured  income. The p e a r to m indirect idence f  that  hows up  in  measures  such  as  the ersonal  aving ate  nd  so  on. I  do ev o s p s r a not  know how much weight  to  give o  all  f  that.  ut  suppose he  central nk  does  give t o B t ba significant  ight  to  that  ind  of henomenon, how do  we then void ncorporating  ews  about we k p a i vi equity  arkets  in  the ormulation  f onetary  policy? e  would  run  into he roblem  we have m f o m W t p discussed  efore bout  somehow  using he evel f  the tock arket  or  changes  in he tock b a t l o s m t s market  perhaps ot s  an  indicator t  almost s  an  objective  olicy. n a bu a ofp

MR. PRELL.  If ou  felt  hat  he arket  was likely  o tart  ally  gain,  ven  against y t t m t s or a e the  fundamentals,  nd  to  spur ggregate  emand in  a  way that  ou  felt  xcessive  n erms f  the a a d y e i t o inflation  ospects  hat  ould go  with  that,  think  hat ould  argue t  the  margin  for onsidering pr t w I t w a c a  tightening  olicy  hat  ou would  not  otherwise  ave  wanted  to  institute e  it  ot or hat ofp t y h wer n f t expectation.  ow, what  I  think    heard rom  many people round  the able  s hat  hey  want  to N I f a t i t t remain  humble  about  their  bility   anticipate  vements in  the tock arket,  specially a to mo s m e nonfundamental ovements. So,  that  ight  cause  you to  be  reluctant    move with  great orce n m m to f o a  hunch  about hich  way the arket  would  go.  But  I hink  ou  have  to ave  one.  It s anifest w m t y h i m in  the ehavior  f he  economy in  the ast  ouple  of ears hat  he  stock arket's  ovements are b o t l c y t t m m of  considerable portance. ou need  to  take   position   this. im Y a on

Mr.  Chairman,  I  might ust  dd  one  small act.   an't y  for ure hat  e have  this j a f Ic sa s t w nailed  own,  but   am told hat  ur  first ok t he rade ata uggests  hat bout d I t o lo a t t d s t a 3/4 of  the  imports of  capital  oods  would  be  offsets  DE.

This  slowing s onsistent  th  what  might  be  expected rom  the estraining  fects i c wi f r ef of the  East sian  financial  d  economic  problems. ata  for he  first ve  onths  of  1998 compared A an D t fi m with  the ame period n  1997 show that  rowth  in  total  istrict  ports  as  fallen  ssentially s i g D ex h e to zero  following  ubstantial  owth  in revious ears. his  slowdown appears o e  almost ntirely s gr p y T t b e attributable ast  Asia.  For  example, n  the irst  arter  f  this  ear,  alifornia's orts  o  key to  E i f qu o y C exp t East  Asian  countries re  down about  13 percent  ompared  to  a  year arlier. ports ave we c e Ex h slowed  substantially oughout  he istrict,  d  Hawaii's  truggling onomy has  been  hit ard thr t D an s ec h by  additional sses  n  their  sian  tourist siness  his  ear.

Turning  to  the ation,  t  emains o e seen  whether he ong  awaited lowdown will  e n i r t b t l s b sustained  uring he  second  half  ecause  a  good  deal  of he lowdown was due  to  temporary d t b t s factors.  espite hese oubts,    think hat  he ost  likely tcome is oderate  growth  of round  2 D t d I t t m ou m a percent  hrough he  end  of ext ear,  ith  activity ing  restrained    problems n  East sian t t n y w be by i A economies, he  high  dollar, strictive cal  olicy, d  relatively  gh eal hort-term terest t re fis p an hi r s in rates.  he recent  rop  in  our  stock arket dds  another  otentially  derating actor.

The news on  inflation  rtainly ntinues  o  be  outstanding. e GDP  price  ndex ce co t Th i came in  under  percent  or he  second  straight  arter  nd,  as  we all  now, inflation    measured 1 f t qu a k as by  that  ndex as  averaged nly  1  percent  ver  the ast ear. n  our  Bank forecast,  e i h o o p y I th unemployment rate oes  not  quite each  percent  y  the nd  of  1999.

As far s  the ational  conomy is  concerned,    have  talked  efore bout  what  I  perceive a n e I b a as  the ension  etween  the  pace  at hich  domestic ggregate  emand is  growing  versus he t b w a d t growth  in  aggregate  upply nd  how the wo  might  ultimately   reconciled.  t  the oment,  it s a t be A m looks  as  if  he econciliation ccurring  hrough he  serious  nd  sustained  eakness  in  Asia  and t r is  o t t a w the  squeeze  on  domestic rofit rgins, ith  their  ttendant fects   equity  rices  nd p ma w a ef on p a ultimately eir  ealth ffects  n  the  economy.

Even though  we and  everyone  else  re  happy  about he  low  inflation,  ow a t thel unemployment,  and  the  good  income  gains hat  e are  seeing n  the ation,  ould  be  very  hard t w i n itw to  call  his    well alanced xpansion t he resent  ime.  We  can  put  a  favorable  pin n  the ast t a b e a t p t s o p year  by  saying hat  n  view  of he ery  strong  omestic emand,  we are ortunate at  he sian t i t v d d f th t A economies  fell  part  t ust  he ight  ime, hat  heir  xports  ere available   meet  our  surging a a j t r t t t e w to consumption,  nd  that  heir  educed emand for ur  exports  iberated  me domestic ndustrial a t r d o l so i capacity  o  that  he omestic conomy did ot  spill  ver  into ising flation.   we could urn s t d e n o r in Or t things  ompletely  round  the ther  ay and  say  that  n  view  of he sian  crisis,    s eally    good c a o w i t A it i r a

MR. POOLE. Conditions  n  the ighth istrict  e  substantially    same  as  they ave i E D ar the h been  in  recent  onths.  Labor  markets emain ight.  abor  shortages  re  abundant,  articularly m r t L a p in professional  eas. uilders  re  unable o  satisfy mand in  some markets.

I  want  to oncentrate  comments on  the ational  conomy. I  also ant  to  talk  bout c my n e w a Asia  from  that  erspective,  t   will egin y  talking  bout he alance etween  aggregate  upply p bu I b b a t b b s and  demand,  putting  sia  aside. n the ggregate  upply ide,    think  hat  e probably ave A O a s s I t w h overshot  ull  mployment and  are  seeing vidence f hat  n  the pcreep  of  wages  and  in  the abor f e e o t i u l shortages  hat  re idely  reported.  y  casual mpression  s hat  e have  rising  umbers of abor t a w M i i t w n l disputes  nd  time  lost  hrough abor isputes.  here  have  been  a  number of trikes. at  is a t l d T s Th a standard  eature  f  labor  arkets hat  re  overstressed.  most  independently  hat  happens  to f o m t a Al ofw aggregate  emand,  I  think  e can  anticipate  ower rowth  of mployment than e have  had  as d w sl g e w we move toward  a  closer  quilibrium  f upply nd  demand in  the abor  arket. e o s a l m

On the  aggregate  emand side,  omestic inal  ales  emain  strong,  nd  that  as true n d d f s r a w i the  second uarter  s  well.  Money  growth, hether  we use 2  or   narrower easure--I  refer q a w M a m p MZM because  I  think  t  voids he roblem  with  sweeps--is  p substantially r  the ast  ear n i a t p u ove l y i terms  of oth  measures.  It as  tapered  own a  little t  recently,  t   see  no  signs f   real urn. b h d mos bu I o a t

Now, how big  is he  impact rom  Asia? Has that lowed  aggregate  emand sufficiently t f s d to  put s  on a  reasonable  rack  or he ear uture? sia  accounts or oughly 5 percent  f he u t f t n f A f r 2 o t world  economy. If  5 percent  f he  world's  conomy gets nto eep  trouble, e  would  expect o 2 o t e i d on t see  a  big mpact n the ther  5  percent.  he question  ere s he  magnitudes nvolved. onsider i o o 7 T h i t i C an  analogy ithin he  United  States.  uppose  California t  into eally  ig rouble. uppose  Bob w t S go r b t S Parry eally  crewed  up  so  that  he hole Twelfth istrict  d  a  financial isis d  California r s t w D ha cr an looked  about ike apan  and  Nevada about  like  ndonesia  nd  Oregon about ike  alaysia nd  so l J I a l M a

The labor  arkets re  closely  nterconnected i ca ma m a i through   lot f ovement  of  the  workforce. he goods  markets re  completely  onnected.  here a o m T a c T are  no trade  arriers cept or   few agricultural riers. ying o  take ruit to alifornia y b ex f a bar Tr t f in C ma be  a  problem, ut hat's  out t. b t ab i

The  relationship   he  Asian  economies  to  the conomies  of he est  f he orld  is oft e t r o t w quite ifferent.  e labor arkets re  not  integrated   all. he goods  markets  are ntegrated. d Th m a at T i The Asian  economies  are pen,  but othing ike alifornia d  the est  f he nited  States. o n l C an r o t U Capital  arkets  are airly ll  integrated.  ere  are  floating change  rates, t ot   single m f we Th ex bu n a currency.  o,  there  s   very reat  ifference  tween  25 percent  f  the  world  economy in  Asia S i a g d be o and  a  comparable iece f  the .S.  economy. p o U

The question  s  how large  re  the  impacts lowing rom  Asia  to  the est  f he orld i a f f r o t w economy and  particularly he  United  States.  otal  .S.  exports  re  something n  the rder f to  t T U a o o o 14  percent  f DP, and  our  exports  o  Asia  are  something n  the rder f  percent  f DP. o G t o o o 3 o G These  are  rough  orders  f agnitude,  lose nough  for ack-of-the-envelope  lculations. o m c e b ca Of course,  e are ot  going  to ose ll f ur  exports  o  Asia.

But  it  s ritical    get he agnitudes ight E U i c to t m r and  not e  seduced y  the igh  visibility he  Asian  problems. here  is o question  hat  hese b b h of  t T n t t Asian  countries  re xperiencing  ery  severe roblems,  ut he uestion  s ow big  are he a e v p b t q i h t impacts  flowing hrough nto he  United tates  conomy as  a  whole. t i t S e

The research  taff  t he  St. ouis  Fed  has  taken   look t he isaggregated S. s a t L a a t d U. exports or he irst ve onths  of  this  ear elative    the  first ve onths of  last  ear.

In  other  ords,  firms n  those ndustries  ve  seen  their  rders  f uch e t w i i ha o o s products  rom  Asia  cut n  half.  bviously,  hat  s ery  visible. oducers f ome other roducts f i O t i v Pr o s p like  efined  etroleum nd  related ods  have  seen  their  sian  demand decline  y  as  much as  47 r p a go A b percent.  f e go  down the  list,  riculture  d  livestock ports  o  Asia  are  down  29  percent  his I w ag an ex t t year ompared  to  last  ear.

Of  course,  he elevant estion  or he mpact  on the  U.S.  economy is ot  those t r qu f t i n numbers  but  the ecline  n  exports  o  Asia  relative    the ize f hese ndustries.    e take he d i t to s o t i Ifw t industry  hat  as  experienced  he iggest  ercentage  mpact,  etallic  res nd  concentrates,  ich t h t b p i m o a wh lost  0  percent  f ts  sian  business, at  urns  ut  to  be  about 5 o i A th t o 1-1/4 percent  f  the roduct f hat o p o t industry,  ing  1996 production  evels.  o,  the oss f  the sian  business  mounted  to  1-1/4 percent us l S l o A a of  the omestic roduction  f hat ndustry.  hat  gives s  the ight  rder f agnitude  in erms  of d p o t i T u r o o m t the  effects thin he nited  States.  he biggest  mpact or ny  of hese ndustries   hat  or wi t U T i f a t i ist f agriculture  d  livestock,  ich  lost  bout   percent  f ts  usiness  s  a  consequence f he an wh a 2 o i b a o t reduction  n  exports  o  Asia.  on't  now what  the ffects  he  Asian  problems ill e  in ther i t Id k e oft w b o parts  f  the orld,  ut   think  t  s ery  important  or s  to  keep  the agnitudes n  the ontext  f o w b I i i v f u m i c o the  size f  the arket  in he nited  States.  n  addition,  should ot  forget  he ndirect fsets o m t U I we n t i of that  ake lace ecause  Asia  is ot  an integrated  rt f  single  urrency  rea ithin he nited t p b n pa o a c a w t U States,  he oint hat    made before. t p t I

MR.  GRAMLICH. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  The expansion learly  s  weakening. c i Real  GDP  according  o  the  Greenbook  is lready  elow  the  trend rowth  rate  n  this  alf  ear,  nd t a b g i h y a it alls en  shorter  n  the ext alf  ear. nemployment  rises  n  all f he  Greenbook  scenarios. f ev i n h y U i o t Depending  on  the  stock arket, he ate f  unemployment may at east  rguably et  close  o  my m t r o l a g t definition   AIRU ofN fairly  oon.  As one  listens  he eserve ank presidents,  e  hears uch s tot R B on m more commentary than  a  few  months ago  using ords  like  slowing,"  negative  sychology," w " " p "less  ositive,"  cetera. p et

Let  me bring sia  back  on  the able.  he Asian  forecasts e eing rogressively A t T ar b p downgraded.  I  believe  he  staff ready  as  moved about ne-fourth  f  the ay to  its  o-called t al h o o w s pessimistic  recast  f he ast  eeting n  this  orecast.  he  process robably s ot  completed. fo o t l m i f T p i n Even in  the resent  orecast,    Ted  Truman commented earlier,  reign  rowth  is ery  weak. p f as fo g v

A few months  ago,   felt  hat t  as  time  to aise  he  fed unds ate   bit.    now think I t i w r t f r a I that  he ime  is oming,  perhaps ery  soon, hen the  right  hing o  do  may be  to  lower  the unds t t c v w t t f rate    bit. hether  a  lower ate  s eeded  at his  eeting  is ery  debatable, t he ay things  re a W r i n t m v bu t w a going,   believe  e could e confronting is  ssue  ather  oon.

On the  national  icture, ave  a  few comments about he  Greenbook  forecast. e p I  h t Th Greenbook sees he  slowdown in  inventory  ccumulation  nd  the  deterioration  net xports  hat t a a i e t occurred n  the  second  quarter  s  setting e tage or   sharp nd  lasting owing n  the rowth  of i a th s f a a sl i g domestic inal  emand. As a  consequence  of hat  lowdown and  a  further gnificant  terioration f d t s si de in  net xports, al DP  is xpected o  expand  at   rate  ust  elow  its  otential,  lieving me of e re G e t a j b p re so the  pressure  n  labor  arkets  and  lowering ore  inflation it  n oming quarters.  t ould  be o m c a  b i c I w very  nice f  his  hain f vents ere  actually alized  nd  I  hope  it  ill e, ut  I  have  some i t c o e w re a w b b doubts.

First, mestic  demand is xpected o  slow  promptly o  about  half  ts  verage ace  in do e t t i a p the  first  rt f  1998. Given  that  abor  arkets djusted  or he M pa o l m a f t G strike  pparently  ightened a t

further   July,  ointing  o  further al age growth,   am not onvinced hat  omestic  spending in p t re w I c t d will low  as  much and  as  promptly s  in  the reenbook forecast. s a G

Secondly,  s  Mike Prell  oted arlier,  e reenbook is orecasting uch  greater a n e th G f a  m deterioration  net xports han  the lue  Chip  forecasters.    fact,   oticed  hat  he reenbook  is in e t B In In t t G about  as  pessimistic    the verage f  the  ten ost  pessimistic  ue  Chip  forecasters.  e as a o m Bl Th Greenbook's orecast  f  net  exports  epresents  drag  on  real DP  growth  of bout  1  percent  n f o r a G a i the  second  half  f  1998.  By contrast,  e  Blue  Chip  consensus ooks or   much  smaller  rop  in o th l f a d net  exports, th  much less  rag  on  GDP.  I  know  that  oreign  rade  evelopments re ery wi d f t d a v difficult   orecast  nd  I  certainly   not  a  forecaster,  n  the ace f t,  he reenbook  seems tof a am buto f o i t G to  be  at he ow  end  on  this  oint. t l p

I  see onsiderable side isk  n  the reenbook forecast  he conomic  outlook. c up r i G oft e Inflation  self, tinued  trong  omestic  demand,  and  the econd-quarter  mp  in  the CI are it con s d s ju E particularly risome. The latter  y indicate me ebbing  in  the roductivity  owth  that  as wor ma so p gr h been  holding own unit abor osts.    also orry  that  e are  at isk  f   jump in  health  are osts d l c I w w r o a c c that ould  raise  he enefit-cost  mponent  of he CI. And,  as  Mike Prell  ointed  ut,  he w t b co t E p o t special  urvey ata n  variable y  suggests  hat  he CI  may understate mpensation osts. s d o pa t t E co c

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Rivlin.

MS. RIVLIN.  We  in  the OMC F tend  to oncentrate  what  has  happened  since e c on w last  et, his  agical eriod nown only  in  this  oom as  the ntermeeting riod,  ut  I ind t m t m p k r i pe b f i interesting   o back  a  little  rther metimes.  In  this  ase,    went  back  to arch,  which  is nly tog fu so c I M o five onths ago,  and  found  myself ery  impressed,  hich  is   compliment, olks,  ith he m v w a f w t forecasting  ility    the  staff. e March meeting,  s  you remember,  was held ear he  end  of  a ab of Th a n t roaring  irst arter  hat  roved  to e  even stronger an  we expected t hat  ime.  The staff s f qu t p b th a t t wa

predicting,  beit mewhat diffidently, astic  lowdown in  the  expansion ue  to  inventory al so a  dr s d deceleration d  the mpact  of he  Asian  financial isis   our  net xports.  here  was some an i t cr on e T skepticism  round  this  able, cluding  y own,  but n  hindsight  t  ppears hat  he taff de a a t in m i i a t t s ma quite ood forecast. e timing as a  little  f;  he  first arter  as stronger  nd  the econd g Th w of t qu w a s weaker  than hey  anticipated,   the asic orecast   slowing o  less  han otential r he est  f t but b f of t t p fo t r o this  ear nd  next ooks ncreasingly  ght  o  me. They also alled  he  stock arket  about y a l i ri t c t m right--so  r. espite  he educed arnings  xpectations  at  re ound  to  occur ith  slower fa D t r e e th a b w growth, hey  expected nly  a  modest  correction   the  stock arket.  So far,  hat  s hat  we have t o in m t i w gotten.

What is  evident  ooking ack  even  five onths  is hat  he sian  crisis  roving  o  be l b m t t A isp t deeper,  ore intractable,    possibly  ore contagious  han  we thought  t  ould  be  a  few  months m and m t i w ago.  Japan  is ore deeply ired  in  political  ralysis. her sian  economies, specially m m pa Ot A e Indonesia,  re  in ore desperate  hape.  China, ncluding  ong Kong,  Russia,  nd  possibly  razil, a m s i H a B are ore fragile an  we anticipated   hat  ime. m th att t

Looking  ahead, t  eems  to e that  he verheating  f he .S.  economy is ikely  e i s m t o o t U l tob slipping  nto he ategory  f ast orries  espite  ome evidence f  shortages  f onstruction  d i t c o p w d s o o c an other orkers  and  of  some materials at  ave  been  mentioned  around he  table.  e  have  learned w th h t W over  the ast  ouple f  years hat  ven  with  extremely  ight  abor  arkets,  ur  economy is uch l c o t e t l m o m less  rone  to  accelerating  flation  an  we thought t  as. Labor  markets  now seem  likely  ase p in th i w toe up  a  bit  s  conomic  growth  slows.  That  does  not ecessarily  an that  e will void n  uptick a e n me w a a in  inflation   elayed eaction   higher ages,  possible creases  n  health  are osts,  nd  some ind r to w in i c c a other actors  hat  ave  been  mentioned.  Indeed,  e might  be  in  for   bit  f tagflation.   hat f t h w a o s Ift happens, e may unfortunately  ve  to  live  ith  it.  t s ard o  imagine  raising terest  tes  n w ha w I i h t in ra i

the  face f oftening  mployment and  economic  growth  that s elow  potential. at has  been o s e i b Wh learned  efore s hat  e do  not ave  a  very  good  tool  o  combat  stagflation    e get  it. b i t w h t ifw

I  suspect  hat  omestic verheating  nd  inflation  e  going o  be  fairly w  on our ist t d o a ar t lo l of worries ver  the ext ew months. Rather,    suspect  hat  e will e  focused ore and  more on o n f I t w b m how to  keep  the orld  economy--the on-European,  on-North  American  economy--from w n n unraveling  urther d  how to itigate  he amage to  our  own economy.  It s ot  hard o  imagine f an m t d i n t that  orld  growth, nstead  f ecovering  odestly n  1999  as  forecast   the reenbook,  might  get w i o r m i in G a  good  deal orse  before  t  ets etter  nd  that  ecovery  ill e  delayed t east  ntil  he ear w i g b a r w b a l u t y 2000. Our economy now looks trong  nough to  weather  the torm  without    recession,  t  its s e s a bu ability    do  that  epends  heavily  n  consumer  confidence  nd  the bsence f   rout  n  the tock to d o a a o a i s market.  My  guess ow would be  that  e will et   series  f rderly  orrections   the tock n w g a o o c in s market--stair ps  own to  values ore in  line  ith  realistic fit  xpectations--but  ket ste d m w pro e mar psychology s  a  fragile ing. i th

This  all dds  up  to aying hat    believe  he isks  re ow  at  least   much on  the a s t I t r a n as downside  as  on  the  upside nd  that  ot oving  the ederal  unds ate s ertainly e ight  olicy a n m f f r i c th r p for ow. n

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Ferguson.

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. As I eview  the urrent  conomic r c e outlook    am,  like  thers,  truck  y  the trong  ut  at east  urrently lanced orces  hat  ppear o I o s b s b l c ba f t a t be  shaping he uture.  otentially  akening  developments temming  from  the xternal  ector t f P we s e s seem to  be  balanced gainst    currently rong omestic ector, though ome weakness  in  the a a st d s al s latter    a  possibility. also ontinue  o  see  a  dichotomy etween  the  goods  sector, cluding is We c t b in commodities  and  agriculture,   the  service  ector.  think  he inks  cross  hese arious and s I t l a t v

balances nd  dichotomous  elements f  the  economy reside  n  two  areas. ne is he abor  arkets a o i O t l m and  the  other  s he inancial rkets.  The challenge  o  me is hat  his  alance  s uite  ragile i t f ma t t t b i q f right  ow,  and  it eems  very  much like    high-wire  ct here a  move to ither  ide ould  be  quite n s a a w e s w detrimental.

As others  ave  indicated,  velopments elating    the  external  ector  learly  ave h de r to s c h slowed  the rowth  of DP.  The Greenbook projections  ggest  hat  he xternal  ector  ill low g G su t t e s w s the  expansion ess  nd  less oing  forward. herefore,  ne  might  think  hat  t hould e  less  nd l a g T o t i s b a less    part  f ur  deliberations. ever,  the isk  hat    see  here s hat  he  staff y have a o o How r t I i t t ma underestimated  he et rag  that  ill ome from  the xternal  ide.   agree ith  Ted  Truman that t n d w c e s I w its  egative  ontribution  entually ll urn round, ut   see  some risk  hat  he apanese n c ev wi t a b I t t J economy will ot  turn round  as  quickly  s  in he reenbook  forecast. e  current  reenbook n a a t G Th G estimates  hat  conomic  activity    Japan  declined  t   5 percent  ate  n  the irst lf  f his  ear, t e in a a r i f ha o t y and  it nticipates lat  erformance n  the econd  half  nd  an  upturn o  a  low  growth  rate  n  the a a  f p i s a t i first rt f  next ear.  That  forecast ems  a  little  timistic    me. Also, s  the vents  f  this pa o y se op to a e o week have  indicated,  obal ontagion  s till ry  much  a  risk  hat  ould ndermine  fragile gl c i s ve t c u recoveries ound  the  world. The staff recast,    Governor  Gramlich  indicated,  s  moved ar o as ha some distance  oward  the o-called orse  case" cenario.    hope  that  hat  artial vement is t s "w s I t p mo not  further etted  y  unfolding  vents  verseas. n  any  event,  he mportance f  the xternal ab b e o I t i o e sector  s  much greater an  the  or   percent  f  GDP  that  s ccounted or  y  the .S.  current i th 3 4 o i a f b U account eficit. d

The domestic  economy provides   marked counterpoint   the  external  ector.  he a o s T Greenbook  forecast lls  or ome abatement f  what  has  been  very  strong rowth.  That ca f s o g abatement s ased  to  a  very  substantial  tent  n  an  anticipated  minution  f ealth ffects. i b ex o di o w e

Such an  outcome  is uite  ossible.  he recent  o-called ar orrection   the  stock arket  lends q p T s ne c in m some credibility  this  cenario.  owever,  as  others  ave  indicated,  e  stock arket  is o s H h th m notoriously fficult    forecast.  erefore,  would  say  with espect  o urely omestic di to Th I r t p d developments  that    sense onsiderable nsion  etween  factors  ointing  o  an overly trong I c te b p t s expansion nd  those hat uggest   potential r ome shortfall    demand from  current a t s a fo s in expectations. r  me at his  oint,  hose wo  sets f actors  eem to e  roughly n  balance. Fo t p t t o f s b i

The other  et f irror mages  that  e are  dealing  ith  is he oods  sector  ersus  he s o m i w w t g v t service  ector.  t s lear  hat  he oods  sector  as  thus ar aken he runt  f  the dverse mpact f s I i c t t g h f t t b o a i o foreign  rade  evelopments. oods exports  nd  imports eem to  account or lmost ll f he  net t d G a s f a a o t export rag  that  e have  experienced.  dditionally,  e  goods  sector  as  been  an  important d w A th h player  n he  recent  erformance f  the omestic conomy in  that  he  swing  in  inventory i t p o d e t investment  as a  key  factor  n he hift  f DP  from  very  rapid rowth  in  the irst arter  o w i t s o G g f qu t much reduced  growth  in  the econd. orward-looking  ndicators,  ch  as  recent  urchasing s F i su p manager  surveys,  how some weakness  in he  goods  sector  oing  forward.  However,  I  think s t g there  re  some signs f trength  ven  in  that ector. hile  there as a  slowdown in  the uildup a o s e s W w b of  inventories    the econd uarter, ock uilding  as still  bstantial, ething ike    percent in s q st b w su som l 6 at  an  annual ate.  or  its  art, e  service  ector  s   clear  tory  f trength ilding  n strength, r F p th s i a s o s bu o and  the reenbook  forecast ows  that  s  basically ntinuing. G sh a co

The linkages  cross hese  arious lements f  our  economy may be  seen, s  I  said,  n a t v e o a i the  labor  arkets. he overall  abor  arket  is bviously  ight  nd  likely  o  stay ight.  he m T l m o t a t t T tightness ems  to  be  discouraging  ome layoffs  n  industries  at  ave  been  affected   the se s i th h by externally  duced rag.  Not  surprisingly,    strength   demand also as  forced mployers  in in d the in h e other  ectors  f he  economy,  in  the ervice  ector  n articular, ncrease  he umber of orkers s o t s s i p to  i t n w

that hey mploy. So,  it eems  to e that  he  unemployment  rate,  s  the reenbook  suggests, t e s m t a G is likely  o  adjust  ery lowly o  a  moderating conomic  expansion. hile  I  think he abor  arkets t v s t e W t l m will e  slow  to djust,  will ee  and  have  seen  that  inancial  rkets re  quite  uick o  adjust, b a we s f ma a q t and  they dd  a  degree f olatility he  economy. a o v to  t

I  think he otential  terplay at  e are  starting    see etween  corporate  rofits,  ock t p in th w to b p st valuations,  d  consumer  performance re he  elements hat  re ost  relevant  o  us.  I  believe  hey an a t t a m t t represent  he ain sources f  risk  o  the orecast. e staff recast  epends  on  this  olatility t m o t f Th o d v and an  adjustment  n quity rices  o  more conservative ofit tlooks  o  bring he  various  lements i e p t pr ou t t e of  the conomy into  n  equilibrium   a  lower,  ndeed ubtrend, owth  rate. nfortunately, e a at i s gr U I think  here re any risks  o his  immaculate lowing" orecast. e  most  obvious tem  from t a m t t " s f Th s the  weaknesses  in oreign  conomies  and  the nternational ancial  rmoil  hat  ontinue  o  take f e i fin tu t c t some toll  n  psychology nd  real conomic  performance. n the ther  and, ight  abor arkets, o a e O o h t l m which  the  staff rrently pects o ave  little  pact n  prices, uld  potentially  anslate  to cu ex t h im o co tr in greater  nflationary ssures  han  the taff s  forecast  f  usinesses  ttempt  o  maintain rofit i pre t s ha i b a t p margins  by  raising ices  o ffset  eclining oductivity.  milarly, e iminishing  ealth ffect pr t o d pr Si th d w e that  s xpected o  come from  the tock arket  may not  be  as  strong  s  the  staff s  forecast. i e t s m a ha

The  real tory  n  the irst lf  as that    stronger-than-expected  ance  in  private s i f ha w a adv demand was offset  y  a  sharper-than-expected  line  n  net xports, aving  DP  growth  about b dec i e le G unchanged.  That  outcome  suggests  t east    couple f uestions.  irst,  y did rivate  omestic a l a o q F wh p d demand accelerate?  econd,  why should  private  omestic emand now weaken so  sharply  s  in S d d a the  staff recast en there re o multiplier-accelerator ts  o  speak  of temming from o wh a n effec t s slower rowth  in  the irst lf?  One piece,  ut  only  a  piece,  f he uzzle f he urther g f ha b o t p o t f strengthening    private  emand may be  the  same Asian  turmoil  hat  as reflected    the in d t w in sharper-than-anticipated  ine  n  net  exports.  hat  turmoil  esulted   at  least  of he  per decl i T r in $3 t barrel  ecline  n  oil  rices  nd  was accompanied  by  a  shift  ortfolio  eferences  avor f d i p a inp pr inf o dollar-denominated  sets  hat  ontributed   lower ntermediate-  d  long-term nterest  tes  n as t c to i an i ra i the nited  States.

But  the ey  question  n he  forecast ,  hat  will ow induce  a  slower ate  f conomic k i t is w n r o e growth  in  the econd alf nd  into 999? It s ot  the xternal  rag.

Therefore,  n rder  or DP  growth  to  moderate  going  forward,  he lowing n  domestic i o f G t s i demand must  be  aggressive  nough  to  more than ffset e iminishing  xternal  rag.

Now, these pending omponents  are e t ha o s c projected  o eturn  o  fundamentals,  ence  the conomy slows.  There  is othing rong  with  this t r t h e n w story,  ut t  s ot n  overwhelmingly ompelling ne,  especially    terms  of he  timing f he b i i n a c o in t o t slowdown. As a  result, ave  some doubts bout  the egree f  the  slowdown in  the taff recast. I  h a d o s o

MR.  KELLEY. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  The morning  has  moved well long  and  I a am the  last  n he  queue,   believe,   I  will e  very rief.   the ast  eeting,  he ommittee  was i t I so b b At l m t C wrestling  ith  the  very  uncomfortable  ilemma  of aving wo  sets f oncerns hat  ulled  n  very w d h t o c t p i different  rections.    have  been  wrestling  ith  the ame concerns ll orning.  The  question di We w s a m for oday eems  to  be  what  has  changed  over he ast  ew weeks.  The answer  perhaps s hat  ot t s t l f i t n

much has  changed  fundamentally  nd  definitively,     think  here  re  some potentially  ry a butI t a ve significant  raws  n  the ind.  Thanks  to nventories  d  Asia, he xpansion lowed  dramatically st i w i an t e s as  expected  n  the econd  quarter, nfronting   now with  the uestion  f  whether  or  not his i s co us q o t moderation ill ettle   as  a  new regime  as  suggested  y  the reenbook.  I  thought he ase hat w s in b G t c t was made there as  quite mpressive.  ut  if  he tock arkets till  ve  the  stamina or ne  or w i B t s m s ha f o more bull uns  left  n  them,  confidence  ould e  reinforced d  we could gain  easily  ind r i c b an a f ourselves  n  an  excessive  rowth  mode for uch,  perhaps ll,  f  the orecast riod.  hat i g m a o f pe T obviously  ould resent  ignificant ficulties  he  long  run.  My  assessment  s hat  omestic c p s dif in  t i t d risk  emains n  the  upside ut  perhaps ot  so  heavily  s  earlier.  e next everal  onths  should r o b n a Th s m tell  hat  ale. t t

Internationally,    is ard  pressed  o dentify y  news of mprovement.  To the one h t i an i contrary, flationary  essure  eems  to e  increasing. pan  appears o  be  fumbling he all, de pr s b Ja t t b which  may further danger  the ntire  egion. ong-held ears  f  contagion  ith  some boost rom en e r L f o w f weak oil rices  ave  become reality  d  have  impacted ussia nd  parts  f atin merica. The p h an R a o L A downside  risk  eems  to ave  intensified side  ur  borders,  alling en  more strongly  or s h out o c ev f caution.

We  still  ve  the ifurcated x of  factors  hat  xisted  n  July  1.  My  sense,  owever, ha b mi t e o h is hat  or he  moment at  least,  e pside omestic oncerns ay be a  bit ilder hile  the t f t th u d c m m w downside  international cerns ay be  cause  for ven  more  caution. hile  both  of hese traws con m e W t s in  the ind now blow  in  the ame direction d  suggest    softening pansion s  a  rising w s an a ex a probability,  o  not  think hat  his  arrants    change  in  our olicy  tance t his  ime.

MR.  KOHN. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. In  opting  o  keep  the tance  f t s o policy  nchanged  at  recent  eetings,  he ommittee  has een  balancing  ts u m t C b i expectation at  olicy ost  likely  ill eed  eventually  o ighten  o orestall th p m w n t t t f an  uptrend n  inflation  ainst  he ossibilities  t  evelopments n  the i ag t p tha d i global conomy could  make that  ightening necessary  nd  that  ny  rise  n e t un a a i the  federal  unds ate  ight  worsen  instabilities reign  inancial  rkets. f r m in  fo f ma Living  with  the  risk  f ising flation  s  been  made easier  y  the ow  level o r in ha b l of  actual  nflation  d  by  the rospect  hat, spite  ight  abor  arkets, i an p t de t l m inflation  ll ot urn p  for ome time.  Given that  rospect, iting  o wi n t u s p wa t tighten--in  der o e  in   better  osition  udge  the ourse f or t b a p toj c o developments verseas  nd  inflation  namics  in  the nited tates--probably o a dy U S would  not  deprive  he ommittee of dequate ime  to  head  off    significant t C a t a pickup  in  inflation  at  ould  be  very isruptive   everse, en  allowing  or th w d tor ev f policy ags. l

Moreover,  the  reactions   U.S.  financial rkets f ate  o  the of ma o l t deteriorating  tuation  erseas  n  balance re einforcing  e  restraint si ov o a r th on aggregate emand.  This s n  contrast  arlier en domestic  markets ere d i i oe wh w responding  o  foreign  urmoil  n  ways that  eemed  to upport ore domestic t t i s s m spending,  artly  ffsetting  e amping of et xports.  o  be  sure,  nterest p o th d n e T i rates  n  Treasury bligations  ve  dropped  still rther,  t  the  adverse o o ha fu bu effects  f he igher ollar  nd  weaker  foreign  emand on  profit ospects o t h d a d pr have  contributed  portantly   the ecent  ecrease  n  equity  rices  nd  rise im to r d i p a in  credit  isk  preads.  he  cost f aising pital r .S.  businesses  robably r s T o r ca fo U p has  risen    bit n ecent  eeks,  and  previous  ains n ousehold ealth ave a i r w g i h w h been  trimmed.

In  addition, ch of he  decline  n  Treasury nterest  tes  n  the ast  ew mu t i i ra i l f weeks,  and  even  in  the ast w months, ay represent  fall  n  inflation l fe m a i expectations,  ther  han n  real nterest  tes, miting s  timulative  fect ra t i i ra li it s ef on spending. n  the ichigan  consumer  survey,  or xample, artial ta or I M f e p da f August  indicate  drop  in xpectations r nflation  er oth  the ext ear a e fo i ov b n y and  the ext  5  to  10  years;  xpectations er oth  horizons  ave  fallen n e ov b h a couple  of enths  n  the ast  wo  months, ringing  he ecline  n  median t i l t b t d i long-term  xpectations   half    percentage  oint  his  ear. sing  these e to a p t y U measures,  ate eclines  n  recent  onths  or  even  since  ecember entirely r d i m D reflect nger nflation  pectations. is  conclusion  s upported  y the lo i ex Th i s b slight  pward  creep n  yields  n  inflation-indexed  urities  er his  eriod. u i o sec ov t p It ay be  that  he ownward pressure  n  real nterest  tes  temming  from m t d o i ra s market  perceptions   greater straint  ming  from  abroad  are  being  about of re co offset  y  upward  pressure  rising om  increases   expected  eal hort-term b a fr in r s rates  ver  the ear erm  as  inflation  pectations  ll  elative   he orecast o n t ex fa r tot f of  an unchanged  nominal  funds  rate.

C d t ve

Perhaps  the mmediate  question  or ommittee  consideration   hether, i f C isw on  balance,  onditions  ave  changed  enough  to arrant   return  o  a c h w a t symmetrical  irective. e Greenbook  forecast uld seem  consistent th d Th wo wi such  a  move in  that,   an  unchanged  federal  unds ate,  t  ees nflation at f r i s i remaining uite amped.

Finally, en  if  he ommittee  views  inflation  sks  s  still  bstantial, ev t C ri a su it may also  see  recent  evelopments t  least  s  having ostponed he eed  for d a a p t n possible  ightening,  th  because reater  ragility  markets s ikely t bo g f in i l to persist r   while  and  because rice  ressures  hould e  quiescent  or fo a p p s b f a longer  eriod. f  ilts    the irective e  interpreted    having  a  time p I t in d ar as dimension  as  well s  connoting he  likely  irection  he ext olicy  ction, a t d oft n p a a  symmetrical irective  y better  epresent e  Committee's  ntentions. d ma r h i Until   few years go,  tilts  plied  o ossible  olicy  ctions  n he ery ear a a ap t p p a i t v n term--that ,  ver  the  intermeeting riod. hile  the ommittee has  not is o pe W C emphasized  this  nterpretation ecent  ears,  t  till s  seemed often o e i in  r y i s ha t b using ilts    signal  hat  isks  ere  sufficiently wed  to ake a  policy t to t r w ske m adjustment  n  the ndicated rection  distinct  ssibility r he  next i i i a po ove t several  eetings,  nd  not ust    statement  f robabilities he  indefinite m a j a o p in  t future.

Still,  mmittee  members have  been  projecting re inflation  an  has Co mo th the  staff,  d  the ommittee  may see  the  risks  f igher  nflation    large an C o h i as enough  and  immediate nough to ustify  taining e  asymmetric  directive. e j re th Declines n  equity  rices  nd  greater reign  urmoil  ay have  reduced our i p a fo t m y inflation  ncerns,  ut erhaps ot  by  enough  to hange  the  directive.  e co b p n c Th fundamental ituation    the conomy has  not  changed.

In  this  eriod,  ayroll  mployment  has  risen .2 e i t p s m p p e 1 million  nd  the djusted  ousehold igure  as  declined  00,000--a  ifference  .6  million  t  an a a h f h 6 d of3 a annual  rate.   small art f  the arger  iscrepancy  pparently  elates   underestimates  llegal A p o l d a r to ofi immigration,  hich  bias own the opulation  ata nd, herefore,  e ousehold ata. here  are w d p d a t th h d T some other mall echnical  ssues  n  both  the ayroll  nd  the ousehold ata hose resolution s t i i p a h d w would  tend o  reduce hat  iscrepancy, t nly  marginally. t t d bu o

The serious  uestion  hat  e have  at his  tage s ow significant   tightening  he q t w t s i h the int labor  arket  has  been  over he  last  ix onths  and  the ast  ear.  Certainly er he ast  ix m t s m l y ov t l s months,  the umber of nemployed people  plus hose ho are  not  in  the  labor  orce ut  want  a n u t w f b job  has  not hanged.  To be  sure,  hat  umber has  stabilized  a  level  hat  till plies    very ight c t n at t s im a t labor arket,  ut  one  that  s ot ightening rther. is  story,  s  you are  well  aware, s uite m b i n t fu Th a i q different  om  the  one  we get y  merely  looking t  the ayroll  ata,  hich still ow a  relatively fr b a p d w sh strong  onth-by-month  growth  pattern.  omething  is ifferent re. e  do  not  know what  it  s. m S d he W i It nfortunately  rns  ut  to e  in   very  crucial  rea or he nalysis  f hat  is oing  on  in  the u tu o b a a f t a o w g labor  arket. m

As some of  you  have  indicated,   are  not ven  quite  ure hat  the nflation  te  s. we e s w i ra i Until 995,  the nflation  te,  f  e wished  to  measure  consumer  price  nflation,  evidently 1 i ra i w i was fairly ose o  the ore  CPI and  core CE rates, ich  did ot  diverge reatly. ince hen,  ven cl t c P wh n g S t e without  he  methodological  djustments  ffecting e  CPI core,  he  gap  in  the  two  rates  f t a a th t o inflation  s  opened  up.  We  are ow dealing,  or xample, ith  a 12-month  change  in  the  PCE ha n f e w core  deflator at  n  June  was about  a  full  ercentage  oint  ess  han he PI  core.  So,  at   crucial th i p p l t t C a nexus  in  our fforts   make  judgments  about he nflation  ocess,  ur  data ave  deserted  s, f e to t i pr o h u i I may put  it  hat  ay. We  are  in   position ere  it  s ery ifficult   eel omfortable  bout  what t w a wh i v d tof c a is appening. h

To make matters orse,  when we look  at  the roductivity  ta,  t  learly kes a  big w p da i c ma difference ether  we measure  output n  the asis f  the  product ide f he ational counts r wh o b o s o t n ac o on  the  income  side n  light  f he ontinued  idening  of he  statistical  crepancy.  he i o t c w t dis T discrepancy  eflects  self  ite  easurably n  the nalysis  f nit osts  nd  prices.  hen  we look r it qu m i a o u c a W at  productivity  asured  from  the  income  side--which  e used  to o  in  the LS  data nd  we are me w d B a

However,  as  the t s a u c i ar s qu s expansion lows, he  labor  arkets  appear o  be  sufficiently ht  o  that  ndividual ployers  are s t m t tig s i em quite eluctant    lay eople  off.  s a  consequence,  ncreases  n  measured  productivity  ow r to p A i i sl down of  necessity. is s nother ay of  saying hat  he  unemployment rate  s   lagging Th i a w t t i a indicator.

In  any  event,  e are  at   point  here  a  critical  aluation  equired  or s  to w a w ev isr f u understand  he nflation  ocess.   still ink  hat  ost  of he  evidence,  rrespective   he ata e t i pr I th t m t i oft d w are  looking t,  learly  hows  that  nflation   ow,  labor  arkets re  tight,  d  compensation er a c s i isl m a an p hour  is ccelerating.  e productivity  ta,  s  measured  on  both  the roduct nd  the  income a Th da a p a sides,  re eflected    muted  increases  n nit abor osts  hat  oupled ith he ecline  n  unit a r in i u l c t c w t d i non-labor  osts  esult   a  still nign nflation  ocess.  ut  our  evaluation  ould  be  a  lot ore c r in be i pr B w m convincing f  e had  a  set f ata hat  ere  internally  nsistent  d  did ot eave s  with  very i w o d t w co an n l u large,  awning  gaps  in  significant ces  n  the  statistics. y pla i

As of  today,   ee  no  likelihood atsoever hat  e a v i Is wh t w would  decide o  move the  rate  etween  now and  the ext eeting,  nd  I  think ur  next ate  ove t b n m a o r m is qually  ikely  o e  up  or own. e l t b d Whatever  one's  heological  ew  of ow the ommittee t vi h C reaches ts  ecisions  n  symmetry or  asymmetry,  one  would  conclude hat    symmetric  directive i d o t a most  clearly  eflects  e urrent  hinking  f he embers. r th c t o t m

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Rivlin.

MS. RIVLIN.  I  agree,  r.  Chairman,  that    symmetric  directive  kes sense t his M a ma a t moment. Such a  directive  flects   view  that  e are  unlikely  o hange  monetary  policy re my w t c anytime  soon  and  that, en we do,  we may move the  fed unds  rate  p  or  down. Now, I  have wh f u been  wrong before. e  all ave  been  wrong  before. he  only  argument  that   ee  for ot W h T Is n changing  the ilt   he act hat  t oes  not ave  much operational gnificance  d  moving it t ist f t i d h si an around  a  lot  isks  ur  looking   little  lly   e turn ut  to e  wrong about he alance f  risks. r o a si if w o b t b o So,  I  ould o  along  with  the trong rgument  for eaving  he  tilt ere  it  s,  ut y preference c g s a l t wh i b m would  be  to  adopt   symmetric  directive. a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Meyer.

MR. MEYER. Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  First,  trongly  upport  our I  s s y recommendation  for o  change  in  policy  t his  eeting,  ut  ant  to  focus y attention    the n a t m b Iw m on

issue  f  symmetry  versus symmetry. In  my view,  the ery  tight  abor arkets mpose  a  natural o a v l m i asymmetry  to  policy  n elation   growth  prospects.  pecifically,  orecast  ersistent i r to S a  f ofp above-trend  rowth  would,  I  believe, stify ighter licy, t  a  forecast  f odestly g ju a  t po bu o m below-trend  rowth  would  not  immediately  ictate   easier  olicy.  nstead, ch  a  development g d an p I su would  help o  unwind  the ery  tight bor arkets nd  contribute    a soft  anding ith  maximum t v la m a to l w sustainable owth  and  full  mployment. This,    believe,   the oundation  or he  asymmetric gr e I is f f t bias oward  tighter licy  hat  e have  maintained  ince he arch meeting.  I  still  lieve  hat t po t w s t M be t very  tight  abor  arkets nd  likely  rowth  near r  above  trend ill ltimately ctate at  he ext l m a g o w u di th t n move for he  funds ate ill e  up  rather  han  down. This alance f isks  s est onveyed  by  the t r w b t b o r i b c current  ilt   policy. t in

But  there s   second  asymmetry  in  the utlook oday. his  asymmetry  relates i a o t T to probable utcomes  versus  entral  endency orecasts r apan  and  emerging  economies  in  Asia o c t f fo J and  elsewhere.  Relative  o  such  a  baseline  orecast,  ere  s n  my view  a  considerably eater t f th i i gr risk  f  a  much  worse  outcome  in  those conomies  than here  s f  a  much more benign  result. o e t i o I see  this  ownside  risk  f   worse  case  outcome  in  Asia,  hould t  aterialize,  likely   spread o d o a s i m as to t other  merging  market conomies  and  constituting  ost  serious  hreat  o he .S.  and  the e e them t t t U global conomies.  Such a  worse  case  outcome  does  not  have  the ighest  robability,  t  s he e h p buti i t most  worrisome  possibility t  e face oday.  On balance,  herefore, hink    symmetric  posture tha w t t I  t a is he  best hoice or ow. t c f n

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President nehan. Mi

MS. MINEHAN. I, oo, m in  agreement ith  your  recommendation  of  alternative t a w B. I  have  mixed  feelings out  whether r  not o  change  the  symmetry  of  our irective   his ab o t d att meeting.  The reason s hat    continue  o  believe  hat  ur  next ove should e  to  raise  he ederal i t I t t o m b t f

funds  rate,  nd  I  think  e would  be  better  ff ight  ow from  the oint  f  view  of peculation a w o r n p o s in financial rkets,  redit  arkets,  nd  real state  arkets f  e had  moved to  a  tighter licy ma c m a e m i w po stance  arlier. wever,  there re  a  lot  f  worrisome  downside  risks  ight  ow coming  from  the e Ho a o r n external  ector  f he conomy. There  is  sense f  spreading  ragility  road  and  a  possibility s o t e a o f ab of a  feedback o  our wn financial  rkets. iven  the  sense f  caution  hat    feel o  a  greater  egree t o ma G o t I t d now than  I  did  at he ast  eeting,    think  he eed  for    move has  been  pushed  off ntil  e see t l m I t n a u w what  the mpact  of arious  volving  vents broad  will  e  on  our conomy. So,  I  can  go  along i v e e a b e with  what  seems  to  be  the onsensus o  far  hat  e move to  an  unbiased  irective. c s t w d

When  I  listen   the  discussion out sia  around  the able,  t  eems  to e that to ab A t i s m people  are  saying hat  ome of hese ountries e ot  yet  in  bad  enough  shape  to  fix.  o  not t s t c ar n Id know how our  taking  ction  or he urpose  of elping hem  creates  he ressures  or hem  to  help a f t p h t t p f t themselves.

MR. JORDAN. The other hing n which  we as  economists  lace ore emphasis  was t o p m his ork with  Oskar  Morgenstern n  the  calculus  f ecisionmaking  sing athematical w o o d u m formulations  f  the inimax type.

The  analysis  o  carefully ne  and  mathematically veloped y  von f s s do de b Neumann  and  Morgenstern  basically ys  that  e sometimes  should ase  decisions  n  something sa w b o that  e not  only o  not elieve  nd  definitely    not ant, ut hat  s  still e  wisest  ourse f w d b a do w b t i th c o action.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  oskow. M

MR. MOSKOW. Mr.  Chairman,  I  support  our  recommendation  for  "no  change"  in y policy. n the irective,    s  a  close  all.    think  hat  n  balance he isks  re  still rginally  n O d it i c I t o t r a ma o the  upside. o,  I  would  have  a  slight eference  or n  asymmetric irective  t  I  can  support S pr f a d bu a symmetric  directive.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  uynn. G

MR. GUYNN. I  prefer  lternative  as  well.  I  am at he ame place s  Governor a B t s a Kelley.  I  have  a  slight eference r ontinuing  he symmetrical irective,   east  or   while pr fo c t a d atl f a longer.  It eems  to  me that  iven he xtraordinary  sibility   publicity  he  Asian  and s g t e vi and oft Russian  problems,  e could ive  too  much weight  today o  those ssues  efore e have  some w g t i b w greater  ssurance  hat  omestic inal  emand will low  to  a  pace  that  s onsistent  th o a t d f d s i c wi n deterioration  inflation.  lso ave  some concern  about he  confusing  ignal  ffect  f ur in I  a h t s e o o delayed nnouncement  of  the  symmetry  in  the irective,   I  would  feel ore  comfortable  ith a d and m w moving to  a symmetrical  irective  day  if  e were  on  a  regime  of nnouncing hat  ecision d to w a t d promptly  after  ach  meeting.  However,  I  do  not eel trongly  bout he  symmetry  issue. e f s a t

MR.  VARVEL. We  would agree hat  he ownside  risks  ave  increased, t e still t t d h bu w believe  hat  he pside isks  re  greater, ven  the trength  n  domestic emand.
