Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Over the intermeeting period, global economic data and increased prospects global policy accommodation that led, on balance, to an easing in could continue for a somewhat longer period of time and accumulate to a area, led to a sharp decline in U.S. Treasury and foreign sovereign bond yields. broad appreciation against the yen. MR. POTTER. 1 investors noted a broad weakening of for effective financial conditions.  In the United States, investors appeared to conclude that asset purchases somewhat larger size.  This, in combination with the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) aggressive easing program and shifting prospects for additional accommodation in the euro Meanwhile, prices of domestic risk assets were modestly higher, while the dollar index was little changed despite significant equity markets and economic expectations that across G-10 and associated shifts in were mixed but little changed, expectations for a rate cut by the United States, recent weakness in economic Fed purchases, and the S&amp;P 500 2 percent higher over the period.  Meanwhile, equity gains in Japan were 11 percent in local currency terms BOJ's new measures aimed at ending Japan's persistent history of will now seek to achieve 2 percent inflation within government bonds (JGBs). Exhibit 1 begins with trends in advanced-economy data.  As seen in the upper-left panel, despite recent deterioration in economic data, G-10 equity markets were relatively resilient, supported by monetary policy will remain accommodative and that fiscal policy in the euro area may be somewhat less restrictive.  The variation in equity performance countries appears linked, in part, to changes in policy stances growth outlooks.  Core euro-area equity indexes though they rose in recent days on growing European Central Bank (ECB).

The middle-right panel contrasts the maturity profile of central banks' sovereign debt portfolios relative to the overall market.  While the SOMA portfolio's average maturity-or WAM-is shorter than the WAM of the Treasury market as traditionally been of much shorter maturity than the overall JGB market.  Under the BOJ's announced purchase plan, the WAM of its portfolio is projected to be close to the WAM of the overall and 30-year JGBs initially declined 12 to 30 basis yields have retraced, though, on net, 10-year and 30-year 15 to 30 basis points below their late-February levels, when a contributing factors to the retracement, though it is difficult to quantify them It may reflect uncertainty about the appropriate level BOJ's stated 2 percent inflation.  Since the new easing measures were 20 basis points and remains well below the new 2 percent and other market-based While investors were expecting some shift of purchases to longer-dated JGBs, the size of the shift was significantly larger than had been expected.  As seen in the lower-left panel, yields on 10-year points.  Subsequently, JGB yields remain expectations for longer-duration asset purchases began to firm.  There is likely range of or even rank their importance: of rates under the new policy regime, given the size of purchases and the intent of achieving introduced, 1-year inflation compensation 2 years forward derived from inflation swaps has risen by only objective.  However, given modest trading activity, these inflation measures might not accurately reflect a shift in inflation expectations.

yields may also reflect market concerns about the smooth asset purchases.  Initially, the BOJ announced that it net new purchases and ongoing The recent rise in JGB implementation of such sizable would conduct purchases on just six days per month with minimal guidance on the maturity ranges of purchase operations.

Investors suggest that increased bond allocations would likely be to high-quality sovereign markets such as the United States, Australia, and core European countries, though emerging market economies are also expected to see some inflows.

This period also included a number of weak U.S. data points, including the March employment report, so it is likely that shifting balance sheet expectations as well as anticipated portfolio rebalancing by Japanese investors contributed to the decline.

This is because the TBA trading to be delivered into transactions.  In a TBA transaction, the seller typically the cheapest-to-deliver As a result of this dynamic, each month we are delivered both newly issued MBS and securities that were produced some time ago.  This is reflected in the age of the loans backing the securities we are being delivered, seen in the middle-left panel.

There was the initial shock of how large the program was, and I think get the intraday moves on Bloomberg quite accurately. there was the issue of how easily the Bank of Japan could actually implement year.  That kind of volatility tends to or not wanting to trade them.  So that The fact that those yields stayed higher relative to announcement of the purchase program is interesting.

This underestimates, on that day, the movement in the JGB market; we cannot actually There was a lot of turbulence; it is really hard to read anything into that.  And then, as I discussed in the briefing, purchase programs of that size-and the size is both the net purchases and the fact that they don't roll over at auction, which means that they were looking at about Â¥7Â½ trillion per month of purchases that they had to do across these six operations.  I think that produced a lot of volatility.

If mind here is the methodology we've used historically to estimate the purchases, and I wonder consistent with some of we're trying to show, from the ones that they followed before. MR. POTTER.  I would be wary of trying to use JGBs.  I would use the currency and the equity markets.  The movements we have seen in those would be very what we expect to happen to financial conditions from large-scale asset purchases.  But it is not a clean experiment because they've had deflation for about 20 years, and this is a very different policy, as

Lacker, if I could just add a few thoughts that echo Simon's? I think it is worth keeping in mind that JGB yields had actually fallen a lot in a lot of the effect was already built in, and for why, subsequently, yields didn't move a lot.  That's one MR. KAMIN.  President First of all, anticipation of the program.  So a lot of the response to expectations of more monetary easing was kind of built in.  Now, indeed, everybody, including us, was surprised by how large the program was.  But, in some sense, you might say maybe that's part of the explanation thing we're keeping in mind.

Obviously, a model simulation is not proof or A second point, getting back to the issue of the expectations may have been at play:  I'll be referring in my we've done using our models.  In those simulations, the term premium on JGBs actually enormously, by 200 basis points, but because inflation rises in the simulation, the 10-year JGB yield only falls

In the end, however, we didn't see the data as strongly at odds with our previous forecast, in part because we step-down in economic growth this quarter.  Likewise, although we made material changes to our assumptions for fiscal policy were largely offsetting in terms of their effects on activity.  The result is a real-side forecast that is not significantly different from our

Starting with the labor market data, the March employment report implied a slightly lower unemployment rate than we had expected, but also a weaker pace of

average three-month previous payroll job gains.  Specifically, the unemployment rate in March edged down 0.1 percentage point, to 7.6 percent; we were expecting it to hold steady at 7.7 percent.  By contrast, private payroll employment rose by only 95,000 last month, almost 100,000 less than we had expected.  However, this downside miss was accompanied by upward revisions to earlier months, leaving the change in private payrolls at 170,000 per month, only 20,000 less than our projection.

In particular, we now expect the unemployment rate to average 7.6 percent percentage point less than our March Tealbook projection, We have taken both of these surprises on board in our near-term labor market forecast. in the current quarter, 0.1 and have reduced our forecast for private payroll growth by 20,000 per month through June to 160,000 per month.

In addition, the downward surprise in energy prices since the last meeting led us to boost our forecast for personal income support for spending.  On the downside, near-term indicators of business fixed investment, including the latest readings on nondefense capital business sentiment, were relatively lackluster.  And the BEA's estimates of contributions to economic growth in the first quarter from federal spending, net exports, and inventories all surprised us to the downside.  In the end, the pluses and minuses roughly cancel forecast of real GDP 2Â¼ percent, unrevised from the March Tealbook.

Likewise, our medium-term headline inflation forecast is little changed from March. headline inflation to run at an annual rate of half of this year seems refer, of course, to the Spring Meetings of IMF and World Bank.  But even here, the mood was somewhat somber as facing the global economy.  These concerns recover from its anemic pace of end of the forecast.  However, we now come back to the fore. MR. KAMIN.  Several weeks ago, Washington celebrated its annual rite of spring, a time when hope triumphs over experience, and when the coming sure to bring better things than the last.  I the participants pondered the sharp decline in Chinese economic growth, continued churning in Europe, and other headwinds were on our minds, too, as we put together the Tealbook forecast.  As in March, we still anticipate that foreign GDP growth will 2Â¼ percent in 2012 to 3Â½ percent by the expect a somewhat slower pickup in the near term, and some of the downside risks we thought had diminished have

Viewing this Chinese growth to moderate to 8Â½ percent in the first quarter, but it instead appears to have plummeted to 6Â½ percent.  Of course, seasonally adjusting Chinese GDP data is difficult, and the reliability of these statistics is questionable.  Nevertheless, we believe the slowing was for real, and our indicator industrial production, imports, and retail sales, predicts a similar decline in Data for other emerging China's deceleration may have spilled over to its neighbors.

Rather, with the weakness widespread categories of private domestic demand, we judge the underlying gradually back to 8 percent-near what we end of this year.  That said, the risks of further We cannot identify why Chinese expected.

Since last his more than 200 basis points on net, but bank lending rates have fallen by much less, credit availability remains very tight, and the demand for loans is quite depressed.  By our reckoning, it will take considerable time to restart the process of lending and investment, especially in peripheral Europe, and this is one of the factors that will keep growth in Europe so subdued.

from the last couple of times.  So I'd like to ask three questions, actually, about the you'd indulge me.  One is on Europe, one is on consumption, and one is on MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My business reports this time were somewhat different Tealbook outlook, if the labor market.

economic growth recovering fairly decently in the next couple years, and I'm still struggling to understand the underpinnings of how Europe is going to get does economic growth differ across the your scenario, and in particular, Germany?  Are you expecting Germany to be an growth that pulls other countries along in Europe?  How does that square with the export-led growth strategy?  Those are the questions I'm struggling with. we seeing any evidence of the wage and price adjustments necessary to boost the I mean, we must be seeing adjustments, but do you In Europe, you're seeing of out from under this.  So, a couple of things.  How countries in engine of traditional German And are competitiveness of the periphery countries? think they're close to the necessary degree for them to become competitive?

Right.  I'd like to start off by saying that we are, indeed, predicting recovery in Europe, among other contract forever.  It has [laughter] that is a common rationale extreme.

April 30-May 1, 2013

MR. EVANS.  Even Japan is coming back, yes.

As I emphasized in my remarks, it's a very tepid recovery, in the sense end of the period, we have an output gap for the euro area that's only a little bit of GDP.  In our forecast for year, 2013, from Q4 to Q4, there's basically zero economic growth in the euro area.  That's next year, which is in the neighborhood of potential, and then 2 percent year after, which is higher than potential.  By this metric, this is an extremely tepid recovery, years after their recession first started, at the end of 2007it was at the previous peak, rate, at 12 percent, is extremely elevated.  To be sure, this is a very means that in 2015 they will probably regard themselves as still being in MR. KAMIN. that, by the smaller than it is right now, in the neighborhood of 4 percent this followed by 1.3 percent the and it means that by 2015-eight their level of GDP is just getting back to the neighborhood of where and their unemployment gloomy forecast, and it recession.

it?  Well, there are some concrete factors.  One of that, certainly, the pace of fiscal consolidation in the forecast is going to lessen, and for a little bit more concrete, we estimate last year was in the neighborhood of 1Â½ percent of GDP, which is pretty hefty. year, it should be a little under 1 percent, and then next year and the year after, below should start growing a little bit.  As a bit of publicity lately-sort of a backlash against fiscally quarter of a percentage point-not a great deal, but that's certainly a Number two is the fact that much of the recession that took place was because of soaring wake of a panic about the fiscal sustainability of governments and the That said, what do we think is driving them is other reasons, as they achieve their fiscal goals.  To be their fiscal drag This Â½ percent.  That, right there, is one concrete reason why they you may have noted, there's been quite austerity-and we have, in fact, reduced the extent to which we think they're going to be consolidated by maybe a factor. sovereign spreads in the

April 30-May 1, 2013

spreads fall a great deal.  We have seen and CDS spreads fall a great deal.  We've seen these improvements, as I that tends to take place with a lag, but to see that as well.  Finally, as regards the pattern within Europe of these different to be an engine of growth per se, dragging year, even as euro-area economic growth is zero, we anticipate Germany growth of about not really enough to drag the whole continent situation of banks.  We have seen these sovereign spreads on bank lending emphasized in my remarks.  We have yet to see those pass through to actual lending and borrowing conditions because we know by experience that we do expect adjustments, we're not really counting on Germany everybody else along.  In our forecast, Germany certainly does better than other countries.  For this 1 percent, rising to 2 percent afterward, but that's along.

relative prices within the euro area?  Yes, to some unit labor cost growth in the peripheral the northern economies.  It's not a great deal.  It may not even be It is also true that with regard to current account due less to improvements in relative competitiveness than it is to the import recessions.  But, as I say, there are some initial indications of progress going to involve a lot of hardship Are adjustments being made, as far as extent.  We are actually seeing some tailing-off of economies compared with enough to answer those critics who say that the peripheral countries would be better off breaking away and devaluing, although that has its own problems.  But certainly they're on the road toward slow adjustments in relative prices. balances, which is another way we measure that type of improvement in competitiveness, the peripheral economies have substantially reduced their current account deficits.  But that is probably compression due to their on the unit labor cost front.  So putting all these things together, we do see a road toward normality for these countries, but it is a difficult road, and it's

April 30-May 1, 2013

going to be a while before the global economy or the United States' growth in economic activity in Europe. on the way.  And it's economy benefits substantially from higher consumption.  The Tealbook has fairly subdued investment.  Given what I hear from business contacts, that seems growth in consumption and goes along with this is that of a virtuous cycle:  Consumption increases because employment goes up; goes up because consumption increases; and that feeds on itself.  I'm having a little egg problem here.  Which one is going to go first?  How go on without participation by businesses?  If they're cautious about lot of firms are telling me that they'd rather got the fiscal drag from the Can you make me feel better about this? MR. EVANS.  Right.  Thank you.  If I can ask about forecast reasonable; if anything, the Tealbook may be on the optimistic side.  Despite the weakness in business investment, the Tealbook forecast has a pretty decent housing.  The story that because disposable income rises; disposable income rises employment bit of trouble with the chicken and the long can this cycle investment, won't they be cautious about hiring?

As you say, we think that over time the economy is going to as some of the things that are holding down economic growth now are going to wane. year.  But that drag is going to lessen, in terms of its years, and that should contribute to more as that happens, growth now, will improve over time, again, as part MR. WASCHER.  I don't know.  I think our business investment outlook isn't superb, but we have E&amp;S business investment recover Fiscal policy, in particular, is a big drag this effects on economic growth, over the next couple of consumption and income growth and employment and so forth.  Moreover, confidence, which we also think is restraining of this virtuous circle.  And going along with that, we continue to expect some gradual

April 30-May 1, 2013

are still tight now.  I don't know if that makes improvements in credit availability where things you feel any better, but that's the story we have in there.

I'd add to that is I think you can make an argument housing market.  I don't want to get carried are getting better there slowly, and that's an example of this sort of thing.  It has back, but I think there is evidence that that is as if MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  One thing that you see the start of this virtuous circle in the away, but things got a ways to go before the economy is all the way occurring.  Consumer durables, particularly auto sales, have come back quite a bit.  It's not the household sector is dead in the water; it is slowly improving.

you'll indulge me, on the labor market middle left that shows the improvement in the outlook like a part of the improvement is what we've seen so actual unemployment rate, which decline in the gap between the unemployment rate one reading of yesterday's briefing document, I think.  Yet we haven't closing of the gap between the labor force participation rate and its trend. fact, it has widened by a couple of tenths.  This could temper one's views about how much MR. EVANS.  Okay, thanks.  Lastly, if improvement, you have the chart on the for unemployment relative to the September outlook.  The improvement looks sort of parallel shift down in the projected half.  So a big far.  Since September, we've seen a decent-sized decline in the I think the Tealbook assumes is almost all a and the NAIRU.  That's seen a corresponding In labor market slack has been closed.  What do you think is going on with these two margins?

The unemployment rate has clearly come down faster than we had growth has been stronger than September.  The level of payroll employment is about a million higher the end of the forecast than we were anticipating back in September.  So I think it has been MR. WASCHER. expected back in September, and, correspondingly, employment we had expected back in by the case that there has been, basically, more improvement in the labor market in terms of

April 30-May 1, 2013

workforces back toward more sustainable levels In terms of participation, I think that often lags. you get some more persistent and more definitive improvements in the labor market, we do and So while we may not have seen that yet, it actually may be too early to at this point. employment and the unemployment rate than we, certainly, would have expected.  Our interpretation of that was that the level of potential output was lower and that firms were doing some more catch-up in terms of bringing their after having slashed them during the recession. As expect the participation rate to move back toward a declining trend.  And over the forecast period, that is what we have-we have the participation rate basically moving sideways moving toward its trend. clearly see that the broader measures of underemployment-the various U's-tend to show similar employment, you can bring in discouraged workers, and sorts of things, and you still see similar patterns-not identical, but similar patterns-to the those broader measures. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Related to that as well, it's not just the standard unemployment rate; patterns.  So you can bring in part-time those unemployment rate in

MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Yes.  And we did.

April 30-May 1, 2013

a lot of movement after the election but it really seems like those did not show after the big policy innovation from the Bank of Japan.  Do you have any MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  That's helpful.  And I had a question about Japan.  We've been tracking zero-coupon inflation swaps in Japan, and that's an illiquid market, as was pointed out.  They showed much movement at all thoughts on that?

I made earlier to President a large program.  People expected a very large and very aggressive program, your data show, those data move up from something under Â½ percent, in terms of now.  So that is pretty substantial.  Now, logic you pointed guess, as I we'll just have to follow it closely. MR. KAMIN.  Well, I think that echoes back to the point Lacker, which is that there was an awful lot of movement in markets in anticipation of the announcement of and, as expected inflation, to something like 1Â½ percent would entail that when the program was announced, and it was even bigger, that inflation expectations would rise even more, but they didn't.  So it's a bit of a mystery.  As out, the market is not too liquid, so it's a little hard to decipher these things.  My best say, is that most of it was baked in the cake, and market participants didn't quite know how to react to that remaining hunk of unexpected purchases;

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Okay.  Thank you.

Lacker. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions?  President

I could just follow up on that.  So that makes the fall and then yields more problematic, it seems to me.  Because if you don't have expected LSAP effects in the United States because we use these little, announcement effect windows, which is what I was getting at. MR. LACKER.  Yes.  If snapback in JGB inflation as the explanation for the return to the previous level, the initial response to the announcement looks sort of spurious and transitory.  And if that's true, that sort of undermines our approach to estimating the narrow

April 30-May 1, 2013

Lacker, that's why I said it was even bigger if you did the MR. POTTER.  President intraday window, which is hard to see with what we have.

MR. LACKER.  Right.  It could be even more misleading.

data because they will know some of the technical features with them.  They definitely announcement.  Given the announcement was about that, if it was perfect, to get them close to what they should be getting if they are credible.  And, so far, there is MR. POTTER.  It would be even more misleading.  I think with the inflation swaps, we really need to wait and think that the Bank of Japan is probably the best source for trying to look at these did increase substantially leading up to the double what people thought, you would expect 2 percent because that's nothing in that market that suggests that's true.

I guess my best guess would be that it's just very difficult to get a clear premiums, and other factors at the moment. MR. KAMIN. read on what is happening to expected inflation, term It has just been a period of some confusion, and we are hoping that, over the passage of time, things will clarify.

Also, I don't think it's correct to say that in the United States, Tealbook, Book B, about event studies.  Those are based on a model. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. we rely just on event studies.  For example, the estimates reported in LSAP effects on term premiums are uninformed by something else entirely. MR. LACKER.  That's

else entirely.  I would say there are three MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Yes, something different methodologies, one of which is event studies.

April 30-May 1, 2013

intraday movement, or CUSIP-by-CUSIP responses.  All three of them point to the same rough ballpark estimates.

Going forward, I would hope that we would get a little bit more clarity, as further evolutions of inflation swaps and other measures of inflation expectations.  But, approach we can take once enough of these asset purchases have been MR. KAMIN. we see presumably, one other made is to look cross-sectionally at impacts of these purchases on yields.  But that is work down the road.

That we are employing a smaller September, that those of growth over the last quarter has averaged less than 200,000 jobs per month are several why the labor market.

The economy's speed, as measured by changed significantly since last September's forecast.  As a result, it is taking too long to get to most measures of full employment.  More specifically, in terms of been little change. virtually the same.  However, the September Tealbook was based on an assumption of no balance sheet expansion, while the current Tealbook has much more accommodation included.

The April forecast Furthermore, inflation developments since last September are worth highlighting.  The March 2013 reading for core PCE inflation is 1.1 percent on a 12-month basis.  The same reading also applies to the 6-month measure.  Relative to September, the April Tealbook forecast for core PCE inflation this Similarly, is only 1.0 percent.

MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'm going to start with a comment on the 11th CEO contacts; make a about; and then, following the tradition of President hand as to how

District-and I want to stress this because of the prosperity we've a job-creating machine-our economy has grown growth is running about good news:  Existing home fire.  The inventory of available homes has fallen to the lowest level since the a significant amount of all-cash and absentee-buyers which has been particularly robust in the major metropolitan areas, with one source group buying 200 homes in Dallas alone.  One broker-as I reported to With regard to the 11th been enjoying and the fact that we have been at a moderate pace over the last six weeks.  Payroll employment 2.1 percent; that's the average long-term growth rate.  There is some sales are on Clinton Administration.  We're seeing activity, reporting an investment

There's actually a bill in the legislature, but its fate will I've discovered is that even among the most goes.  But it is interesting to note that the underwriters have said we will be able to $5 billion at less than 5 percent for 100-year bonds, taxables. you by telephone, Mr. Chairman-a woman named Allie Beth Allman, reported a in home sales last double counting on both sides of the transaction-where she's able to do it-that's a pretty robust number.  So that's good news.  Tax revenues are approaching its constitutional limit.  It may soon more, and there is serious discussion, on the good news side, in the legislature about issuing 100-year taxable revenue bond tied to infrastructure, such as bridges, roads, and water.  Major political figures have depend on political horse-trading, and one thing conservative, anti-debt, anti-tax people, they always want something for their district.  So we'll see how that place more than employment numbers.  Jobs 4 percent in December, up Â½ percent in January, up 7 percent in February, and down are the Dallas Fed's recent manufacturing, service, and retail surveys.  I would note that conducted between April 16 and April 24, so they're the most recent of all the Federal Bank surveys, but on the other hand, they are in keeping with the negative tone of those surveys.  As to manufacturing, our manufacturing survey indicates that activity is ebbing. orders index was negative for the first time this year.  Our backlogs in negative.  Among manufacturers' perceptions of broader business five months.  Cap-ex has declined in our District.  In this last survey of The bad news is that we've seen significant volatility in our were up 0.8 percent in March.  I don't know what that tells us, but it's of note.  Of greater concern results of the they were Reserve recent The new manufacturing volume of shipments are positions, they've worsened in April, and our index of future business activity reported its first negative reading in over

Zero percent said that they would increase percent say they have no idea what our manufacturers, and we drilled in specifically on the issue of health-care costs.  When asked about this, 81 percent of those surveyed expect health-care reform their employee costs.  Fifty-six employees directly or to employment until they had clarity on this front.  Forty-one the cost impact is likely to be.  So it is not a very positive development in the manufacturing sector.

and hours worked both rose a bit.  Prices and wage premiums increased concern is that respondents' expectations In the service sector, as reported this morning by the New York Fed's AMDATA mailbox, which we appreciate, activity slowed in April.  The revenue index, which is a key measure of service-sector conditions, while remaining positive, fell to its lowest level in nine months.  Employment slightly but were nothing to write home about.  And of of future business conditions in the service sector, while still positive, are declining.

Prices and wages were unchanged, but, again, as with the manufacturers and the service-sector providers generally, perceptions of broader economic activity were outlook fell sharply.

less-than-peppy tone in what, again, has been heretofore a very prosperous area and of national and international CEOs.  In fact, served in the Carter Administration, Mr. Chairman, I would use the word 'malaise' to mood among the CEOs. This continues to be so was reflected in my soundings had I not describe the current

April 30-May 1, 2013

and rails and airlines and express delivery and telephonics; retailers, and the sellers of the working man's elixir, as I like to call it, beer is the There was little anecdotal evidence of inflationary or deflationary price pressures. I talked to continues to drive productivity and cost containment.  This even the way.  It's interesting to talk to the casual-dining restaurant are now putting in place what they call 'labor cost enhancers,' and what that count.  Like everybody else is truckers like Swift report that price year-over-year transportation gains.  With regard to food prices, the will reflect this, but they are reporting price grains of up to 10 percent.  But they note that the global food inventories 'are expect restocking to begin in earnest in October, at expect prices to come back but remain contained. The sum total of my soundings of the truckers and logistics firms and tech companies; the regular manufacturers including restaurants; following: Every single contact relates to casual dining, by owners.  They means is they've reduced their kitchen costs and their waiter trying to do, they're driving productivity.  The big competition among truckers is increasing.  So there is some downward price pressure there, despite increasing miles in large food producers report that crop conditions are creating a little bit of price deflation presently.  Perhaps our president from Kansas City declines in the running on fumes,' to quote one, and they which time they strong in housing-related areas, and the rails report that every aspect of go in, fixtures and so on, has robust volume.  And I found to be one of the more interesting indicators is that according to Anheusercoming back to the United States.  The volume of beer consumption Obviously, housing is strong nationwide.  There are two indicators of interest that one doesn't typically hear, and I'd like to mention them.  Among the rails, we've had 22 consecutive months of positive growth in center-beam car count; these are the cars that carry lumber.  All over the country, we are housing, from roofing tiles to the goods that then what Busch, the Mexicans are

For example, in Houston, the drop was 5.6 percent.  And they have actually Hispanic-intensive areas Mexicans went home.  Mexicans build homes in the United States, all over the country.  But the news is that within the past four to five months, according to my contact, over one-third of the Mexicans have returned.  So my staff is very eager to do field trips to the Busch distributors to do a little more refinement of that data.  The point is, the housing market is robust.

financial, ex utilities companies.  Sales growth in the first quarter of this year was and has been on a down slope.  This is confirmed by my discussions with the CEOs. I like to call it-that is, non-consumer-driven demand, or directly driven contacts is the consumer, the payroll tax-but maybe more influential in the year was the lack of tax refunds and the slowness with which they were paidRegarding overall demand, one sees a slowdown in the top-line growth among the S&amp;P 500 ex 2 percent Enterprise demand, as demand-remains weak.  And the driver of activities reported by my who, despite hiccups reported because of beginning of the continues to spend, presumably by drawing on savings, as employment is not expanding.

And Apple reports that it's a slowdown for the first time ever.  And my direct Chinese contacts report trouble companies, with widespread defaults in the gray financial areas As to the global picture, my contacts continue pointing to France worrisome.  France is 'in the dumper,' to quote one major operator there, and you see it in everything from demand for iPhones and computers to theme park traffic.

Nevertheless, the differences in the two forecasts are not large.  I agree with the analysis in the Tealbook emphasizing positive momentum from stronger equity markets, lower oil prices, and the continuing rebound in housing.  I continue to expect unemployment to tick down this faster than the during the past three growth.

Overall, growth, unemployment, and inflation is very much in line with the Tealbook's. for this meeting, I, too, found it helpful to compare how the outlook has evolved we began the current asset purchase program. asset purchases until the changed.  This outcome reflects offsetting developments that have The federal sequestration was a downside risk at the time but is now provided greater impetus.  This is especially from the low-interest-rate environment.  My contacts say of construction and home purchases.  House price appreciation has MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Recent data have been mixed, but the medium-term economic my forecast for In preparing relative to my projections from September, when For reference, my September forecast was predicated on continuing fourth quarter of 2013 and on funds rate liftoff in the middle of 2015.  Economic growth has progressed more or less in line with my projections from last September, and my outlook for GDP growth hasn't really emerged since last fall. baked in the cake, but private-sector spending has true for housing, which is benefiting everything related to housing is doing well, including windows, furniture, and pickup trucks, reflecting the stepped-up pace also been more brisk than I had expected, and the economy is benefiting broadly from the effects of the appreciation on household balance sheets and the financial conditions of lenders.

rate has come down more quickly than I had Now, despite economic growth being reasonably close to expectations, two developments since last fall stand out.  First, the unemployment expected, although some of that sharper decline reflects falling labor force participation, rather than stronger-than-expected job growth.  Second, the downside risks to the economy have

risks to the economic outlook have emerged, an even-faster rebound in housing and stronger global growth, with aggressive policy Bank of Japan.  Overall, I don't see developments since September as arguing for of asset purchases this year, the same become less predominant.  Indeed, some upside including actions by the significantly more or less monetary stimulus than I had assumed back then.  Accordingly, I still view appropriate policy as including about $750 billion figure as in the new and improved Tealbook assumption.

My own reading of the data is that we goal.  Now, even with In coming to that determination, a key issue is how to gauge where things to our goal of substantial improvement in the outlook for labor markets.  Toward this end, my staff examined various measures of the underlying momentum in the labor market and the economy.  In particular, they indicators are highly correlated with future improvements in labor market either by declines in the the next six months.  The indicators that they found were month changes in private payroll employment growth, initial UI claims, the index, industrial capacity utilization, temporary help employment the share of households that find jobs hard to get rather than plentiful.  Nearly all of these measures of momentum in the labor market are stronger than the historical signaling that the outlook is for an improving labor market.  Moreover, the most of these indicators are stronger than they were back in September, reinforcing the message of an improving outlook for labor market conditions since we started our current asset purchase program.  Of course, this analysis substantial improvement in the outlook for labor are not there yet, but we are clearly making tangible progress toward that

President Evans was asking about this virtuous circle spending growth is that households have already made a lot of progress The debt-to-income ratios are still elevated relative to pre-housinglevels, which suggests there is more deleveraging to come.  Moreover, consumer credit given the current regulatory and economic climate, I relaxation in credit standards ahead.  Certainly, the SLOOS doesn't provide At the national level, I think we have After an have seen several short-lived spurts in economic growth over the last four point, it looks to me as if we're fluctuating around a slow growth trend.  This Tealbook features an acceleration in growth over the next the previous Tealbook.  A key driver of that pickup in growth is the consumer confidence that leads to a significant decline in the personal saving rate and an increase in consumer spending earlier.  Personally, I share President Evans's skepticism.  Clearly, households have been quite cautious ever since the Great Recession, and I expect that caution to continue.  One argument for an increase in consumer reducing their leverage. boom availability is not what it was in the midst of the boom.  One can debate whether the pendulum swung too far in the other direction, but don't see a major any indication that is happening.

I prove it, that one of the main reasons consumers are so cautious now is family or friends during the Great Recession, has caused them to revise the Another argument for an acceleration in consumer spending is that household wealth has increased significantly since the recession.  But for any household spending is also influenced by their suspect, though I cannot that the breadth and severity of income and wealth losses that they experienced personally, or observed among

And without an acceleration in consumer spending, would ever get top-line economic growth of 3Â½ percent.  Thank you probability they place on large future income shocks.  Prior to the recession, the last big downturn was in 1981 and 1982, over 25 years earlier.  It seems plausible that many households came to believe that the Great were likely to be shallow and mild.  The memory those views, is relatively So it is likely, wealth shocks they suffered in the Great Recession is quite plausible.  And this suggests to me that higher personal saving rates are likely to persist for a while, and consumer spending is likely to grow it is hard to see how we very much, Mr. Chairman.

Both Deere and Caterpillar are seeing weaker layoffs.  They are small for now, but, still, this for Caterpillar the last time I construction equipment sales growth has trended negative over the last months.  Earlier this year, they had expected an 8 percent increase this year.  These reports I think this highlights just how small the housing sector is these days.

These cutbacks are mainly at plants that make construction equipment, and that was the same talked to them.  Deere's six are a bit difficult to interpret given the welcome rebound in housing, and many people have mentioned this already. While the growth rates are impressive, the absolute gains are still relatively modest and apparently not enough to require significant additions to the stock of building equipment.

Given I have made to my outlook, I won't spend time reviewing my outlook. I'm hearing for economic growth, my interpretation of recent progress in labor markets, and MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I forecast since our last meeting.  I reduction in unemployment, and a the small revisions Instead, I will focus my comments on three topics:  the anecdotal support continued moderate my interpretation of the low readings on PCE inflation.

District contacts continue to see moderate growth District contacts have indicated that they see continuing growth in their District reports was the housing sector-despite the District we still have a substantial backlog of foreclosures and we have seen only District, we are seeing some progress.  The company that supplies paints that is headquartered in my District country that are still working through foreclosure year.

While my contacts from the export-focused businesses offered some notes of caution, most of my activity level.  And a clear bright spot in my fact that in my moderate appreciation in home prices.  Even in my CEO of an international reported robust demand for paint for both new home construction and remodeling.  Interestingly, demand for paint is strong even in areas of the gluts, like my District.  He also noted that paint contractors' purchases of capital equipment, which is a forward-looking indicator, are also up sharply this projecting both new home construction and remodeling to remain robust for some time.  And this domestic strength may be an important offset to weak international growth.

activity certainly wasn't encouraging, I am not inclined to view it as discouraging either. payroll gains in the month of March, the three-month moving average, a Let me turn from my anecdotal reports to labor markets.  While the March report on labor market Despite the weakness in

April 30-May 1, 2013

at a respectable 168,000 jobs per month.  Relative growth, this pace of job gains represents solid progress in the labor continue to drive the trend growth lower.  To see the implications of these years, the actual circumstances, a slow rate of job growth, as low as we have observed in the month a reflection of the recession versus a reflection of gains along the lines of the last three a cyclical much less noisy indicator of progress, stands to the likely trend rate of market.  As the Tealbook has noted, powerful demographic forces rates of labor force participation and labor force declining trends, consider an extreme scenario in which, over the next couple of participation rate declines in lockstep with a trend estimate like the one shown in the Tealbook. Under these of March, would still be enough to gradually lower the unemployment rate.  Of course, much of the currently low participation rate is likely demographic trends.  But, arithmetically, the fact that the trend is continuing to decline means that the pace of job gains needed to lower unemployment is much lower today than it would have been 10 years ago.  In that case, continued employment months should perhaps be considered as substantial, again, unless we start to see bounceback in the participation rate.

will now turn to my third topic-the low readings on PCE inflation.  While PCE 2 percent long-run objective and dipped yet This suggests to me year-over-year basis, the recent declines in and PCE rates is largely due to the larger weight of shelter costs in the I inflation has been consistently running below our lower in March, the CPI-based measures have remained relatively stable. that PCE inflation is unlikely to fall further.  On a PCE inflation and the stability of various measures of CPI inflation, including the median CPI, indicate that the divergence between CPI and PCE inflation rates has increased.  The current differential between CPI CPI.  I would be more concerned about disinflation if the cost of shelter, the single-largest component of the consumer's out-of-pocket funding, was decelerating and pulling down both the

April 30-May 1, 2013

estimates of inflation expectations remain low, they have also been CPI and the PCE inflation.  Another reason I put considerable weight on CPI measures in judging price trends is that households and businesses are more focused on CPI inflation than the PCE measure, so the CPI should be more influential in the formation of inflation expectations. While the Cleveland Fed stable in the face of PCE disinflation.

continue to view the risks as tilted to the growth and tilted to the upside for unemployment.  This is due primarily to we are facing as a country and the potential for some slowing in in China.  In contrast, I see the risks to the inflation outlook balanced.  The downside risks stem from the potential for a faltering recovery to pull Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As to the balance of risks around my outlook, I downside for GDP the ongoing fiscal challenges economic growth abroad, especially as broadly inflation lower, while the upside risks follow from the ongoing public worries about our large balance sheet that could trigger a rise in inflation expectations.

In addition, the spring years were accompanied by notable external shocks and risks, such as the Signs of improvement in labor markets continue, despite a weaker March, and the underlying conditions in the labor as we have seen in the past.

This risk is obviously choose to taper without clear evidence of a substantial improvement in the I'll leave my script to say this-I think we have to be I meant 'this.'  And what I meant.'  I think that does not sound like way to mitigate this policy step that is clearly designed to ease program as signaling that the Committee was highly likely to take additional tightening steps in immediately subsequent meetings.  Here, these contacts are reasoning by Committee actions.

And here-and careful not to be defining 'substantial' so as to sort of fit the conditions we want.  Credibility means that the word you use means what people think it means.  And I think it is very challenging for us to go back ex post and say, 'Well, really, by 'substantial,' you might not have thought that, but that's really the communication of a credible individual or agency, at least to me.  One risk of people worrying about a rapid decrease in the level of accommodation following any tapering is to pair tapering with another offsetting financial conditions.

This outlook is similar to the Tealbook's and, I you around the table-at least it was in March, and it doesn't you go back to our January principles statement, it explicitly that the Committee seeks to mitigate these kinds of deviations from our goals. fulfill this policy commitment that we made in our January principles statement by accommodation. remain elevated for think, to the outlook of many of sound like that has changed that much.  It implies that we are falling short relative to both our inflation and employment objectives.  Now, if says We can only providing more there are risks to that modal outlook.  In And it is possible that reducing this possibility justify tightening monetary At our last meeting, I sketched out how we might think about answering this distributed a memo that provides more details of my proposed I'm hoping is that this memo will help to foster a productive policy and monetary policy.  In my view, I about the ability of monetary policy I have just suggested, and as my memo suggested, I do when I think that it is hard to In reaching this conclusion that we need to provide more accommodation, I focused exclusively on my modal outlook.  And of course particular, we have seen in 2008 and 2009 how a sharp deterioration in financial conditions has the potential to lead employment and prices to fall rapidly. accommodation would reduce that kind of tail risk by constricting the degree of frothiness in financial markets.  So that raises the question, can policy at this time? question, and last week I approach.  What conversation about the intersection of financial stability think we need to be talking explicitly, both internally and, eventually, externally, about the magnitude of tail risks that we see due to possible financial instability.  And we need to be talking explicitly both internally and, eventually, externally, to ameliorate those tail risks.  As anticipate that these tail risks will be an important part of our policy deliberations, but only the economy has improved more.  As my memo indicated, right now

April 30-May 1, 2013

argue in favor of tightening for financial stability reasons, given how far we are from our dual mandate objectives.  There is simply insufficient tail risk to employment and prices to outweigh the more basic need for additional accommodation implied by the modal outlook.

as long as inflation remains under control.  I will say again that But, of course, communication is about what you hear, you say.  And I think what people heard was we were communicating our can to support the economic recovery, as long as inflation control.  In January, we reaffirmed our commitment to 2 percent target inflation.  I would say that we can best support the adding accommodation, not years, we do have many tools at our disposal.  We can generate a large amount of stimulus desire to do so, reduce about this point in the next go-round.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, last September we communicated our commitment to do whatever we can to support the economic recovery I think we felt there were sentences-I'll call them almost footnotes-that reduced that 'whatever we can' feel to our statement. not just what commitment to do whatever we remains under think my own outlook is such that tightening at this time or in the near term will erode the credibility of both of these commitments.

My view is that uncertainty about the near-term outlook is quite high.  We fundamentals-the household balance sheet, housing, U.S. energy competitiveness, a high level of corporate profits, and the amount of

In January and February, the improvement in the fundamentals appeared to be a very cold month weather-wise, also be distorting the outlook.

The softer I wouldn't put much weight on that single It's the confluence of a wider array of weaker indicators that have fiscal restraint. winning out, in March the fiscal restraint.  But March was seasonally adjusted, and that may hold with great confidence, is that the contractionary fiscal impulse will dominate over the near term. payroll gain in March might be part of that picture, but payroll number by itself. gotten my attention.

agree with the Tealbook that economic growth will be slower in the second quarter, but I'm a bit more pessimistic than the Tealbook year.  The Tealbook is at about 2Â¾ percent growth, and I'm in the I'm a bit weaker than the Tealbook are pretty relative to the underlying you are very generous, you might put the underlying trend in percent.  I think you have to really work to get to that. I like to look account balance just doesn't seem likely to move close to neutral.  The year, which restrains growth.  That means I I actually differ a little bit after that.  For example, for the second half of the range of 2Â¼ to 2Â½ percent.  The reasons why straightforward.  First, I think the amount of fiscal drag is large momentum of the economy.  If economic growth at a little bit north of 2 Second, when we think about the factors that could cause an impulse to growth to offset the fiscal drag, it seems it is hard to tell, at least in my mind, a very compelling story. at the accounting identity to think about impulses to growth.  The public savings balance plus the private savings balance equals the current account balance.  And just look at what is going to happen to those three indicators.  The current much.  U.S. competitiveness is rising with the decline in relative energy costs, but the growth outlook abroad has weakened, so the trade sector looks like it is pretty public balance is moving to a much smaller deficit this

I'm worried about. we need an offsetting shift in the desired saving balance of the private sector to offset the shift in the public balance.  If this doesn't happen, of will happen by the economy being weaker, with the budget deficit shrinking by less as weakness constrains because imports will weaken.  Balance would be And I think the risks are that this is what is likely to happen.  Economic growth will disappoint because, ex ante, the narrowing in the fiscal balance will be larger than the desired ex ante drop in private balances.  That's what

I expect that the improving fundamentals will ultimately reassert comfort from the improvement in financial market conditions and the year, when the negative impulse from fiscal policy starts to lessen.  And it I really can be more confident about the outlook so that I could actually as credible to turn down the dial in terms of the rate of asset purchases without that Longer term, themselves.  I take some fact that the housing sector should continue its recovery.  But, to me, this doesn't seem likely to happen until later this won't be until then that see it threatening what we have promised.

the fact that inflation is coming in a little bit lower agree with the staff that some of this is likely just noise; nonmarket over time.  We I'm not particularly On inflation, I don't make too much of than expected.  I think I measures, for example, have been very, very low.  Also, with inflation expectations still well anchored, I think this is a force that will pull inflation back toward 2 percent certainly don't have much near-term risk on inflation to the upside, but worried that the underlying inflation trend will fall much further.

taking Cyprus as a one-off, and the ECB's OMT still In terms of the risk to the outlook, I continue to be worried about Europe.  The good news is that the markets are generally

April 30-May 1, 2013

there is still plenty of offsetting bad news.  Since the last meeting-this is very consistent I talked with people in private equity and France.  And that's important because France has had pretty much a free pass from the a consensus develops that further austerity can be dialed back a bit, but are really going to support that.  Most significantly to me, elevated despite the low ECB refinancing rate. wouldn't do much except signal the ECB's concerns.  After all, as Simon pointed out, euro overnight index average, rate is less than 10 basis points right now.  So to really going to pass through in terms of to any significant degree. miraculously, at least to me, seems to be effective in capping borrowing costs in the periphery. But with what, I think, Richard Fisher talked about-when industrial companies, they are seeing a lot more weakness in Europe, and, in particular, with respect to markets up to this point.  Also, as we see in Italy, political support for further austerity is slipping.  That's okay if it's not obvious that the core countries the transmission channels of monetary policy in Europe are not working well, with the borrowing costs in the peripheral countries very And that is not an easy problem to fix.  Even if the ECB were to cut the refinancing rate this week, it the EONIA, the cut the refinancing rate from 75 basis points is not borrowing costs pan-European banking union.  That is clean and replenish their capital.  The national going to resist that.  They are not going to want to identify capital holes.  After all, a very inefficient recapitalization, dollar for What is needed for Europe is really hard; that is a difficult, and it's going to take quite a bit of time.  Some of the problems include the tension that is going to exist between the incentives of the ECB and the national supervisory authorities.  The ECB is going to want to scrub the banks authorities are that would reflect very badly on their own regulatory oversight.  Second, even if the ECB wins out, it is not clear where the capital will come from.  The ESM is actually mechanism for directly recapitalizing banks because direct bank

But if the recapitalization the government indebtedness of the sovereign and just reinforces the linkage between the sovereigns and the banks, which we are trying to cut.  Third, even if the ECB scrubs the banks clean and gets them recapitalized, that is not sufficient.  You still need a pan-European resolution regime and a pan-European deposit insurance system to make a euro a euro throughout the euro zone.  And that is very to implement.

a lot of discussion around the few quick thoughts.  I think we have made gains have been strong relative to the underlying economic growth trend.  And before, we have ultimately been disappointed in terms of the pace of improvement in underlying labor market conditions.  When I seeing further improvement.  Given that I am pretty uncertain big questions about why we are seeing such relative to everything else, we haven't yet, in my mind, Finally, in terms of the labor market-because we have had table about the labor market, I just jotted down a some progress, but, to me, it is difficult to assess how much progress in two important respects. First, the payroll when we have seen that sustainability of the payroll employment trend.  And, second, the drop in the unemployment rate seems to exaggerate the think about the labor market outlook the key to what constitutes substantial improvement in the labor market outlook is really not just how much the labor market has improved, but the confidence level that we attach to about the near-term outlook, and that I have some large declines in the unemployment rate gotten over the threshold of substantial improvement in the labor market outlook in terms of my confidence level.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Yellen.

the news that has rolled in since our as mostly on the soft side.  I am concerned that weak readings on production, market may stall.  But it is premature to rush to judgment, and I am MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I see March meeting spending, and payroll employment portend a fourth consecutive spring swoon, and I am worried that progress in the labor determined to watch and wait with an open mind.

the asset market purchases is to achieve a substantial improvement in the outlook. In my remarks today, I will focus on developments in the labor market, because objective of our employment report as dismal.  The percentage point decline in the labor force participation rate the one-tenth of a percentage point decline in the unemployment rate. concluded that labor underutilization had likely increased, notwithstanding the decline in Because the division in the household survey of those without work categories of unemployed and out of the labor market is somewhat arbitrary, the to undertake further engage in nonmarket activities.  This interpretation attributes much, if not all, of the An alternative rate reflected genuine diminution in labor Many market participants read the March establishment survey suggested widespread weakness in payroll employment growth, and analysts noted that the two-tenths more than accounted for They the unemployment rate. between the decline in unemployment could mainly reflect shifts between these categories as would occur if those out of work searched less intensively or abandoned job search entirely schooling or decline in labor force participation to cyclical, not structural, factors, so that between the decline in unemployment and that in participation, on net, resource slack increased. possibility is that the decline in the unemployment market slack.  In this interpretation, the decline in labor force participation would reflect

April 30-May 1, 2013

an ongoing decline in the labor force structural factors that have been responsible for participation trend.

as last month's employment report is concerned, I find the evidence more the Tealbook notes-and Bill mentioned this-the time for whopping Â½ percentage point.  Although each of these part recession, both over time U.S. states.  The sizable step-down in part-time employment, coupled attached workers in March, As far consistent with the second interpretation.  As number of marginally attached, discouraged workers, and individuals working part economic reasons declined in tandem with the unemployment rate, and U6, a measure including all of these additional categories, fell by a additional measures is noisy, the decline in the fraction of the workforce that is working time for economic reasons was sizable.  This particular measure of slack has been highly correlated with the aggregate unemployment rate since the onset of the and in a cross section of with the decline in the numbers of discouraged and marginally suggests to me that despite weak payroll employment growth, there may actually have been some further improvement in the labor market.

general point-namely, that to assess the overall extent of labor market any deviation of labor force participation from its trend.  Stated of employment from its maximum level, which monetary policies should weighted sum of two gaps:  the unemployment gap and the labor force estimation of the trend participation rate is fraught with uncertainty, and Board staff have made important These alternative possible interpretations of last month's employment report highlight an important and more slack, we need to factor in estimates of both the deviation between actual unemployment and the natural rate, as well as differently, the shortfall seek to minimize, is the participation gap.  Unfortunately, like so many of the unobserved trends that are critical for the assessment of slack, debates are now raging in the literature over its magnitude.

The Tealbook judges that the reflects a combination of amounting to about 0.7 percentage point.  Importantly, this participation gap is the largest estimated cyclical shortfall since the 1960s, exceeding the estimated shortfall in the deep recession of 1981-82 and during the jobless recovery following the 2001 recession.  The consequence is that the overall degree of labor market slack-by an involved.  Using the Tealbook's assumption that the natural rate now percent, the unemployment gap amounts to 1.6 percent of the labor force, or about shortfall of actual from trend labor force 1.7 million jobs.  So the overall shortfall of at about Like President Pianalto, I, too, performed a simple calculation.  My objective was to illustrate the magnitudes stands at 6 2Â½ million jobs.  And the 0.7 percentage point participation translates into an additional roughly employment from its maximum sustainable level, the employment gap, currently stands 4.2 million, or 1.7 percent of the population.  By this dual mandate metric, we are falling very short of meeting our maximum employment mandate.

sensitive to the assumed labor force the as gap substantially larger than my 4.2 million estimate. My back-of-the-envelope calculation is obviously participation trend.  However, in comparison with other recent studies, the staff's estimate of trend labor force participation rate is decidedly on the low end.  Two very recent studies, in contrast, estimate that the cyclical shortfall in labor force participation is more than twice large, which translates into an employment Of course, if the actual pace of trend decline in labor force participation is much smaller than the

Tealbook assumes, this might also call into question the plausibility of my more optimistic interpretation of last month's employment report.

or, of labor market slack should lead prudent policymakers to deemphasize resource slack in setting monetary policy.  They should instead respond good old assumed that an incorrect estimate of the natural rate are symmetric around the true from policy errors reflecting an overly optimistic natural-rate estimate.  This Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests the long-run flat and not vertical at low inflation rates, likely reflecting downward and well-anchored inflation expectations.  With a vertical Phillips curve, a policymaker, albeit perhaps with a lag, to the presence of a large response to declining inflation could be sufficient to stabilize In contrast, a failure to take into account the level of the gap produces poor results when the Phillips curve is flat.  In this case, movements in relatively little insight into the size of the employment gap. Confronted with such uncertainty, how should policymakers respond?  Research by John Williams, Athanasios Orphanides, and others suggests that uncertainty about the natural rate more generally, the level estimates of the level of to inflation and changes in output gaps.  These studies were penned, however, in the days, when the short-term rates were unconstrained by the zero lower bound.  They the welfare costs due to natural rate.  With policy constrained by the zero lower bound, however, the costs from inadvertently reducing accommodation due to an overestimate of the natural rate greatly outweigh those suggests that we should be more concerned about the possibility that slack is wider than we currently estimate than that it is lower. Phillips curve is extremely nominal wage rigidity declining inflation alerts employment gap.  So a strong employment near its maximum level. resource inflation provide clear evidence that the employment gap is think it is a mistake What conclusions do I draw?  First, I see currently far wider than the unemployment gap on its own suggests.  And I

Distress sales were down to 21 percent of prices continued to climb, and average time on market continued to go down.  I have been reading about some of the earnings dramatically from lack of demand to supply-chain problems.

glad that we do have two more payroll reports attention to both the initial readings and the I took a look at revisions to employment fence about what to do last year at the September August payroll figure, at 96,000 net jobs, seemed to Notwithstanding the disappointing jobs number in March, it still looks to me like the private sector is finally on firm footing.  So I'm before our June meeting, and we'll be paying revisions to prior months.  Like President George, reports in the past.  I remember being on the meeting, until the Chairman argued that the demand action.  But after the October payroll report revised August jobs up to 192,000, and the July number up from 141,000 to 181,000, the current estimates for those months are now

April 30-May 1, 2013

and 165,000 for August.  So I still wonder whether our actions might have been of single-month numbers.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 153,000 for July any different if the initial report and the subsequent revision had gone in the opposite direction, and I have definitely learned to be wary

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.

I wasn't going to say was actually going to go to some of the issues that Charlie you have commented on labor markets, I thought would say a couple of things. MR. TARULLO.  Thank explicitly or implicitly, the data since the March lot of us anticipated during our last meeting, namely, whether the burst of numbers in the preceding months was going to be anything about labor markets.  I Evans has already raised, but because many of I

I talk to the Board labor I've been talking to a bunch of non-Board labor economists, and come through despite the variations in their views.  First, they readily confess to not crisis and recession, that is, cyclical and structural factors than we intuition that what we're going through right an effect on structural trends, but they find it difficult to specify exactly what.  But years, we A markets.  And it's pretty I've been talking with a economists all the time, but three things really understanding what was going on in labor markets before the the decline in dynamism of U.S. labor markets over the preceding 10 to 15 years.  Second, they all have the intuition that there is less distinction between might otherwise have thought.  And they have the now is having third, they all seem to think that no matter how that debate turns out over the coming are nowhere near, at this point, whatever full employment would look like, particularly when you

April 30-May 1, 2013

you know, it may be that good bit of structural damage, but that's not showing up now.  It's not going to while.'  So talking to me as a monetary policymaker, they say 'don't worry about other things to worry about-and maybe next year or the year afterI think we're all going to have to dive down to those murky depths over the guess is that it is going to be hard to come to a highly are huge amounts of slack.  And so we're going to have to move take into account the kind of analysis Janet just did of effective underutilization as opposed to just nominally stated underutilization.  They will say things like, 'Well, there's been a show up for a that now.  There may be but not right now.' next couple of decision points, but my precise sense of how much is cyclical, how much is structural, and whether there amounts of slack or just moderately huge some on intuition.

I did want to note is that, as Charlie observed earlier, even may have been the most eye catching, maybe the more significant trend years now crisis and recession, but capital expenditures now seem to be leveling off as approaching their historical averages.  And I thought it was interesting financial firms last week noted that a lot of large see enough is, they've caught up with the spending that recession that they needed for replacement or other purposes, but now One of the other two things though the jobs number over the last couple of months is in business investment.  We've had a couple of where businesses seem to have been compensating for the collapse of investment during the worst stages of the they return to something that one of the newsletters put out by one of the businesses are saying that they're essentially done with investment until they additional demand to justify more spending.  That they didn't do during the they're done until there's a reason to undertake something new.

and confidence how weak income growth has been.  I don't On the other hand, housing remains pretty strong.  Consumer spending have held up, really, remarkably well considering

April 30-May 1, 2013

saving rate is now down to 2.7 percent, and in years or so, the only time it spent any appreciable time below 3 percent was the It's not clear that that's sustainable, but it has been good news to this point.  So I know how much longer it can go on.  I mean, the the last 25 middle of the last decade, when everybody thought they would get rich by their houses appreciating. think we're just, now, going to sit and see the degree to which March is an anomaly or a portent of the kind of setback that has occurred, now, three previous times during the recovery.

may prove hard in the near term to disentangle the factors that year.  You could ask whether the recent burst of stronger activity was principally the result of a whether it momentum that has built up as deleveraging has proceeded fairly far and abated.  But even if the underlying momentum idea proves valid, adopted at the beginning of the year, is, in any brake pedal, just as things were starting to get greatest effects of the good indication that the get poorer numbers, it's going to be I think, to determine whether the momentum story is still the right one and just going to forth, or whether there still is an underlying absence of momentum.  So able to look through the masking basic strength in the economy. Looking ahead, I think it are going to affect the pace of recovery for the better part of the rest of this reasonably snapback from Hurricane Sandy and the drought and some other temporary factors, or reflected an underlying other residual headwinds have the sequestration, on top of the fiscal measures case, going to be pushing down pretty hard on the going.  For me, this means that the information over the next several months is likely to be inconclusive.  Now, if we get reasonably strong numbers in the face of the sequestration in the second and third quarters, that would be a pretty underlying momentum story has some force to it.  But if we hard, take a little time to show we may not be able to make a judgment for a while, until we're maximum effects of the sequestration to see if it's

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Raskin.

many of you, I have been disappointed data.  The trajectories of capital spending, homebuilding, industrial would be this spring. I'm not yet convinced that these data signal bad times ahead, I do think this collection of we are about to be pleasantly surprised by a I find it hard to believe the U.S. economy has MS. RASKIN.

In particular, the forward momentum to grow rapidly anytime soon in the face of the significant fiscal drag developing.

years of sluggish and discouraging recovery, I once again asking whether this is it.  Have we settled into some 'new normal' pace of activity, with permanently slower economic growth?  I think there are very good reasons years.  Some of these also have been a declining trend in labor force slowed as middleare less productive. economy, at the moment, are probably not as significant as the cyclical weakness in the labor market.  In unemployment rate remains too high mainly because there just aren't that both consumers and small businesses view jobs as still hard to get. As we close in on almost four find myself one associated to believe that increases in potential output have slowed over the past five are fairly uncontroversial, like the aging of the population.  But there may deceleration in relevant educational attainment and a more rapidly participation.  I think it's also possible that structural productivity may have income workers are displaced and take up low-income jobs, where they However, as important as these trends are to the long-run health of the I still think they my view, the level of the enough jobs.  Job vacancies remain fairly low, both overall and across a variety of industries, and survey measures suggest

So a couple of weeks ago, a job fair at a community college in my neighborhood, and I decided to swing by for found is that the fell into the following categories:  three child-care firms; the military; one community bank; local government; a disposal company; enough, swimming pools-many, many swimming pool companies.

Well, back in the day, weren't lifeguards the jobs we had as summer jobs?  And I was curious because, back then, being a lifeguard most certainly

So I stopped managers; and the ever-evasive, but more-enticing, interns.

I immediately zeroed in on two categories described in the brochure:  jobs, and perks and benefits.

It even work jobs where their skills aren't fully used or where they they would prefer to work full time.

As Bill Wascher and others have and gasoline prices have measures.

If inflation expectations changed at all, they've drifted down.  And, of course, My best guess is that the disinflation we are witnessing over year will prove transitory, but it certainly appears to me that the risks have percent inflation flip side, the risk that inflation is about to move PCE prices process-core intermediate materials prices-were close to zero over the 12 months through March. early this wage increases have been anemic. the first half of this shifted somewhat and that the possibility of falling even further below our 2 target has increased lately.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. lifeguard, but So let's see.  In terms of the outlook for the remainder of this that we'll keep grinding forward, making progress hand, we have the ongoing drag from the sequestration the payroll and other tax increases increases in asset values-in house prices and stock prices-and whatever effects those might bring.  Also, it's worth reminding ourselves that, thanks, in part, to our policies, credit conditions are very accommodative.  I think that the 15-year mortgage all-time low.  We continue to see record lending the SLOOS this time around: the spreads

April 30-May 1, 2013

of the last several weeks remind us.  And, in fact, it seems to be quite going to go through something of a soft patch over the next few months, with Certainly, I don't see any reason to expect that going to rip off a streak of six months of 200,000-plus payroll job gains anytime soon, and be in this mode of two steps up, one step back, and just kind of a drift. a little bit earlier-to do a little bit of longer-term stocktaking and ask where got started with this program.  Again, the unemployment percent, and the Tealbook was forecasting 8.0 percent unemployment at the end ahead of schedule percent now, 18 months or so earlier than the Tealbook had forecast. 0.6 percentage point, and the revision to the 0.7 percentage point.  I tried to look at the confidence band-I'm sure I percentile of what the forecast in news on the summary statistic satisfied with where we are or that the had thus far meets the elusive test of substantial improvement, but it's Now, of course, that doesn't mean it's not going to be choppy from month to month as the various data releases likely that we're little momentum in one direction or another. we're it feels like we may really With that lack of local momentum in mind, it is useful-I am just going to reiterate what John Williams said we've come since September, when we rate then was 8.1 of 2013 and 7.6 percent at the end of 2014.  So, in one sense, we're kind of because we're at 7.6 Another way to put this is in terms of the revisions to the unemployment rate forecasts, where I think the revision to the 2013 year-end number is 2014 year-end number is got it wrong-it's sort of like we are now at about the 80th September would have had us, something like that, plus or minus.  So the unemployment front, at least, has been sort of one standard deviation to the upside.  Again, with all due respect to the fact that the unemployment rate is, by itself, not a perfect and, of course, not to say either that we should be improvement that we've clear, I think, that at least on the labor market, we're headed in the right direction.  And as others have also pointed out, I think there's some sense, at least, a little bit informal, that not only are

April 30-May 1, 2013

we headed in the right direction in terms of the mean, but the downside risk in the forecast has been tempered somewhat.

I wanted to do is juxtapose those revisions in the labor market outlook with the estimate about the scale of our asset purchase program.  If you look at in October 2012, shortly after we had gotten started, the median $1.24 trillion.  And it has been kind of bouncing around in a narrow range:  It was about gone up to almost $1.373 trillion-roughly a 10 percent increase since comments on this because I think it points to a fundamental challenge that we've been an open-ended program.  Obviously, we've had disagreements about costs even had disagreements about what we thought we were signing Let's I was that it was meant to be good news came in, we thought the market would sort of scale are pretty notion because I good news relative to expectations-again, they were Now what revisions in the market's the primary dealer survey dealer's expectation for cumulative purchases, MBS and Treasuries, over the life of the program was $1.27 trillion in March, and then, most recently, after the disappointing round of numbers in the last couple weeks, it has October in the market's expectation of our asset purchases.  I want to underscore this and really focus my having in managing and benefits, all of that; we've on for in September.  You know, some of us were surprised by the initial market response. set all of that aside.  It seems like the one shared premise we had going in and, indeed, what took to be one of the central benefits of going open-ended self-adjusting.  That is to say, as down its expectations for the program, and, conversely, if bad news came in, the market would scale up its expectations.  And here, I think we have to admit to ourselves the data clear in rejecting this premise.  The data are just at odds with the self-calibrating think that we have had unequivocally modest expectations-about the labor market outlook, yet the expected size of the program has

April 30-May 1, 2013

I think that if the automatic stabilizer was in play, it could have grown a little bit.  Whereas shrunk fairly appreciably.

I think that it turns out we've got a real communications problem, that we started out by saying that we're looking for substantial improvement, but we appropriate; I think it would have been wrong to try is that because we're not telling the market what it can make inferences is from our actions.  And, as the good news has not spectacular fashion-we've been reluctant even with a sort of token-really, you know, not economically meaningful, because, exactly as Narayana was saying, any change is that's the right thing to do, taking as reasonable inference that the that our bar hasn't really moved.  So in fact, the bar kind of ratchets up, and difficult to adjust the flow rate. So what's going on? which is didn't provide specificity.  I think that was to put a number on it.  But a corollary of that the target is, the only way accumulated-and, again, it has accumulated in a to acknowledge it but token-adjustment in the flow rate going to be freighted with signal weight, and we don't want to disappoint the market or do something that's credibility damaging.  You know, exogenous market expectations.  Of course, as a result, the only market can draw is the next time around, we're finding it even more basically caught in an expectational trap here.  I think there's a very direct analyst estimates for their earnings and are a penny.  Obviously, a penny is nothing of any substance, analysts know that you're doing everything you can to not miss by a penny you miss by a penny, you're kind of a loser.  So you'd really better not miss by a penny. good equilibrium to be in because it's an equilibrium, in you're smoothing.  Again, I think we're analogy between where we are and firms that have afraid to miss the analyst estimate by but, of course, if the and if In this kind of equilibrium, even these very small things that are not economically significant take on a lot of signal value.  It's not a some sense, where information doesn't get communicated because

April 30-May 1, 2013

this is completely apart from any statement about costs and benefits of asset purchases or the economy.  It's just a statement about an unfortunate kind of communications position that I think we are in.

excessive recent news.  That is to say, again, we've had cumulative progress, yet we hit a patch March ratchets up to its highest level that Is the market kind of crazy to put so much inferential weight on numbers that Well, no, not if we validate it.  In other words, if going to then react and say, 'Oh, the market has moved its number up.  We're going to doing something,' well, then the market is completely rational to going to validate that, it's Moreover, I think the problem in our case seems to be compounded by the salience of of weak numbers, and the market expectation for we've seen so far. don't have that much information content? we're send a really bad signal by move its number up.  It's sort of a coordinating device in the limit.  You can have a number that's near uninformative, but if everybody thinks that we're completely rational.

about long-run merits, on long-run costs and benefits, but I think we should all agree that we Betsy was alluding to before-that if we get one bad going to do going forward.  So I think it's an important imperative for us to just reassert our what the right thing to do is and less by, geez, it's Thursday night and gods of measurement error that you don't get a bad draw on the next I just look at the dynamic we're in, and again, apart from anything I have this discomfort that we're losing control, a little bit, of the decisionmaking process.  And I think we could disagree want the ultimate scale of the program to be driven by something having to do with fundamentals.  I just worry-sort of what print before June, even if it's a number that's ultimately revised, it will dictate a little bit what we're control of the pace and the long-run scale of the program so that it's driven more by collective assessment of you have to pray to the

KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, I do have a question for Governor Stein; think through his remarks, which were of what substantial improvement in labor market outlook meant, which might have been very challenging, would it have eliminated that equilibrium what think it would have.

It may not go on in exactly the you'd like it to, but that is definitely going on.  Whereas, if we had set a fixed date last would have set it for the summer, July 1, and we'd be sitting here end the program on July 1 or not.  That's the situation we were I think that this automatic adjustment definitely is going on, and we MR. BULLARD.  Yes, I interpretation of this open-ended program.

I see the data since the last meeting as mixed and modestly disappointing, on balance, but not so bad as to require adjustment to the outlook.  Echoing several others contacts reported that their antennas are up now to the possibility of and that's in contrast with a more positive sentiment for the March meeting.

economy has oscillated through periods of strength and weakness about another spring I lean toward a modestly more positive narrative.  One could look at growth rate.  So if one were to take the Tealbook forecast for the rest of 2013 but back the fiscal drag from the tax increases and the full and 3.4 percent for the year.  Now, I hasten to add that in my old life of buying and selling companies in the private contact sport.  So I hereby add a conceptual grain of salt if actual economic growth broadly tracks the Tealbook and the central tendency for Since early 2010, the around a 2 percent growth rate.  At the moment, there is plenty of chatter swoon.  Perhaps a lack of confidence by cautious households and businesses somehow reinforces and perpetuates that cycle. the U.S. economy as an investor might:  strip out the unusual events, the one-timers, to reveal the underlying back out the arguable one-timers-that would mean subtracting the snapback from the drought and the hurricane, but also adding sequestration-economic growth would be 3.2 percent in the first half full market, one-timering was very much a to that.  Still,

a real reason for confidence in the strength of the Of course, the bigger picture is that we don't know which narrative will emerge.  It's the Committee's forecast, I think that provides recovery. our responsibility to have a policy that addresses the range of plausible outcomes, or most of that range, and it seems to me that while we've had some progress, there's still work to do on that front.

I apologize if this is repetitive, both of my earlier remarks and of some this is by comparison with the thresholds the the liftoff date.  If conditions worsen, the market moves The Committee still holds the reins but puts the market in a position to In comparison, it is also troubling to me to retrace the path of the current LSAP, and I It's true that the local response to the March employment print was had a significant improvement-I won't try to market and in the outlook for the labor market I won't repeat all of the numbers that Jeremy did, but I will add that at the time average number In Since the Committee adopted the open-ended purchase program in September, the middle cases have concerned me.

But the bigger picture is that we've use the freighted word 'substantial'-in the labor since September. of the September meeting, the Committee was looking at a trailing six-month average increase in nonfarm payrolls of 97,000 per month.  That would be revised up subsequently, but the Committee didn't know that in September.  The six-month trailing payroll through March 2013 is 188,000-almost a doubling.  The other statistics have already been used,

It's as if the market has gotten the sign we've had a significant improvement, if not a substantial one, but the don't blame the market.  It seems to me that we need to continue to the program.  I thought that the Chairman's good start on this.  The easily absorb the conversation of a potential reduction in the pace of briefly topped the yield of 2 percent.

Thank you for a very interesting discussion.  I'll try to dissonance today than usual.  I've been listening very, very there's a little bit of a bimodal view.  So some of my sentences will have in them.

economic growth with slowly improving more resilient private-sector demand, including housing, is being offset, the economic growth outlook still appear to be to Is this a new normal?  Inflation remains below target.  Those risks, most of those who commented, appear broadly balanced. The most recent data have been mixed, raising some concern about the spring swoons. Overall, however, the outlook remains for moderate conditions.  Somewhat to some degree, by fiscal restraint.

a good bit of transgressing on tomorrow's discussion, but will forgive that because I know everybody is very concerned about those issues.  Are there any That's a somewhat disjointed review of the discussion I heard, but, again, I thought it was a very rich discussion.  And there was I comments or questions on my summary?  [No response]

few additional comments.  As many have noted, the data since report, in particular.  But I put half of the group here in terms of optimism.  I still see economic year.  And one very useful observation, I think, If not, let me just make a the last meeting have been somewhat mixed-the March labor myself maybe in the top fundamentals as having improved since late last is that private domestic final demand, that is, C plus I , has been growing pretty rapidly over the

April 30-May 1, 2013

some private-sector momentum as we go into fiscal restraint.  I heard some of this at the G-20 and IMF meetings that, as here in Washington recently.  While there was a lot of morose also a lot of discussion of the so-called three-speed global recovery. past six months or so, which suggests that there is a period of some Steve Kamin mentioned, were discussion, there was There's now a third speed, the United States, which is perceived by our international partners as picking up and moving faster than other industrial countries.  So there is some sense that fundamentals are improving here in the United States.

I talked about last time, I think financial conditions are easier.  That's shown by many indexes from the Chicago Fed and other Federal credit conditions in the obvious in interestI think the explanation for consumption seems stronger than income would justify is that wealth, easier financial As indicators, including financial conditions Reserve Banks.  This reflects, obviously, U.S. monetary policy, but also financial developments in Europe, where spreads have come down, and in Japan, as well as better banking sector.  The benefits of these easier financial conditions are most and credit-sensitive sectors like consumer durables and housing, but why conditions, lower interest rates, and so on are supporting consumers and allowing them to save less out of their current disposable income.

claim that our policy is having no effect on the economy has to effects on the broader system.  I'd make a couple of a temporary will increase, and sellers will see more attractive opportunities to put I must say that any contend with what's happening in the housing market.  There's a lot happening in the housing market, and I think that it's having important comments about developments there.  One is the observation that current sales are being held back by lack of supply, which is an interesting development.  I think this is probably situation.  Construction their houses on the market.  On the other hand, it's good news that we're having fewer

April 30-May 1, 2013

concern has been raised about the anecdotal reports of increases in asked the staff to are not moving much.  The official data show a 1.5 percent gain in are down.  And cost indexes for housing construction only show about a gain in 2012.  Those indexes don't reflect some of the latest data, but they do show a gain.  So while there are increased construction costs, they don't seem, at this foreclosures coming into the housing market.  That's a good reason for supply to be declining.  A second observation is that construction costs.  I was interested in this because if that were an important factor, that would obviously be something that would slow the gains in the housing market.  So I look at this, and we talked about it.  As best we can tell, this doesn't seem to be a big problem at this point.  For example, the prices of developed lots have been rising, and the number of developed lots is low in absolute terms.  But relative to the pace of construction, the number of developed lots is much higher than it was during the boom period.  Despite anecdotes, construction workers' wages construction wages in the past 12 months.  Now, that may be affected by composition and so on, but it doesn't seem to be overwhelming.  In materials, lumber is up about 35 percent, but other commodity prices 2 percent relatively slow point, to be a major concern.

because FHA and the GSEs are are trying to induce more movement into the private sector. economy looks stronger. more slowly, I would suspect that we'll see less increase in house prices and activity will be important for related industries and for employment. Mortgage supply conditions are still tight, in part tightening their standards.  They That hasn't really happened yet.  So that does restrict, to some extent, demand.  But, again, over time, I think the situation will likely improve as prices rise and the Going forward, as supply conditions-that is, availability of homes-continue to improve, and as demand improves but but more activity,

goods: to a lesser extent, consumption; and perhaps even investment in structures.  Now, of with some restraining factors.  The obvious one is the sequestration, and, restraint.  Let's not forget the 'fiscal cliff' deal and the uncertain as well as, I think, an important that got less attention is the global economy.  Q1 growth was reduced by about Â½ percentage point because of weak net exports.  I note that talked about the weakness in China.  The Shanghai stock exchange is down about and commodity prices.  Those things global growth expectations, and I do think there's some risk coming from that. My first overall point is that because of easier financial conditions and other factors, I think that we are seeing some strengthening in private final demand driven by durable housing; course, this is colliding in fact, the whole package of fiscal upcoming debt limit and other factors.  That's very restraint on economic growth.  Another factor GDP Steve Kamin 10 percent in the last two months.  There is a definite slowing there, and you can see it in financial markets by looking at the long-term interest rates are reflecting

April 30-May 1, 2013

certainly why manufacturing has not been a leading sector in the last few quarters. And the weakness in global growth and exports, together with the sequestration, are reasons

I feel like I am a lot more optimistic than some about the underlying fiscal situation economic growth.  That, as I think Governor Tarullo and others pointed out, is going going to be a little bit tougher to read, but I I do think there's some chance for a stronger recovery later year.  This is all relative, of course.  I'm certainly not claiming that we're anywhere near want to be. Overall, again, strength of the private sector.  There are some important restraints, in terms of the and global to mean that the signals for the next few months are think we'll have to do our best.  But in the where we ultimately guess at this point, I'm prepared to a little bit.  Some of the factors affecting PCE inflation do appear to be On the other hand, there is an argument, which was in the same Erceg and Levin I mentioned earlier, that the explanation for the very weak wage growth is this broader the unemployment gap-the fact that there are people just on the force participation who would like to have jobs. Just on inflation, a lot has been said about inflation.  I wait and watch temporary. paper employment gap and not just other side of labor

will end with just one question about the low inflation that we're seeing, without Is it slowing the recovery?  I think there's a little bit of a concern there.  On the one close to target.  That said, of course, if inflation stays low for a time, expected inflation But I think actual inflation can matter as well.  For example, if nominal wages adjust I discussing further the prospects for inflation.  Is the low inflation we're seeing now doing any damage? hand, real interest rates depend on expected inflation, and expected inflation thus far looks to be pretty could come down, and that would raise real interest rates and have adverse effects on economic growth. slowly, then slower-than-expected inflation will raise costs, compress profit margins, reduce

April 30-May 1, 2013

and reduce production, all else equal.  Lower-than-expected inflation can also slow getting, which are the lowest least partly artificial, and we will see some increase. and take a look at this because it's not our employment mandate as well. employment, the process of deleveraging and increase debt burdens.  So low inflation is something, I think, to be worried about.  I do think that the very low numbers we've been we've seen, basically, since the crisis, are at But if that's not the case, we'll have to really come back just a question of our price-stability mandate.  It's also a question of the implications of very low inflation for comments, questions?  [No response]  Okay.  In the spirit of making sure that people you will indulge me, to go to the introduction to the reception.  Jim. Any catch their planes tomorrow, I would like, if policy go-round.  And then we'll stop after that, and then go for a

There is a tension in doing the simulations for FRB/US doesn't really have the dynamics that we think many of the alternative C would be concerned about-namely, things like about financial stability risks or risks to inflation from higher reserves.  We think that got at it.  We were thinking that policymakers who favored that option might rely you would be looking at things apart from just judgment about when to lift the federal funds rate-along the lines of do it that way. MR. CLOUSE.  Well, this is a matter of some discussion among the staff, and maybe David and others alternative C, because policymakers who might favor concerns the reason somebody might choose C is out of concern, in particular, for inflation risk, so that's partly how we on the language in the statement suggesting that the thresholds to make a that one sentence at the end of the statement.  That was the logic behind trying to do it that way, but we certainly needn't a little concerned about it because the Committee is thinking to go in this direction.  And this maybe overstates a little bit what the MR. BULLARD.  Well, I'm about, at some point, trying effects would be if all you want to do is taper, but you're willing to respect the Committee's commitment to the thresholds.

fair point. MR. CLOUSE.  That's a the effects.  My guess, off the top you just said, 'We are going to stick an earlier liftoff,' the unemployment rate would the motivation for choosing MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Yes.  And it does overstate of my head, based on other things we've done, is that if with the thresholds; there is not going to be shift.  That red line would shift halfway back toward the black line.  That's my rough guess. But, as Jim said, we have had a hard time, over time, deciding what

And what alternative C would mean.  Is it a different outlook?  A different assessment of risk? would it imply for the federal funds rate path as well?

expectations. MR. POTTER.  There is also the effect on market the this simulation for alternative C. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Yes.  There is also a signaling effect.  So even if Committee was just bound and determined that the thresholds stick, the market might not interpret it that way, and you'd see an effect that looks like

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.

alternative A.  The first question is, what did you put in there for a A? MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have two questions about the simulations underlying substantial improvement in the labor market outlook-when did you end the purchase program in alternative year, and then ends in the first half of 2014. MR. CLOUSE.  The purchase program in alternative A ends in the first half of 2014.  So it begins to taper later this

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  And my second question is, so A does better on unemployment.  How much of the improvement of A relative to B is due to the change in the purchase program, and how much is due to the lowering of the threshold?

is quite powerful.  I mean, both are gives you a lot of kick.  And David probably can give you the numbers off the top of his head. MR. CLOUSE.  Well, I think the threshold actually important, but the threshold really actual

[Laughter] MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  That's a fine answer.

April 30-May 1, 2013

MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  The threshold itself is worth more than half of the unemployment rate effect.

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you.

believe I wasn't listening carefully alternative C and the implications for the fed funds rate. figure that shows how the funds you have. MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, I enough as Jim was going through the Just so I can understand, you must have been talking about the rate could be lifting off prior to hitting the threshold.  But that's an interpretation that

MR. CLOUSE.  That's the staff interpretation.

I was looking at alternative B and alternative C, with an idea toward trying to understand I favor it, implement earlier tapering in June.  Currently, alternative B, in It seems like a positive statement.  I don't have any you were contemplating alternative C today, paragraph 1 is different interpretation:  'Although the remains elevated, it has declined further, and other indicators of labor market It's still factually correct.  I mean, you could you could see that two good reports.  And then, paragraph 3 has the other reference about 'based on the alternative C being offered up next time as MR. EVANS.  Okay.  So it could happen that way, certainly.  I understand that.  All right. how we would, not that the first paragraph, has language on the labor market:  'Labor market conditions have shown some improvement in recent months.' difficulty with that.  Now, if in fact also intended to be factual although it is a slightly unemployment rate conditions have shown additional improvement.' choose to emphasize that, I suppose-probably not after the March report, but after improvement in the outlook for the labor market since last September.'  Governor Stein and Governor Powell have represented that position, I think, fairly well, that there have been improvements.  So, if we were contemplating

April 30-May 1, 2013

B, would we be putting most of our eggs on the positive developments on the labor in those two reports-in which case it's still up for grabs-or is it going to be the 'Darn lean more on paragraph 3?  Those I look at this language.  Is there one preferred over the of how markets would be looking at this? alternative market it, I just think we need to do this and taper'?  So is it going to are the questions that come to mind as other in the staff's view

In the memo about changing the flow of asset purchases, we you might craft a statement, say, in June, alternative states of the world, as far as the way the data have come in. conditions have been doing at the time you are thinking about doing it, you might not look at all like this alternative C; they different. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. tried to address that issue.  And I don't know whether Steve Meyer wants to talk about it here, but we tried to address that issue by thinking about how or whenever, under Depending on what could be writing very different statements.  They might look considerably

I'm just trying to think this one MR. EVANS.  I'm not sure what my question is; through-does our characterization of labor markets in tomorrow's statement matter a lot for how we set the June decision point, or not?

the weaker data.  So if there is no note strong signal. MR. POTTER.  The market expects some note of of that, it would be a

I've read, is for a CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.  I think the expectation, from what slightly weaker statement.  Governor Duke.

alternative C and in language in the memo on adjusting the pace of asset purchases.  And it 'changing gears' type of language, but more 'this is to me, if we wanted-and, in fact, MS. DUKE.  Also, I would ask about the difference in formulating formulating the tapering seems like there, the language is a little less a step in a continuum' type of language.  So it would seem

April 30-May 1, 2013

I was going to make; now I'm really infringing on the next out of alternative C-the sentence about B.  That markets could interpret as indicating that we were so worried about the But altering the pace of purchases, after the March meeting. this was one of the suggestions round-we take a sentence out of the memo, not adjusting the pace of purchases, which could be up or down-and put it into alternative could be something that weak data that we were setting up the possibility that we were going to increase purchases. it certainly would continue that concept that we are thinking about which we, I think, did introduce pretty successfully

Let me just say a word on what we have already I have a feeling-and it won't take much encouragement-that we have a robust discussion of the tactics and strategy of going forward, and I encourage good memo from the staff that was a starting point, but, obviously, you can encourage constructive interventions.  I hope we can CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay. begun here.  Obviously, tomorrow we will need to make tomorrow's policy decision, and have a statement, and so on.  But will also that.  We got a very go in whatever direction you would like.  I find solutions together about how we can solve some of the communications issues that have come up.  So I hope it will be a good and constructive discussion tomorrow.

want to make just a couple of points about communication opportunities.  First, I am conferred an ad hoc press conference, public, live.  I just want to say that because, as we think about only can act once a quarter.  I mean, I think we I slated to testify before the Joint Economic Committee on May 22.  And, second, I have with Michelle, and we have confirmed that if there was ever a need for conference, we could announce at the time of the statement being released that we were going to have a phone press this, we don't have to necessarily assume that we can act more often than that if we need to; we have the logistics for that.

April 30-May 1, 2013

I think that there obviously are some very difficult questions here.  As we discuss it, you know, we will have an additional item on the agenda on exit But again, I hope that we can think about how we can achieve our policy objectives, but do it in a way that will work from a communications perspective.  So I look forward to that discussion tomorrow.  And then, as principles.  Okay?  President Kocherlakota.

quick thing, to you just said, that I think it would be useful for us to be able to think about.  If going to be elements of the labor market outlook we are going to end up highlighting as criteria by which we are going to adjust policy in June, it might be useful to bring those alternative B in the first paragraph now.  For example, Governor Powell's statement MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Said with such enthusiasm.  [Laughter]  Just a build on what there are being the forward in about the trailing numbers of nonfarm payrolls.

a radical suggestion here.  If you have you would like, would you please send them to Jim or to you make a sheet tomorrow that has just six sentences, for example, Just so we have a sheet that has everything CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let me make sentences, paragraphs, whatever, that Steve Meyer.  And could 'From President Kocherlakota, this sentence'? written down.  And then, that will just be something that will be for reference as we talk about this, in case people have specific suggestions.  Okay?  So just send those things.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  8:30 tomorrow morning.  Let's be reasonable about this,

[Laughter] MR. EVANS.  And when is the cutoff time for that? okay?  [Laughter]

Yes, sir. MR. EVANS.  All right.

Force majeure.  We now have a reception CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right, okay. and dinner.  We will reconvene tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.  Thank you.

[Meeting recessed]

April 30-May 1, 2013

May 1 Session

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good morning.  We've reached item 3 on our agenda.

couple of quick pieces of ad hoc research overnight, which bore on some yesterday, and I thought I would share them with you.  I guess these both Stein's and Governor Powell's comments.  The first had to do with team showed me was that the improvement from the Blue Chip perspective is that from the Tealbook perspective.  In August of last year, the rate prediction by the Blue Chip for the fourth quarter of 2013 was 7.7 percent, now 7.5 percent.  So there's been less of an improvement from the Blue restraint that's come in.  It's still an important point, but I think the The staff did a of the questions from had to do with Governor communication-how expected purchases vary with the news.  One point of interest that David Wilcox and his somewhat less than unemployment and, as of April, it's Chip's perspective.  Of course, on top of that, the Blue Chip has probably been surprised by the additional fiscal policy mystery is reduced, at least a little bit, by that observation.

and which I felt was interesting, is dealer, has actually been pretty Prior to the October FOMC meeting, the total amount of expected for 2013 and 2014 was $1105 billion, and, before the January FOMC meeting, it was $1080 billion, and, before this meeting, it was $1145 billion.  The fact fulfilling what is more or less a constant expectation for the ultimate size of the I'm sure there'll be plenty of discussion and commentary on these issues. The other observation, which is due to Steve Meyer that the total size of the program, as expected by the median constant since October. purchases $1140.  Before March, it was point is that it's not the case that the expected additional purchases, from the point where we are at a point in time, are constant.  In other words, we're not on a treadmill.  As we move forward, we are in program.  I think that does affect at least a little bit of the thinking about exit ramps and so on, but

April 30-May 1, 2013

you like to go first One other thing before we start.  We were expecting at least 30 contributions to the language.  Governor Duke gets the merit badge.  [Laughter]  She submitted this additional sentence, which would go between the third and fourth sentences of paragraph 4, presumably in alternative B.  As we begin our go-round, I wonder, Governor Duke, would and explain this, or would you rather wait?

I can. MS. DUKE.

you go first?  And then, as we go can do that. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Go ahead.  Why don't around, if anyone wants to comment on this suggestion, obviously they

Well, first, I'd like to point out that Jim Clouse didn't get any dinner waiting for all of the new submissions. MS. DUKE. 4 because he was making any changes to policy at this meeting, but I would I found the memo on changing the pace of purchases to really be I'm a lot more concerned than most of you about the cost of a very I'm still willing to admit that, when I reviewed the memo on changing the asset purchases, I found that issuing a statement that said we had run up against an an awful lot like defeat, whether it's a collective his or her own particular pain point.  But at the same time, the and expect monetary policy to offset First of all, I'm not in favor of like the statement from this meeting to leave us in the best possible position to start tapering in June if the data cooperate. quite helpful.  Knowing that large balance sheet, pace of unfavorable cost-benefit tradeoff sounds statement from the Committee or whether it's individual members of the Committee dropping off of this train as each reaches likelihood of getting to the substantial improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions that we originally set as a threshold to end purchases seems like a very long way away, especially if we discount resilience to fiscal drag

April 30-May 1, 2013

ground, and I thought we were converging on a goals-not the 'substantial improvement,' but progress toward I don't think it comes at a large cost.  And it would give us a better signaling to regain control of expectations. sequestration.  So I do see an attractive middle middle ground at the last meeting-that is, the option of stepping down purchases just a bit in response to progress toward our our goals.  This would give us a positive message, and, because the pace could always be increased again, mechanism and allow us yesterday, and as the Tealbook graphs It doesn't rise to the threshold of we wait to react to the noticeable progress, the less plausible it becomes as a reason for a step-down, my question is, what going to see even greater progress, as we go year, than we saw so far?  The longer we wait to adjust the pace, the higher the markets real possibility that we could miss out on a window of by waiting for better news.  I'm not saying that we plan to taper in June regardless of with the direction, especially if it could pull that off without hurting our credibility if Markets expect us to taper sometime, and we're the ones who are going negative. As Governors Stein and Powell pointed out illustrate, we have made noticeable progress since September. substantial improvement that would indicate an end to purchases, but it is noticeable.  And the longer tapering and the more remote becomes our opportunity to point to that progress as a positive result.  So if the progress we've seen so far doesn't justify does it take, and what's the likelihood that we're into the will interpret that bar to be, and there's a good news the data, but if we did have some positive revision to March and got some decent job growth, I think we should at least consider signaling that we're happy comes in spite of the fiscal drag.  I think we we prepare the ground. to have to teach them what to view as positive or

small deceleration in the pace of purchases would have a big effect on In fact, when we first launched the MBS program in September, I believe that the I don't think a efficacy.

The big from adjustment to market expectations, which is exactly what I intend. still truly bothered by the wide gap between market expectations and the assumptions in the can see two ways for this to happen.  We a signal to rein in market expectations as progress is made, or we could the market original pace in the Tealbook was $30 billion a month, and it was only in the last few minutes of the meeting that it was effect of tapering comes I'm Tealbook that reflect the staff's interpretation of the broad center of the Committee.  So I think transparency demands that we reconcile the two, and I could start tapering as stop pretending to believe that we anticipate a program that's much smaller than anticipates and instruct the staff to adjust the Tealbook assumptions accordingly.

were pretty clear about the number of members year and ending by year-end 2013, but Fed completely discounted that signal and even increased their expectations for the timing Since the day we launched the program, I've driven by them.  The B, but I would like the statement for this meeting to build on the concept of we introduced in the press conference and the speeches after the last I thought the minutes of the last meeting who expressed support for tapering sometime this watchers of the adjustments and the ultimate purchase size. been concerned that, rather than driving market expectations, we would be market now seems to expect an unbroken streak of wins, with any stutter along the way restarting the count, and we appear to be on track to validating that expectation.  So I'm in favor of alternative adjusting purchases that meeting.

I've suggested would serve two purposes.  It would set up a that adjusting purchases is a more serious and imminent option than assume that it's a signal that we might increase the I think that the change smooth transition to tapering in June, if that turns out to be appropriate, and it would communicate to markets they now seem to expect.  Even if markets

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

April 30-May 1, 2013

alternative B.  We are projecting large misses on both for this year, and the miss on inflation is getting quite large.  It is ironic for 2015.  The Tealbook forecasts for PCE inflation for both 2014 and 2015 are inflation target is not a distinction for which we should strive.  Inflation falling our target and fiscal austerity that is worse than we expected provide ample alternative B to alternative C.  While the data are not unambiguous, LSAPs seem clear, as the interest-sensitive sectors continue to perform It worries me to history of pulling back on aggressive policy just as their to improve and deflation was receding.  Keeping that lesson in mind, we and likely a major reason why our MR. ROSENGREN.  I support elements of our mandate that, when I looked at the Bank of Japan announcement last week, the median of the Policy Board's inflation forecast, adjusted for the consumption tax, was 1.4 percent for 2014 and 1.9 percent 1.6 percent.  I think one lesson from Japan is that being the major central bank that most undershoots an further below reasons to strongly prefer taken as a whole, labor markets have not improved substantially enough to alter our purchase program.  The benefits of well despite the fiscal headwinds, and the costs to date seem quite modest. know that the Bank of Japan has had a economy was beginning should not pull back from a program that is both working economy is improving better than those of most other developed countries.

mandates.  Each mandate implies the same from our inflation that is, to a large degree, not the strength of labor markets but the weakness in labor force participation, this is We have a dual mandate.  With inflation well below its target and unemployment well above full employment, we do not have dueling policy prescription:  accommodation.  But given the increasing divergence target and the only modest improvement in the unemployment rate reflecting no time to hesitate in our quest to achieve our congressional mandate.

April 30-May 1, 2013

I have no objection to Governor Duke's language, the current draft of alternative B prefer a parsimonious approach when we do not want to change policy data that are quite uncertain.  Thank you, Chairman. While is quite parsimonious.  I and when future action is dependent on incoming Mr.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lockhart.

in the statement MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B as presented.

may be on the table at the next shared my almost gut judgment that the growth of the balance sheet has threshold of Now, with a considered as immediately as the June meeting, I'm concerned about for such a move.  As I said at the I'm skeptical we'll be able to point to tangible as auguring a materially improved outlook.  Claiming an Let me turn to the consideration of tapering, which meeting.  In past discussions, I've expressed concern about the open-ended aspect of the current LSAP program and have to come to an end at some point.  And I somewhat arbitrarily settled on the $4 trillion, beyond which my level of discomfort starts to rise substantially. tapering decision being how the Committee, and the Chairman, explains the rationale end of my economy-round statement, improvement in the incoming data improved outlook with little real-time evidence strikes me as a tenuous position.  So I see the decision to begin tapering as one of satisficing among somewhat conflicting concerns, not the least of which is credibility.

a market reaction that has that effect.  Second, there is the a terminal point for the program, even with preserved.  Third, I have some anxiety about the Committee losing I see three concerns.  First, there is the risk of removing policy stimulus prematurely, and doing so inadvertently by evoking desirable aim, in my view, of suggesting conditionality explicitly

April 30-May 1, 2013

declare victory with respect to labor market improvement with the current levels and broader measures of labor market I'm concerned with how credibly we will be would make a today, and it is in the data. credibility by seeming to unemployment rate anywhere near performance showing spotty improvement at best. able to stick to the spirit of the conditionality around labor market improvement.  I comment about improvement since last September.  The unemployment rate is 7.6 percent versus 7.8 last September.  Since September, there's been very modest improvement in broader measures of the employment markets.  Much of the real improvement occurred between September 2011 and September 2012.  And if there is improvement, it's really in the staff SEP forecasts more than can see myself supporting communication around the decision is very carefully crafted.  I the risk that gradual improvement will not be sustained, and not on the claim that the outlook enough to halt asset purchases.  Related to that an imminent end to the asset purchase program. as the Chairman stated in his last press conference, and as is suggested by the insert conditions evolve.  For the most part, I think that these last two ideas asset purchases, under the header 'Moderate growth in economic activity and As I said yesterday, I believe that it will be necessary Depending on how conditions evolve between now and June, I a decision to begin tapering if the think it will be important to emphasize that the slower pace of purchases is based on a receding of for labor markets has improved substantially point, the tapering decision does not imply And, finally, that Governor Duke would like to put in, the Committee is ready to adjust the pace of purchases up or down as economic are captured well in the staff's illustrative language on page 10 of the memo on changing the pace of employment growth in coming months.' to lean more heavily on improved confidence in the outlook, versus improvement in the outlook

April 30-May 1, 2013

would suggest explicit reference to diminished downside risk as part of per se.  For that reason, I any tapering rationale.

I said, I think the sentence that Governor Duke suggests inserting needs reluctant to signal too much in this meeting's statement.  So, after I would go with the statement as written.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Although, as emphasizing, I'm not ready to support it at this time.  Given that we just don't know how things will look in two months, I'm all of these considerations,

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker.

at 0 to 25 basis points.  My only comment has to do with that I've objected to purchases of MBS, based on our stated or motivation underlying our MBS purchases is that those purchases, with buying a similar amount of U.S. Treasury securities only, are going to be Treasuries, mortgage rates are lower than they would be.  So year or so, and I think that should raise that the housing recovery is incomplete, that it continuing support, or that we pulled the rug out from under it.  I'm not It's not clear to me that we should be expecting this housing market to head back to year, for example, anytime soon, and we can have a debate about whether strength that ought to MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Once again, I fully support maintaining the target range for the federal funds rate agency MBS.  You all know principle that we should avoid credit allocation.  But let's set that objection aside for the moment.  The theory compared reducing mortgage rates to below what they otherwise would be.  By deciding to buy MBS instead of a similar amount of housing activity, presumably, would be stimulated.  That's presumably the objective of our tilt toward MBS.  Housing has been increasing over the last the question as to whether we should begin shifting away from MBS.  I think that needs to be on our agenda.  Now, you might object and say would falter without our sure I agree. 1Â½ million units a that's the case or not.  But surely there exists some level of housing market

April 30-May 1, 2013

from MBS, normalize our balance sheet, and shift back future meetings. cause us to change direction, pivot away to Treasuries.  So I think it's something we need to seriously discuss.  It needs to be a serious option at the our holdings of agency debt and agency MBS into U.S. Treasuries, a gigantic MBS portfolio dumped on the market-just the A larger step, of course, on the MBS side.  But in any event, shifting out of MBS needs to be on One small, minimal step we could take in that direction would be to start reinvesting principal payments from rather than rolling them into agency MBS-so, a gradual shift, as the MBS mature, back into Treasuries.  No wholesale swap of smallest step you could picture us taking, but, I think, a reasonable one. would be to taper our MBS purchases more rapidly than we taper our Treasury purchases or to make all of the tapering the agenda because of the strength we've seen in the housing market.  Thank you.

Thank you.  President Lacker, I've given some thought to credit allocation argument, which I think is an important argument.  I guess the defense I that, in normal times, when the Fed tries to stimulate activity, housing is an actions affect the broader economy.  We don't for housing.  Rather, it's just a tool by which we are getting overall we'd like it to be.  I guess I would argue for the analogy that rather, it is a transmission are I would give. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. your would offer is important transmission mechanism by which our have a goal specifically employment and inflation where we're not particularly interested in the housing sector per se, but mechanism to achieve our broader macroeconomic goals.  Of course, I think your concerns legitimate, but that would be the counterargument

LACKER.  Yes, if I could follow up-there is this correlation.  Obviously, some sensitive than others.  A broad array of risk-free rates fall in and demand falls; demand rises, as sectors are stimulated by lower interest rates, and MR. sectors are much more interest recessions,

April 30-May 1, 2013

come back.  The way we've done things in the past preserves a neutrality or an A corollary of us pushing mortgage rates aiding housing, it's surely shifting resources recovery than one that's neutral, in the traditional sense, about where the recovery they unbiasedness across different interest rate sensitivities. below what they otherwise would be is that, in this recovery, small businesses, for instance, may be paying more than they otherwise would.  If it's from somewhere else.  And I just don't see the analytical basis for thinking that that's going to lead to a better is going to take place.

It's raising overall activity.  It isn't necessarily shifting CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. resources from elsewhere-maybe just utilizing unutilized resources, like construction workers.

I get started, if I may, so I get a sense of what the limits I'd be interested in the staff's definition of what the practical limits are on the size of So, may I ask the staff really quickly, what's a number?  Is there a Lockhart mentioned his discomfort.  Governor But is it $5 trillion?  Is it $10 trillion?  Is it $20 trillion?

I mention this because President Yellen-yesterday, in her intervention-indicated that she was in favor of increased long-term LSAPs. some insight?  Have we considered this? have a sense of dimension?

April 30-May 1, 2013

have to confess that I don't think we have a particular number about the pace of the increase in the focused as much on whether point where the marginal cost of increasing our balance you might imagine, we've never really been in this any sort of empirical evidence to bear on it.  So we'd be I can't really give you a very definitive answer on that. MR. CLOUSE.  I honestly in mind.  As we have talked about, we have some issues balance sheet, and Simon can comment on that.  But we haven't there's a hard limit of some sort or some sheet really starts to kick in.  Of course, as territory, and it's very hard to bring trying to reach that conclusion from a priori reasoning, which is a little bit difficult in the current circumstances.  I'm sorry, but

In July of last year, we sent you a memo.  I think we thought $2 trillion years was the maximum pace that was sustainable.  If we redid those calculations, we go a little bit quicker than that based on the MBS side.  That would get you to As Jim said, what the actual capacity is, I you're talking about a physical limit, then the number is going to be much higher, as we MR. POTTER. over two could probably about $4Â½ trillion, if we start at about $2Â½ trillion. think, is going to depend on issuance after that and some of the costs that we've spoken about. But if can see in Japan right now.

But there is a limit. MR. FISHER.

to calculate the limit is to of raising interest rates.  But in addition to that, we have about reserve-draining tools, which are the reverse repos and the time deposits, So, from a point of MR. POTTER.  There will be a limit because there won't be anything left for us to buy. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher, another way think about our exit tools.  If we were to do alternative A, which is the larger set of purchases, we would end up with about $2.4 trillion in excess reserves.  We have, of course, the interest on excess reserves as a way $1 trillion of capacity and we have about $1.2 trillion in short-term Treasuries that we can sell.

FISHER.  That's helpful, Mr. Chairman.  There is a limit out there; I'm trying to get around what it might be, because one argument could be that, as we go through time, if front, we just continue the to get a sense of what the fence line is. MR. my arms we haven't seen the improvement that we'd like to see on the labor process.  And I'm trying was pretty clear yesterday that, with regard to policy, efficacy of our current policy is questionable and will prove less efficacious as policy and regulatory policy and until the forward with initiatives on the tax and spending and regulatory front that austerity; I want to make that clear-the economy so as to already ultra-abundant and uber-cheap capital that we have engineered in order And one of the most disturbing statistics for me is that, in the last 10 years, in the me is to have a monetary policy that matches or is properly utilized by that is directed so that the middle class, working men and women, are that the rich get richer. Now for my comments on policy.  I I maintain that the long as there is enormous uncertainty about fiscal fiscal authorities come regear-again, I'm not advocating take advantage of to create jobs. two middle income quartiles, we've seen job destruction in the United States, not job creation. The important thing for the fiscal authorities and the beneficiaries-not just the rich, so

Abenomics last year and the third arrow.  Clearly, we need a third are operating in a fog of uncertainty.  If you look at the cap-ex numbers, we're back to with real job-creating capacity and commitment, I mentioned Japan's arrow-structural change-and no further amount of monetary accommodation will solve that problem.  Businesses simply cannot make decisions under conditions of total uncertainty, and they 2007.  What we want to see is additional cap-ex

April 30-May 1, 2013

I just don't believe that will be made until that uncertainty fog has lifted.  We at the Dallas carefully at this issue and are working with Professors Baker and Bloom up.  But there is a price to uncertainty, whether it is the 1.5 million whom, they claim, fiscal uncertainty has waylaid or a shaving of GDP growth by and Fed have been looking of Stanford and with Professor Davis of Chicago.  They've tried to put some numbers on the price of uncertainty.  You may or may not buy their theories.  We're going to have a conference on that, which is coming workers 2.3 percent.

It may be temporary, or it may be more permanent phenomenon, but it is further monetary accommodation can change that.  Yes, the markets might have a reaction if we were to indicate-even to the degree Betsy has suggested, which I support-that we might begin to taper.  As Jim pointed out But as Governor Stein argued yesterday, I don't believe we should allow ourselves to be placed in an expectational trap. What's their record for accuracy?

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. expectation-you're right, but market expectations control the decisionmaking process, and we should simply do what's right for the economy.  I believe that the right thing to do is to begin tapering now.  But a vote, I don't expect people to listen to me at this

However, so far, as we've been about both yesterday and today, market participants don't seem to be receiving the expecting the end of the purchase year.  Given that the primary dealers seem to be A, I believe that the signal from the minutes and the statements should be a bit firmer. At our upcoming June meeting, our purchase program will have been under way for nine months.  In my view, the the labor market data have improved since we began the purchase program. have discussed at length the possibility of talking message that the program could be smaller than $1 trillion.

But, frankly, I and still think that the size of the program is going to be, ultimately, about don't really see any conflict per se there.

since our March meeting suggest that the recovery's momentum I worry that it may be receding.  While it still seems premature to you did, Mr. Chairman-a diversity of viewpoints on that around the aren't encouraging, and picking up any momentum in the again seems to be taking another March payroll employment was a far cry from the 200,000 pace that I market. Economic developments has not increased.  And in fact, explicitly mark down my outlook, the risks seem, to me, decidedly weighted to the downside, although I did hear-as table.  The incoming spending data near term is likely to be challenging, as business planning cautionary stance.  The look to as an important measure of substantial improvement in the labor yesterday on interpreting what constitutes got at very carefully what I was trying to come to grips the labor force margin are two I thought Governor Yellen's comments maximum employment were terrific.  She with myself by asking questions.  The unemployment margin and

And I had taken note of the very interesting one.  If cautionary note that, by overly conservative-that in fact, in order to get to the maximum employment gains that Governor Yellen was talking about, we might need to do even more.  Now, difficult for many to take on board in their own views.  For me, it's a robustness cautionary note, which is, there's uncertainty about what the right policies are.  I think that the optimal control policies that we see in the Tealbook for some of these labor force margins.  I find myself quite comforted by these additional results.

heightened.  I thought President Kocherlakota circulated a very interesting come to grips with trading off these two risks:  dealing with not only the scale of what we saw before-small probability, but very bad outcome. to me that that got to the focusing on getting the economy going. Financial markets continue to be functioning well, even while economic risks around the world remained memo on how we might state of the economy, but also the potential risk that a financial blowup would lead to an increase in unemployment on the And when you balance those against our policy loss function, it seemed right answer, which is, we need to continue yet.  I think we've made different view.  I haven't always expressed it this way; maybe I have. I thought that we could run $85 billion per month all the way, until we got to the end of the program, and then we basically stopped.  So, on that viewpoint, I could going to end up with a $1 trillion program, something bigger than For me, I haven't seen substantial labor market improvement good progress, but the downside risks do worry me.  My own expectation for the open-ended program-I had a slightly But program.  It wasn't obvious to me that we had to do tapering.  In fact, with QE2, we didn't do tapering; we did the full have imagined that we were

April 30-May 1, 2013

came to the same assessment.  That what we have said.  So I do we've been talking and what their expectations are. QE2.  And the dealers and the experts who've looked at that doesn't make them right; it's just that they seem to be following worry a little bit about how to end, I think I worry about the tapering.  If we're going to do that, I think that we a faithful revelation of our intentions for the size of the program and what 'openIf in fact we intend that $750 billion is as much as we're going to do, ought to be willing to say that.  If we don't, then that could cause a lot I prefer.  But if we were to go down that Just need to have ended' means after that. no matter what, then we of heartburn with the markets.  That's not the view that path, I think we ought to do something like that.

guess I do prefer that every time somebody talks about forecasting, I'm not aware of who forecasts well.  I think the answer to the question 'Did X ever forecast well?' is will lead markets to come in very ready to increase the pace for quite another reason.'  And if we did that, I couldn't a June tapering, if the markets got it wrong.  So there are some risks involved in that. Lastly, on Governor Duke's language, I could go either way on that.  I parsimony.  I would point anybody always, 'No, nobody does.'  The history of forecasting what new language infer is about as tough an exercise as anything that we do.  I would take note that, by mentioning that this is going to depend on inflation changes, given that the inflation data have low, it would not surprise me if markets jumped all over that and said, 'Oh, it looks as though they're about imagine Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Plosser.

I indicated in the last go-round, I think survey and expectations of the size of the MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As that there's been little change in our economic outlook since the last meeting.  The forecasts are very similar.  Based on the New York Fed dealer

April 30-May 1, 2013

policy has eased in the intermeeting period.  According to the dealers' with $1.22 trillion in March, and they expect us to be buying until the of 2014.  In my view, these expectations seem going forward.  On the other hand, if these are really own current view, as in the expectations in the Tealbook.  So there continues to be somewhat of a mismatch reaction function be driven by what the market I'll come back to that in a moment. balance sheet, monetary median forecasts for Treasury and agency MBS purchases, the program size is now estimated to be $1.37 trillion, compared second quarter of 2014 rather than the first quarter to be based on rather volatile monthly data and could easily be shifted again, upward or downward, depending on what happens forecasts of our behavior, then they seem to be somewhat at odds with our expressed here about what they think our reaction function is.  What we have to be careful about, I guess, is not to let our decisionmaking process and our perceives our reaction function to be, when in fact we haven't articulated what that reaction function is.  And I think that's this expectational trap, in part, that we have to be careful of.  We haven't really articulated that reaction function.  But if we are unable to live by what we have said-which is that we can move the program up or down, depending on the data-then it's important that we be able to demonstrate that.

would favor bringing the current LSAP program to a close as soon as practicable, at year-end.  I see the economic benefits of the program as quite limited and the costs we approach exit, I think that the size of the balance more and more as we get closer to changing course.  Ending the LSAPs reports, together with the improvement we've and hours worked, would allow us to begin tapering, I least by rising with the size of our balance sheet.  As sheet is going to matter would serve us well in terms of reducing potential future problems with exit.  We have two employment reports between now and our next meeting.  To me, employment growth in the 120,000-plus range, averaging over those two already seen in the unemployment rate

April 30-May 1, 2013

I don't think we should have embarked on this program or this path, given indicated that we will move it up or down as appropriate, we should be consistent with an improving labor market.  Scaling back does not mean stopping, necessarily, and we need to add credibility to our statements that we are willing to move it up and down as economic conditions improve.  I think that a failure to do that would undermine our own credibility.  While that we have done so and willing to demonstrate that as the data improve.

would not favor coupling such a move with a change in forward guidance that suggests In particular, I would not favor lowering the I believe that such a move would be be misinterpreted.  They will not understand why we are what circumstances we might change it yet again.  What we are trying to goal that we think we can achieve.  I think that's a dangerous a good chance I believe that the Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Strategy, that we do not have a numerical goal for that portion of our mandate. I we would be keeping rates lower longer for now. unemployment threshold, as is suggested in alternative A. very confusing to the public and likely doing this or under achieve, in their mind, would be highly confusing.  The public already is thinking of the unemployment threshold as a notion.  Moreover, regardless of what we say, the public seems to be dismissing the inflation threshold as irrelevant.  If we lower our unemployment threshold to 5Â½, there's that the public will interpret this as a message that inflation will not be a problem as long as the unemployment rate is above 5Â½ percent.  That probably strains credibility. public will view the 5Â½ as our ultimate goal for unemployment.  This in turn runs counter, in my view, to our reaffirmation in January, in our Statement on Policy considerable uncertainty surrounding the steady-state unemployment rate and Lowering the There's how much of the increase we've seen over recent years has been permanent or not. unemployment threshold raises the probability that our inflation threshold will be reached before

April 30-May 1, 2013

Inflation expectations seem quite stable now, but we don't really know how are until a problem arises.  I would not want us to be in a situation where we've set when the unemployment rate is so far away from our threshold and inflation rising.  Because it's a threshold, we won't have to act.  After all, we've said that they when either of our thresholds is met.  And the more we try to manipulate them, cautious in lowering unemployment thresholds or moving them around the unemployment threshold.  Most of our memos place no probability, or very little probability, on this action.  I think, however, that moving to that threshold would make that probability increasingly likely. fragile they an unemployment threshold so low, and then be put in a position where we have to decide whether to move seems to be are thresholds and not triggers.  But if we don't act, how will we be interpreted by the public? Will they think we've abandoned our target?  Will they understand how much above 2Â½ we'll allow inflation to go before acting?  This Committee has not communicated anything about how we will behave the more confusing the meaning of these thresholds becomes.  Until we have a better sense of how we would act in each of these scenarios and can answer such questions among ourselves, I think we should be very as if they were some kind of moving target.

policy.  I'm becoming increasingly reach for yield.  Moreover, as President Bullard has counterproductive to the extent that it fosters going to be in a bad state, with low economic growth and for a long time.  The possibility of multiple equilibriums makes forward in fact in this bad state, or a less good state, an equilibrium where the steady-state unemployment rate is 6 percent or I have other concerns about our zero-interest-rate concerned that it's fostering buoyancy in asset markets and spurring some investors to take on more risk than they intend to do as they expressed in the past, I worry that it can be expectations that the economy is deflationary pressures guidance, I think, difficult to use.  Suppose we are equilibrium, and it's

April 30-May 1, 2013

current threshold, but higher than 5Â½, as in alternative A. reach that point could ensure that we stay in very poor outcomes maybe higher-perhaps lower than our Committing to keep interest rates at zero until we that bad equilibrium.  A zero-interest-rate commitment would prolong the that we're trying to avoid.

I can support alternative B today, I would like to see us begin setting the stage ways to increase it.  As can support Governor Duke's suggestions for the change.  I'm comfortable I would also note that, if you look across all of the policy rules summarized in the the unconstrained rules is now very close to zero, suggesting that policy were missing on both that policy is about right.  They don't call for wide range of rules.  I think we can wait from zero with our funds rate, but I would be very cautious in what is already expected in the So while for dialing back the degree of policy accommodation, rather than seeking to the language, I with that. Tealbook, the average of is about right.  Each of those rules, by the way, recognizes, in fact, that we sides of our mandate, and yet they tell us significant increases in accommodation based on that for a while before we move away assuming or indicating that it will be a very long time relative to marketplace.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard.

you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to follow up on President Plosser's you think of a normal Taylor rule, it will tell you gap is such and such and if the inflation rate is such and such.  It'll give you a be set appropriately, given those readings, so whether you're missing the story.  The story is, where are you?  Obviously, we're at the zero many other policy actions since we've been at the zero bound. MR. BULLARD.  Thank comment there, which I think is very important.  It is often said around the table that we're missing on both sides of the mandate.  But if where to be if the number.  The policy will on both sides is not really bound, but we've taken

April 30-May 1, 2013

I support alternative B.  I also support Governor Duke's good.  I agree very much with her comments today, which I good to start this session.  My goal would be to set up the Committee to make I think that this would ability to do that.  We want to be able to recognize noticeable progress in labor come in, but, at the same time, you don't want to 'Well, game over, and everything is good.'  To be able to make small moves in reaction to I think this is an appropriate way for the All right.  For today, I counsel patience.  I think we should get more data-that seems to be where most people are today-and amendment, which I think is very thought were very a move either way during the summer, if the Committee desires, and reinforce our markets in a smooth way, without saying that substantial progress has already been achieved. You don't want to be blind to the data that have say, the data is highly beneficial to the Committee.  So Committee to behave in this environment.

you make a change in the pace of purchases. It's still a very aggressive policy.  It's still a monetary policy that is an easier stance.  And something to also mull over is that, even if you change the not change.  I think the notion of changing you've seen the news that has come in, and you've reacted and interpret that.  I'll stop there I want to also stress the point that, suppose We're still buying assets. moving toward pace of purchases, the total size of the program may the pace of purchases is to signal that to it and given a verdict on it, and the markets can go from there on that.

adjusting expectations in response to shocks.  As news adjust their ideas about the amount of accommodation that will be expectations are intertwined as part of the general equilibrium.  Bad when changes in incoming data do not affect expectations of policy actions.  So I do think markets are clearly comes in, markets definitely offered by this Committee.  To me, this is a critically important part of how private-sector expectations and policy policy would be

April 30-May 1, 2013

and the policy looks the same; the data come in worse, and the policy you're not reacting at all to the bad news comes in and the market pushes up the is part of the equilibrium.  And to me, good aspect of what we've been able to achieve with our open-ended QE program.  So I how it works.  In fine and is serving the Committee well. the data come in better, looks the same.  That is one of the worst policies because changing state of the economy.  The notion that size of the program or the pace of purchases, or vice versa that's a do not think that this is an expectations trap.  This is an equilibrium; this is normal times, with interest rate targeting, good news would come in, the private sector would adjust their interest rate path expectations, and this would be perfectly appropriate.  I think that that part is working

I said earlier in this meeting, inflation is low by our preferred measures.  This is a watching, and I absolutely think it's very important that the Committee I said that you look at the CPI, it doesn't seem as low.  Inflation expectations do seem better anchored were in the fall of 2010, when they were also drifting down badly, I thought.  So I year-over-year PCE inflation rate.  And if you're going to say a critically important part of our credibility. As concern to me.  It bears defends the inflation target from the low side if that becomes necessary.  Now, as yesterday, I do expect inflation to turn around.  I appreciated President Pianalto's comment if than they think we're still okay on this, but this bears watching.  This has been a trend, all through 2012 and now into 2013, on the 2 percent, you'd better defend 2 percent.  That's reiterate that I do not think we should end or taper the asset purchase program I think that would be that we've had enough, we've reached some kind of Let me solely because of an arbitrary cap on the size of the balance sheet. extremely damaging to the Committee at this juncture because it would take a tool, probably our most potent tool, off the table.  To just say limit, and we're stopping would really put the Committee in a difficult position.  It would mean

This is a little bit of cold extent that there's risk to be taken there, we have other examples globe where that risk has been taken.  Not that I want to go too far, but I do think we sheet, really enough room to maneuver to good way through 2013 and into 2014.  But I also think it's important to you don't do that, then it's going to The Fed's balance sheet has also been very large in the past.  If you '30s, for instance, the Fed's balance sheet was quite large at that that the only policy tool at our disposal is a forward-guidance tool because, as President Plosser was just talking edged sword.  It make a couple of comments.  The Fed's balance sheet as a percentage of GDP is not as big as the other major central banks' balance sheets as percentages comfort, but to whatever around the have room to maneuver on the size of the balance carry out this policy in a adjust the pace of purchases in reaction to incoming news.  If be too stagnant of a policy. look at the historical data in the time.  So it's not that this is really unprecedented in U.S. history.

yesterday.  I think it has improved modestly.  Obviously, I understand that.  But we have made progress, able to somehow acknowledge progress when it does occur.  I think that's the during the summer and fall here.  All right.  Thank you very much. Has the labor market improved?  I'd like to associate myself with the comments of Governor Stein and Governor Powell we're not completely at our goal.  That's fine; and we should be essential feature of policy

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Williams.

entirely appropriate.  And as I discussed yesterday, there are MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  The current stance of policy remains encouraging signs of progress in the outlook for the labor market, but we have yet to meet the substantial-improvement test.

April 30-May 1, 2013

I like the fact that alternative B I would make is, I noticed that last time, to paragraph 4 the words 'as well as the extent of progress toward its I saw that as an attempt to get this conditionality in there.  So it seems to Duke's suggestion would be to add another sentence to that.  I thought that In the end, I I'm fine with the suggested addition, but I'm just not that confident it will change In terms of Governor Duke's suggestion, I have to admit didn't change much from last time.  But one comment we actually did add economic objectives.' me that Governor maybe we could say, 'Really,' or something like that [laughter] to get this point across, because that was the effort we made last time-maybe a fancy script or italics or something. think that things that much.

I expect that we'll ease up on the accelerator and begin to asset purchases.  This will present us with a delicate communication challenge of without causing market participants to interpret commitment to keep aggressive monetary stimulus in place even as the So, looking ahead to that day, I think that paragraphs 3 and 4 of C provide a good template for this purpose.  To me, it's very important that the that it's very important get to that point to reaffirm our commitment to continue purchases until the outlook for Now, in my view, the time to completely halt our asset purchases is still a ways down the road.  As we approach that milestone, taper our announcing a reduction in the pace of purchases this as a lessening of our recovery strengthens. alternative language makes it clear that we're adjusting the pace of purchases in response to improving conditions.  I just think that's an important part of our communication, when and if we choose to taper-that it's really in response to improving conditions.  The second is when we the labor market has improved substantially.  Thank you.

I discussed in the last gostatement says that, accommodation, so I'm how we can provide Now, I say 'if we can'-I think there are in fact a number of ways that we We could buy more assets, we could could lower the unemployment rate threshold, or we though, we don't need to be choosing among these tools in isolation.  Monetary stimulus given our multiple tools. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As round, I believe that without further policy accommodation we will be falling short of both of our dual mandate objectives over the medium term.  The January principles if we can, we should seek to mitigate such deviations by providing more perturbed that so much of the conversation around the table is really about less accommodation. could provide the needed boost to our stimulus program: lower the interest on excess reserves, we could communicate about policy during exit.  And I'll talk about all of these briefly.  Just to be clear, depends on the future evolution of the total package of accommodation.  We could create any given arc of stimulus in a number of ways to provide more accommodation-and the one that, I guess, is being assets per month, as is A.  I'm not opposed to doing this, but I do see problems with a faster Fisher highlighted in his others have hinted at, there's some kind of cap out there that people feel One way contemplated in Governor Duke's sentence, for example-is to buy more described in alternative open-ended purchase program of this magnitude.  It seems that the asset purchase program is not well designed to be the kind of open-ended tool we'd like.  As President remarks, and as

April 30-May 1, 2013

It's uncomfortable with it. purchase program; they don't work well together.  So I don't think that would be the way would go-to try to provide extra accommodation through alternative A. considerations, I think that we might want to downplay this tool in favor of moving to other forms of accommodation, of the kinds rate on excess reserves.  I think we can do this. act on this-and I'm not a lawyer; we have lawyers who could speak to thisof my academic friends are quick to point out limited stimulative consequences. Another approach is to cut the interest My reading of the seems to be that we can't make it negative.  A lot that we should make it negative, but it doesn't seem as though it's legally possible.  But if we can't make it negative, this kind of move is going to have only

more effective.  The first is one that I've concerns in his remarks.  So let me talk about those.  One concern that Tealbook raise is that the promises about the future path of the fed funds going out and buying billions of dollars' worth of I think about the economics of the program, the buying of an asset is largely stimulus.  After all, we go buy an asset and go sell it the next day-it anything in terms of providing stimulus.  The stimulus that comes from any expects us to keep the asset, which is, again, a about the public's expectations of expectations concern our asset Let me turn to the two steps that I would view as discussed at some length-lowering the unemployment rate threshold to 5Â½ percent.  The Tealbook and the staff memos expressed several concerns about this move, and President Plosser has also expressed some the staff memos and the rate are somehow less tangible than actually assets.  But as irrelevant in terms of the really hasn't done asset purchase depends on how long the public promise of some kind.  Basically, monetary policy is always our implicit promises about future accommodation, whether those

So this tangibility argument doesn't have much bite, at least with me. all seem to boil down to one main idea, and I think that President Plosser was going to really introduce a lot of challenges and complications, public typically seem to understand that our with a number of remarks that President Plosser has made in public, and in this need to be clear about our reaction function.  I think these remarks are desired clarity.  Right now, we do not say anything about what we're between 5Â½ and 6.4 percent.  Lowering the rate at its level when the unemployment rate is in that interval. holdings or interest rates. The other concerns getting at this, too-that the public sees the thresholds as being somehow fixed and immutable, and so changing them is especially with respect to credibility.  Now, probably more than other people around this table, I've spent time talking to members of the public and to the press about lowering thresholds, and I discount these concerns.  Both the media and the commitment on the thresholds is asymmetric.  The commitment constrains the upward movement of the unemployment threshold, as opposed to its downward movement.  I'm very sympathetic meeting room, about the spot-on.  The lowering of the unemployment rate threshold from 6Â½ to 5Â½ is in fact only designed to provide that going to be doing when the unemployment rate is threshold provides clarity about what we'll do.  We will keep the fed funds extraordinarily low about way around this problem of viewing that immutable and still lowering the threshold.  We leave the current add a new paragraph to the statement.  And this Committee has not previously communicated So, with that in mind, suppose we did want to view our previous language thresholds as being immutable.  There's a simple previous threshold being threshold paragraph exactly as it is, and we separate paragraph states three things.

That would actually distinguish the nature of our reaction I think my point is simply, we want more clarity about our a way to provide more clarity, and it's a way to also provide stimulus, at once.  We're not changing our previous communication about the word, the same.  We're simply a complementary paragraph to the statement that serves to provide more clarity about an our reaction function. information about what it's planning to do in that interim.'  Finally, 'the Committee anticipates that it will keep the fed funds rate at its current extraordinarily low level when the unemployment rate is between 5Â½ percent and 6.4 percent.'  And then we have the inflation caveats, which are important; other caveats in our other threshold paragraph-we could have different caveats here if we wanted.  That would be function even more clearly.  But reaction function; this is so it's doing both things Committee's reaction function in any way.  It remains, word for adding entirely distinct aspect of

We could announce that we expect to hold assets until maturity.  We could announce that come back to this in our next go-round-we could provide information about our policy exit process.  We could say that we plan to withdraw accommodation slowly as now, our current exit strategy principles rule out all of these I'm hoping that, following up on our discussion later today, we I've already indulged your time enough, but let me quickly talk about communication about the eventual withdrawal of accommodation.  This communication could take a number of forms: we expect not to halt reinvestments.  We could announce that we plan to withdraw accommodation more slowly than in prior tightening episodes.

Doing that alone just sends totally the wrong message-it challenging for me to explain that in the context of the other messaging we have Mr. Chairman, my outlook clearly calls for adding more some people earlier this I'll be successful in persuading the Committee to do that today.  But others in my house going out and doing something about it.  My wife some extra accommodation to the economy.

If trying to achieve in terms stand up and articulate, when I'm yes, we're satisfied with what we're doing on unemployment, so we're cutting back on what we're doing on would be very about how we want to support the recovery as long as it doesn't have inflation pressures.  If we do want to taper the LSAP because of these concerns about the exit, we really want to be pairing that tapering with something else to provide extra accommodation.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

This means a higher estimate reduces the implied cumulatively, the Tealbook projection for the unemployment rate revised down 0.6 percentage point since September.

If the pace of improvement in labor market conditions turn out to be more modest, but nonetheless sustained, I could envision beginning to taper, say, at the September meeting using statement language along the lines growth in economic activity and employment contrast, we decide to taper asset purchases because of a changed and costs, we will owe the public a coherent account of what we've learned program that has now illustrative statement language that the staff prepared for the demonstrates, in my view, just how difficult it will be to explain why winding down our for reasons we did not already know at the time we started the program.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.

I've noticed that there seems to be disagreement among people whose go in the same direction-that is, those who have more accommodationist directed to those of us who think of ourselves as somewhere in the middle.  There are, groups, although, as I say, there's more disagreement within those real benefits coming from that inflation or other problems were just around the corner.  The second comfortable and doesn't see much risk associated with LSAPs.  So, for them, it's a question of, when do you see improvement?  For whatever group that is-and I won't MR. TARULLO.  Boy, there is a lot of disagreement around the table.  What this time-and it just struck me-is instincts generally instincts and those who have less accommodationist instincts.  I guess, then, that my remarks are probably roughly speaking, three groups than I had anticipated.  One group was always skeptical of any the LSAPs and feared group is pretty basically

April 30-May 1, 2013

many people are in the middle-I think Jay and Jeremy have, for some get into a circumstance in which economy, in which things are not demonstrably showing terms I used last time, a reasonably high plateau-but they're also not assign a number of how time now, identified the issue, which is, what happens if we there is a tepid performance of the improvement-or, in the deteriorating?  And this is the concern, I think, that both of them expressed again yesterday.

one could share that concern to a lesser or greater degree and still think that economic situation since the March meeting has looked less bright.  The moderate getting from the program-and I do think it's a little hard to deny that there are you think they're as great as or greater than the Tealbook says may going into the period in which the the maximum contractionary effect on the economy.  So any I also said last time, whatever the costs, whether they're reasonably foreseeable, or attend continuation or LSAP program, it seems hard for me to believe that these costs are greater whether we started ending or tapering in June or sometime later in the year. fixed-income markets may happen whenever we slow down, but it seems general economic conditions haven't been good enough to unlikely to be substantially greater with So, as I sit here today-this is a very limited I believe that this would be an odd time to indicate any movement toward tapering or ending the program.  If anything, the benefits we're moderate benefits; whether be debatable-seem particularly worth maintaining, as we're sequestration is going to have implication that we're starting to think more seriously or look forward to June as a tapering moment would seem dissonant at this moment, both on substantive and on presentational grounds.  As the concerns, which I share, about the unknown unknowns that may eventual termination of the materially The potential roiling of to me at least more likely to happen if start pushing longer-term rates higher.  And the unknown unknowns, which might become greater as the balance sheet itself gets larger, seem several hundred billion dollars more of purchases.

a reasonably low probability that, by June, we're going to be able to I don't foreclose the possibility that it will And certainly, if there are strong numbers in the next couple of months, good evidence that there was substantial observation-it seems to me look through the sequestration and make a judgment as to whether that underlying momentum in the economy promises substantial improvement.  But be the case. notwithstanding the sequestration, that would be pretty improvement.

Betsy's language, it might have been preferable if we had included that given a bit of the flexibility that people, I think, already suggested possibilities for its misinterpretation in either going one way you, I'd be happy to go in that direction as well. Finally, on language at the outset, because it would have would like to have.  Several have direction right now.

And the costs of continuing the program at the policy right now.  That said, the economy might be strong June if the next two labor reports look more encouraging.  If the unemployment rate has fallen considerably further by the time of the next meeting and the panoply of other labor indicators suggest that this is consistent with some real improvement in labor markets, tapering might well be in order.  This response to the incoming data would be consistent with the conditional guidance we have conditional stance.  Indeed, it likely have already anticipated data were not absolutely clear that employment conditions had ever?-somewhat better-than-expected data might still warrant LSAPs, and thus the implied total stock, in a continuous way, as a switch that is either on or off, seems like a more sensible reaction to the reality world.  We may want to taper in response to data that seem to mend.  In other that the odds of continued a little higher.  In other words, we can link tapering not to the clear and present Even if the labor market improved-and when are they some tapering.  Setting the flow of rather than that the flow of data is rarely definitive in real time about whether conditions have actually improved.  Instead, we are always interpreting the data and updating the odds that we place on the possible states of the significantly improve the probability that the labor market is finally on the words, the unemployment rate has come down a lot since September, and, now that it has stayed low so long, a moderate further improvement could suggest improvement are signs of an improved outlook, but rather to the higher probability that we're going to see significant improvement.  Of course, in a parallel fashion, worse-than-expected developments

April 30-May 1, 2013

would then lower the odds of improvement and thus lead to a higher flow of asset purchases again.

And other accommodative policies FOMC that exists in 2015 and 2016 honoring the statements that we make now. action we are doing now-in other words, the making ourselves look less committed.  If we pull back on LSAPs for would we then not raise the funds rate because of costs associated with a low In other words, it seems completely believable, and even logical, that the FOMC come to believe that the long period is causing froth in some markets. But if we say that the rationale for tapering is that it's the costs of the become critically high, then, in the absence of solid improvement in labor may be the cause of unintended contractionary functioning and stability this would then cast doubt on how committed we are to our thresholds or staying lower for longer.  Of course, we could try to replace the LSAP program with related to exit.  That might work, but it relies, once again, on us being credible or, more precisely, on the So we would be taking away the one operational LSAPs-and would be costs today, why fed funds rate? might next throw aside the threshold if we or our successors of low rates et al. memo suggests that tapering with the rationale of costs and efficacy are their words-'driving through a fog.'  Just as a driver may slow in a fog, collecting more analogy of driving you get at would suggest that, even with a tapering, under this rationale, we would The Carpenter is like-and these the FOMC might wish to slow the expansion of the SOMA portfolio while information about the economy, efficacy and costs, and other factors.  The through a fog makes some sense from the perspective of the need to still drive until your destination, which, for us, still must be maximum employment in the context of price stability.  So the analogy

April 30-May 1, 2013

LSAPs are complete.  But do drivers in the fog really 'I can't get to my destination,' and they see that it's too destination.'  So it that, absent a real fog, we certainly don't want markets thinking that we're driving might not conclude the trip.  Or they may very we didn't do a good job of anticipating the fog, and they will no doubt ability to ever drive through fog again. continue onward through the fog until our keep driving?  Sometimes they say, dangerous to keep trying.  Sometimes they say, 'Let me pull over and stop driving for a while, try a different route, or change my plans altogether and head to a different appears to me in a fog, because they will then conclude that we well wonder why completely doubt our for tapering would be underlying economic improvement.  The tapering would be an increased probability that economic improvement issues that not only may kill the chances of a stronger recovery now, also might impair the ability of the FOMC to ever again credibly attempt to drive a recovery rationales are high, but, in the scenario in which we taper solely because could be significant and persistent damage to the credibility in order to ameliorate a period of severe economic weakness. The best rationale second-best rationale for is higher, even a little higher.  The third-best rationale, no improvement but costs that exceed benefits, carries credibility but with a mixture of balance sheet and communication tools.  The communication challenges inherent in each of these of the costs associated with LSAPs, the communication challenges may well include the need to determine how to counteract what that a central bank needs

will stop there and mention that, in terms of Governor Duke's suggested language, I I would observe that it doesn't, to me, harmonize well with the sentence that comes afterward, the sentence that we added last time.  If also the size and composition.  It's also a sentence that is a look back-a look back, I have no objection to it in principle.  But completely you look at the sentence that follows the proposed addition, it is a sentence that mentions not just the pace, but

April 30-May 1, 2013

well as costs and efficacy.  The new sentence because it looks back at the extent of progress, as addresses only pace-not pace, size, and composition-and it appears to be a look ahead.  So while, standing alone, it appears to me to be perfectly fine, I do wonder what, if any, kinds of interpretations it might get when it's thought to harmonize with the next sentence.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Stein.

That might address that, but I think, on MR. STEIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  I also support Governor Duke's proposed language Charlie pointed out, which is, with the inflation language in there, it could potentially be interpreted as suppose balance, I would go with it.

I'm planning to argue in favor of tapering.  I expect to do so for now and then-just to as the payroll numbers are in, say, the upper 75 or that we should begin to taper in June.  In the upper if the news that comes in is better than expectations-I think the case least reasonably widely shared, so I won't dwell on it.  The more the lower you want to try to make the argument, it hinges entirely on control and I alluded to in the previous go-round and is largely that-a number of Looking forward to June, a relatively large range of outcomes.  For the news that comes in between calibrate, loosely speaking-as long 80 percent of the distribution, my own view is part of that-that is to say, is easy to make and is at challenging argument-and I'm clearly, as Dan pointed out, in the minority-concerns part of the distribution, where you might characterize the news as disappointing but not really terrible.  I think if communication issues of the sort that divorced from views about efficacy and cost.  I want to note parenthetically people have made this point, and I share the sentiment-on net, our actions have been more

April 30-May 1, 2013

I think the you were to all that confident about the state of the economy, and I think we may a while longer.'  I might say, 'Well, okay, but then it's important-and all the more important, if we're going to be in this business for a while-that we good handle on our communications technology for it so that we're going to be in going to be held hostage to market expectations that sometimes respond efficacious than I would have anticipated in September.  I want to set that aside. argument for doing something in June is divorced from that.  And in fact, suppose tell me in June, 'I'm not need to be at this for maybe even have a pretty control and we're not quite strongly to transient data.'

guess this is where I maybe differ-to handle the pretty constructive way without got overtaken by cost-or otherwise doing things that damaging.  Done right, it's credibility- preserving, and here I'm really just taking would say in this more difficult case. we would say is that, in thinking about a decision to taper, because  it's the first on the cumulative information that we've had since September.  And then I spite of the month-toadded up to something about the Bullard mentioned.  In a stock-based world, changing In other words, it's a reduction of the rate at accommodation in the face of an economy that's improving maybe not as Moreover, I think it's possible-I messaging in this intermediately disappointing case in a declaring defeat-without saying that we are credibility off on some of the themes in the staff memo.  Here's what I The first thing time we've revisited it since September, the appropriate thing to do was to condition not just on recent news, but also would allude to the forecast revisions we've had since September-that, in month choppiness and the fact that we're facing fiscal headwinds, they've meaningful.  I would take the fiscal headwinds on board but say, in terms of a message underlying strength of the economy, that the net progress is indicative of something.   I would refer, again, to something that President the rate of purchases is a second-derivative move. which we're adding

April 30-May 1, 2013

would like, but is improving nevertheless.  So it's still a pretty aggressive policy.  I gone down a little bit.  Then, of course, as the that we're prepared to adjust, either up or been explicit about central part of our communications and we don't change the rate of flow, you, the market, never we think we are relative to where things are trying to go.  I think that, as that we can turn an important premise.  And if going to be in this business for another nine months, we want to be able to show that it's a That's, to me, the essence of the argument, and that's where I would hope fast as we would stress, again, that, in addition to whatever cumulative progress we've had, it seems somewhat clear that the downside risks have recent data readings remind us, there are still headwinds, and we're still not where we would like to be.  As we continue onward, we would reiterate down, in the face of incoming news.  Indeed, precisely because we haven't our stopping rule, this variation in the pace is inevitably a technology.  And if we're rigid really learn about where President Bullard and others have pointed out, we want to establish a premise this dial after nine months and nine months' worth of news; that is we're dial that we can turn. to be pointing toward in June.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Powell.

B at this when and why to taper, but, first, I want to put I do continue to see moderate benefits from asset purchases, I think they are evident.  The asset markets are showing us and asset prices, and to then take the position that that economy at all is untenable.  You can say that they're less Second, it seems to me that the time MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, will support alternative meeting.  And I want to talk about the question of that question in context a little bit. perhaps less than the Tealbook, but that our policies do affect interest rates doesn't get through to the real effective, but it's very hard to argue that they're ineffective. to stop purchases is down the road.  We haven't achieved a state of play in the labor market that

April 30-May 1, 2013

stability, inflation, don't observe them today.  But, going back to willing to run toward that cliff.  And I'm not going to be those issues arise.  But I don't think we're near the edge of the we would need to do that.  Third, in terms of the costs, looking at financial balance sheet losses, and market functioning-we the fog metaphor that Governor Raskin used and was used in the staff memo, I think we need to be pretty humble about how close we're the bravest one at the table when cliff, so I don't think that's an issue for today.

be appropriate to taper, let me say that, for me, the main reason to at the controls of this LSAP and will calibrate clear basis to react, and it's just not working well enough, going to continue to live in this middle case, where we get choppy progress perfection, we are eventually going to find that we have to pay a big price to get out.  Let connection, that I am reluctant to allow additional aspects of our tapering or force participation in the wake of the March employment report, which all about the participation rate, and that work certainly raises very difficult and troubling that the issue is according to the biggest experts, even a very strong recovery would restore the labor force participation rate to it's just not something that can be added Regarding when it will taper now is to demonstrate that the Committee is up or down, or out in time, based on its reaction to incoming data.  We have trusted the market with this role so far without giving it a in my view.  If we're but not me say, in that stopping test to accrete over time.  In particular, I, too, read the Erceg-Levin paper and a lot of the other papers on labor was questions about the state of the labor market in the United States.  But to say uncertain and murky doesn't do it justice.  It's not clear, whether or not what we think was the trend.  So I think that comfortably to our reaction function, although it is something we need to know about and have in the back of our minds.

April 30-May 1, 2013

would take the next reasonable opportunity to taper.  If the data are bad in June and it's I'm also open to increasing purchases.  As a practical matter, let me say that, in going to be a good idea to surprise the market by a surprise tapering or to say that our public communications will data, including the believe, will probably matter the most for tapering, and that is the extent of assessment, that will mean a restoration of more of the feeling we had at the March meeting, when the market was, I would say, interested but not shocked at I would want to see some improvement in the data. going to get an employment report on Friday and another one before the next I'd want to see a run of data that make us feel more as we felt in March, and then I for tapering. I not plausible to taper, I will support tapering at the next reasonable opportunity.  If the data are really terrible, my view, it's never that the tools have stopped working.  So I hope and expect reinforce that the Committee will adjust purchases in response to incoming one that, ultimately, I progress toward our economic objectives.  I'll argue for reducing purchases at the June meeting if the intermeeting data show that the economy continues to make moderate progress toward our objectives.  And in my the time of the fact that we were talking about tapering. Certainly, we're meeting. think I will be arguing would support the change suggested by Governor Duke, although I, too, was taken by comment about inflation.  And I'm more than happy to bounce-pass that to the I Charlie Evans's Chairman, as Governor Tarullo did.

If the data are there and we're talking I an unmanageable thing in the context of reasonable economic data. meeting, that this is something that can be done.  This is not going to be done in a way that provokes a massive

Governor Duke's language, not because potentially create understand that the pace We've made that pretty us a bunch more clarity in that respect.

as weak as I suspect they will be, then I will not be sufficiently confident market to support dialing down the rate of asset at the June meeting.  But I hope I'm wrong, and I hope that the economy does better asset purchases in June might be appropriate.  The key issue for me in dialing down is on the basis of confidence in the outlook for the labor market.  If we credibility.  If we can justify it, then I think about our an I'm really worried, as we go forward, that market participants could overreact to If the data stay about the prospects for improvement in the labor purchases than expected and the labor market outlook improves.  Then I would think that dialing down the pace of whether we can justify it can't justify it, then we would badly damage our dialing down makes sense for two reasons.  First, it would send a positive signal evaluation of the outlook, which would be well received by market participants and by people in the economy broadly.  And, second, it could potentially help us desensitize the market to such adjustment.

you want to respond to that is to take opportunities to have huge what's going to follow, and that what's going to follow is going to be sensitive end of the day is credibility, and the way I think that I'm not willing to risk the credibility of the FOMC.  And it's not just asset purchases, but it's also credibility about all future commitments on the a couple hundred billion bigger or smaller.  So the credibility is really going to be the key test for me. changes in policy, and I think the way change policy so that people understand that small changes in policy don't consequences for to the data.  But the key issue for me at the about it conceptually is credibility about the basis of the balance sheet being issue thing I want to talk about is something that no one has really talked about yet, here goes.  We talk about the efficacy and costs of the large-scale asset and we act as though the costs and efficacy are independent of us, but there some costs that we do actually have some control over.  One potential cost that I think we as our grows in size.  We can do something about this.  There are steps we could take to In this memo 'Tools to Interest Rates.'

You could demonstrate long before you rates that balance sheet.  And I think that reassuring market participants in this regard, that we can monetary later, even if actual liftoff is very far in the future.  So this is an idea that we should develop further.

I said in the go-round, we have seen improvement since that we remain very far from our objectives, and we have a lot of impending fiscal restraint.  So I remain very comfortable, personally, with the high level of support for alternative B.  As September, and there But of course, it's also true near-term uncertainty, given both some of the recent data readings and the policy accommodation, and I don't see any basis for changing that in this meeting.

It's also important, as many people do whatever we're going to do based on strength, progresswe want to characterize it-and I'm hopeful that the economy will permit that.  But I about the balance sheet and so on Communication issues are very important, as we've talked about.  I made a points at the beginning that, from the staff endogenous response of expectation of purchases have noted, that we exit or taper or however also agree-and I think everyone agrees-that our concerns

In at least some that has more of a random walk character, incoming news.  And so I would encourage whatever, rather than 'taper,' and that's something we are increasing communication and planning for how we might, at some point, bring this program to a close.  I just used the word 'tapering.' following reason:  The word 'tapering,' that once of the discussion today, and going back to comments that President Bullard made a couple of years ago, what we're trying to get at here is a policy i.e., it can go either up or down, depending on the terms like 'vary' or 'adjust' or 'dial' or need to continue to work on.  I do intend, certainly, in my testimony and other contexts, to use this concept-not the word 'taper' but this general concept-and I assume that others will continue to do that as well.

So if we are foreshadow it and take some of the market response to it now.  Judging on the change we made last time, it could very am very concerned about the point that media attention on the softness in inflation and 'the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes,' may economic outlook changes'? MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Mr. Chairman, I President Evans raised-that there's been a lot of speculation that the Committee might be contemplating responding to that.  With that in mind, just to complicate things, instead of I suggest using the phrase 'as the

a CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the problem that President Kocherlakota is identifying is that our language now is focused on the labor market but does mention 'in

April 30-May 1, 2013

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes-that, I think, would be problematic.

And if I could, when I suggested this, I thought and actually said that there the potential that there would be an expectation that we could adjust the pace up.  That may I don't think that's necessarily wrong.  It ought to be an up or down.  So if a revision, things go better, and it comes down and starts to actually don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. MS. DUKE. was very well happen, but that happens-if there's move-I

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  That's a reasonable point.

a lot of concern at this point about further CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The sense of the Committee in the go-round was that, although inflation is low, there didn't seem to be disinflation.  But of course, if that changes, we probably would want to respond to it.

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  That's reasonable.

MR. EVANS.  On the CPI, that and it caused me to look back at the Tealbook forecast.  One thing that I'm entirely the CPI; I've been taking that to be about 0.3 percentage point.

Item 4 is about exit CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Why don't we recommence? strategy principles, and I'll turn to Steve Meyer to introduce the topic.

Publishing these principles, clarifying how the Committee intends to normalize the stance and (1) giving the so and (2) reducing the risk that the Committee's eventual accommodation would come as a big surprise to the public and elements and specific tactical guidelines. MR. MEYER. 5   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The minutes of the June 2011 FOMC meeting include the titled 'Material for and thereby conduct of monetary policy, served two closely related purposes: public confidence that the Federal Reserve will be able to normalize policy smoothly and has a plan for doing steps to reduce policy so cause an outsized market reaction.  In light of those two purposes, the 2011 exit principles include both broad strategic by received from agency securities asset purchase program. a longer the federal funds rate, a step that you released the exit principles. The seventh principle indicates that you might adjust the exit strategy in light of economic and financial developments.  Since June 2011, the economy has been hit shocks emanating from the euro area and from fiscal policy, among others.  Also since June 2011, you decided to reinvest principal into agency MBS rather than into Treasury securities, you conducted the maturity extension program, and you began the flow-based Consequently, the SOMA portfolio is larger, holds more MBS, and has average maturity than we projected in June 2011.  In addition, you adopted thresholdbased forward guidance about your intentions for was not anticipated when

you have suggested that it may be In light of these developments, some of necessary to revise the June 2011 principles.  As background for today's discussion,

your today indicates that you see a need for revisions, the staff will prepare drafts your consideration. the staff prepared memorandums on exit principles, strategy, and tools.  If dialogue for recent Committee meetings, is that many of you see a need to revise principles.  For example, a number of you have suggested an adverse you have reduce you have suggested rather than by selling MBS.  As you've years likely could be sold you have suggested retaining some SOMA portfolio.  And even if you still intend to sell MBS your MBS holdings to zero, you might nonetheless judge, in light of the to sell all to five-year period.  If you want to open the door to any of these exit principles. The first and last of the seven principles seem timeless.  Our sense, based on your remarks during one or more of the other that the Committee might forgo selling MBS, either to avoid the risk of market reaction or to provide some additional monetary stimulus.  Some of noted that ceasing to reinvest principal payments from MBS would, by itself, the Committee's MBS holdings substantially.  Several of reducing the level of reserve balances by selling Treasury securities that will have a relatively short remaining time to maturity noted, Treasury securities that will mature within a few without realizing significant losses.

So, with you to the discussion questions that were distributed last your convenience, I've reproduced them on the second page of the colleagues and I would be happy not only to learn your views, but also Finally, you might think that revisions will be necessary, but not that as background, I'd point week.

questions for Steve or his colleagues?  [No Okay.  Seeing none, let me make a couple of additional remarks. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are there any response]

exit principles, is partly, of course, the change in our policy I was mentioning to President I think that there's also been some significant improvement in our exit tools points out that we have about $700 billion in years by late 2015, and we have remaining maturity of between three and five years.  So could sell, perhaps as an alternative to MBS.  And beyond that, a reverse repo a wide variety of recipients rather than just banks, a point that some people 'deep bench' kind of backup, reserve requirements-both we want to think about. The motivation for looking at stance-the much bigger balance sheet and the thresholds.  But as Fisher earlier, beyond interest in excess reserves and reverse repos and time deposits, which we have been working on for some time.  The staff memo Treasuries that will have a remaining maturity of less than three another $500 billion that will have a that's, obviously, something we there are still further options.  The Vice Chairman talked about the standing of facility, which could help tighten control of interest rates and, by the way, would have the benefit of allowing us to pay have noted before.  Finally, as a very existing rules and emergency provisions-could allow us to immobilize hundreds of billions more dollars of reserves, if that were necessary.  So we do have, I think, better tools, and that's another thing

April 30-May 1, 2013

gone over this.  Among the substance issues, linking are the key elements that we would want to try to get some you about.  There are also longer-run issues, including whether to keep a small conclusions on that. minutes.  We could do a could be of greater or we could use other methods.  If we agree on some basic principles, we could and testimony, et cetera.  So there are a variety of different of them have different tactical implications for As we talk about these issues today, we have substance issues, and we have communications issues.  Steve has already the exit steps to the threshold guidance, talking about sales of Treasuries and MBS, and, perhaps, commenting on additional tools information from amount of MBS in the long run and what our operating procedures will be in the long run. Although, certainly, we're welcome to discuss those issues, it's a future Committee that will make those final determinations, and I don't think we have to come to any There are also communications issues, and you should please pay attention to those.  We could do a formal statement like last time, which we released through the formal statement released through some other mechanism.  The statement lesser detail.  Or disseminate them through speeches ways to communicate this information, and some policy communication as well.

wanted to put all of those things on the table and invite comment.  Depending on what you something to load on, if you wish, in June, or we for guidance from you on that issue.  So let me will start with the Vice Chairman. I we hear today, we could, of course, bring could have further discussions.  We're waiting begin a go-round, and I

Thank you.  I think it makes sense to revise the exit that a no longer expect agency MBS sales, even though that's what's in our VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. principles and make that known sooner rather than later, because, clearly, what we have in place today is no longer operative.  This can be seen in the primary dealer survey, which shows majority of respondents

April 30-May 1, 2013

reinforced by the discussion in the March FOMC an upward spike in yields. commit to the timing sequence of normalization-ending reinvestment, for examplerate to raise short-term rates as soon as that threshold is reached?  It makes sense to me to revise the exit principles sooner rather than later because people will I would hope we could get it done at the June meeting.  That goal-aspirational. exit principles.  And that view, of course, was minutes about how not selling agency MBS could mitigate the risk of The exit principles also don't seem sensible to me, given the introduction of the thresholds.  How can we when we don't know when we'll reach the thresholds or, in the case of the unemployment threshold, whether we'll want also soon assume that this is in train.  If they haven't figured that out already, the minutes to this meeting will make that clear. would be ideal because that would be relatively soon, and the Chairman would have the opportunity to discuss it in the press conference.  So that's a approach, I think the exit principles should be recast in two broad ways. they should be less about tactics and more about principles.  The focus should be on the minimizing disruption of market function and risks to financial on the precise ordering in the way each tool will be used.  We should on how we can best use our tools to achieve our objectives.  In June that's really what the exit principles at that In terms of what First, outcome we seek-smooth exit; stability-rather than maintain some flexibility 2011, when we put forward this first set of exit principles, it was a different environment.  Our balance sheet was smaller.  Exit was anticipated to be relatively near at hand compared with today, and we had a different objective.  We were trying to reassure people that we weren't going to dump a lot of assets into the market, and time were trying to address.

I think we should emphasize how we plan to exit in a way maintains effective monetary control, but also minimizes market-functioning and In terms of the exit principles, that not only

April 30-May 1, 2013

as we have the tools effectively, even with an enlarged balance sheet, which I I want to separate these two issues because I don't want commitments about ability to exit in a way consistent with our nearI don't want to have these artificial constraints that we've created for ourselves. I gain today by constraining myself to a particular balance sheet or structure in the future. I don't see the connection between the longer-term balance sheet We're going to learn a lot about our monetary policy regime as we normalize interest from doing before determining what the longer-term financial stability risks.  I would put the focus on that rather than on how the balance sheet will evolve over the longer term.  I think that these issues are separable as long in place to conduct monetary policy think we do.  And the longer-term balance sheet to constrain our term objectives. Also, I'm not sure what the longer-term balance sheet should look like, and so I don't understand what The only potential benefit of doing so, of putting these balance sheet constraints in place, would be if that made exit easier, but and exit. rates.  So, to me, it makes sense to learn balance sheet should look like.

or short-term Treasuries, I would favor announcing that we are fully you the option of selling them later, at some future date, if you want. four clear benefits:  It sharp rise in long-term rates, it adds a bit of additional accommodation for longer, and it eliminates the risk of capital remittances.  So I think this straightforward. In terms of sales of MBS have no plans to sell agency MBS in the foreseeable future, at least until interest rates normalized.  That gives Retaining agency MBS, as our discussion around the table has shown, has eliminates the risk that such sales might pose to market functioning, it reduces the risk to financial stability from a by keeping the agency MBS on our balance sheet losses from sales that could depress our Treasury pre-commit to this or rule it out.  I In terms of short-dated Treasury sales, I wouldn't think we can defer this decision.  I don't think it's something that market participants are worried

April 30-May 1, 2013

going to want to start Treasuries we'll hold don't know how well the other tools will work in controlling short-term actually will be to drain reserves through asset sales.  We of those interest rates perspective at least, it seems too soon to whether we'll actually want to undertake such sales in the in which we find ourselves a few years out in the future. about or focusing on now.  Most important, we don't know when we're raising short-term rates.  We don't know, therefore, how much short-dated at that point in time.  We rates-in other words, how important it also don't know what interest rates will be doing then and what the impact will be on the path of our remittances.  So, from my commit to such sales when it's unclear particular circumstances a much scaled-back version of the exit principles.  These would focus attention to minimizing market-functioning and financial stability risks.  And, finally, anticipate that the short-term interest rates, such as the federal funds rate, are here is, I want to derate because we might want to shift to a different floor RRP rate that I was talking about a little bit earlier, if Another advantage of the is, if that works, it solves some of the potential governance issues because that would To sum up, I favor on our goals of using our tools in a way to foster our dual mandate objectives and that would give some I'd note that we anticipated to be the primary tool of monetary policy.  But the point emphasize the primacy of the federal funds short-term rate instrument-say, the that turns out to be a very effective tool to control short-term rates. floor RRP clearly be in the province of the FOMC, unlike the interest on excess reserves.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

ask the Vice Chairman to clarify your view on thresholds and CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard-a two-handed intervention. MR. BULLARD.  Could I how that intersects with this?  I didn't quite get what you said.

April 30-May 1, 2013

a threshold that expected forward inflation.  We don't know when we're going actually going to act once we hit that about how you're going to stop reinvestment going to do liftoff. as though thresholds create a lot of confusion.  When should we stop reinvesting when we going to increase?  I don't understand how think the thresholds make the timing issue a little bit confusing to me. aren't concerned about that. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Well, the issue on thresholds is, we have states this unemployment rate and to hit that threshold, and then we don't know if we're threshold or someplace in the future.  So, talking early-I don't know how to link that up with the timing of when I'm actually I feel don't know when short-term interest rates are actually the sequencing works.  I And maybe other people

MR. BULLARD.  I took the thresholds to apply to the interest rate side of our policy, and so it was a commitment on coming off the zero bound, but not on other actions that we might take.

time between when we were going to end the reinvestment and-X months it was 6 to 12 months afterward.  Now, it's very I'm deciding to end the reinvestment, how do I know how going to raise short-term rates, given the thresholds? VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Well, the original exit principles, I think, envisioned a very fixed period of later-when we were going to start to raise short-term interest rates.  Maybe it wasn't completely fixed, but it was pretty well understood that difficult to make that linkage; today, if that links up to when I'm actually decision that the Committee is making? getting close to these, or maybe you're a bit beyond, and then you make a policy MR. BULLARD.  Wouldn't that just be a policy You're decision.

I don't know.  Other people may not be as concerned I am.  I just think it creates a lack of crispness to the current set of exit principles. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. about this as

April 30-May 1, 2013

I prefer the word 'complicated' over 'confused.' MR. EVANS.

It's confusing to me.  It may not VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes-'complicated.' be confusing to others, but it's confusing to me.

Thank you. MR. BULLARD.  Okay.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Duke.

I was going to get to go first in the last round. MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, let me apologize for jumping the line twice.  I didn't realize you exerted a great leadership role last time. MR. FISHER.  But

I did want to go early in this one, and I think it's actually helpful to clear what my preferences are for our balance sheet size, but, in thinking you make plans for the case in which things just don't go the you hope that they'll go.  So I want to skip the questions that we were asked to address, and I want to begin by recognizing that our exit principles are out of agree that we should acknowledge this formally-but I'd be very wary of including MS. DUKE.  But follow Vice Chairman Dudley.  I'm now back in the very comfortable position of agreeing with him completely and have some thoughts that dovetail with the suggestions that he's making. I've made it pretty strategically, I think it requires that way discuss a broader view of exit that, I believe, would accommodate a much larger balance sheet than we currently expect. date-and I any specificity in whatever principles we choose to replace them.

remember from the earlier round that markets were quick to assume that we were because we were discussing exit.  So I wonder if it might not be possible exit principles as a way to mitigate concerns about the cost of a larger a discussion of ways to increase accommodation rather than remove it.  In current statement to be out of date, it might be helpful to acknowledge that the I preparing to exit simply to position our review of balance sheet and declaring the

But, ideally, the up an expectation for a continuous review that identifies options but strategy or sequence until we're actually considering an exit.  If we can as though we're going to have before we return to using a fed funds target to monetary conditions that don't depend so balance sheet or draining reserves, because, as the total amount of grow, we could reach the point where it would be more effective to reserves to regain control of the fed balance sheet, and then turning to a new framework. appropriate use and sequencing of exit tools will our balance sheet, as well as market conditions at that we'll pursue our objectives with a sensitivity principles would also set doesn't settle on any position ourselves in such a way, then I think it would be appropriate to use the roughly two years that it looks think about alternative frameworks for managing heavily on shrinking the reserves continues to transition directly to a new framework, rather than draining funds rate, shrinking the managing short-term rates through the federal funds rate by fed funds market today is no longer an active interbank market.  It's composed of GSEs, which can't earn interest on reserves, selling to a handful of IOER must be FDIC insurance costs.  And once we offer the GSEs the reduce or abandon their participation in the fed I believe that the idea of adjusting the supply and demand for reserves is an outdated notion in the context of our current balance sheet.

fed funds market as either borrowers or lenders.  As deposit growth has Banks traditionally use the federal funds market as a tool to manage liquidity.  It seems to me that it'll take a very long time and a very low level of excess reserves before banks have the incentive to return to the

April 30-May 1, 2013

reduced.  The tradeoff here is that, as excess reserves become minimal, the far exceeded opportunities to invest additional deposits, banks have steadily reduced their nondeposit liabilities, including fed funds borrowed.  And since we began paying interest on a large quantity of reserves, parking short-term reserves with us has become preferable to lending in the fed funds market.  Banks will return to lending to each other only if the opportunity to lend to us is significantly IOER becomes somewhat less relevant for borrowing and investing decisions.

being driven by any notion of the supply and demand driven entirely by our need for the authority Even though reserves aren't The level of reserves is no longer necessary to achieve a short-term rate goal.  The level of reserves is being need to fund asset purchases.  When we testified at the Congress about our to pay interest on reserves, we made three points:  that we no longer viewed the fractional reserve system as an important tool of monetary policy; that being forced to hold uncompensated reserves represented a tax on the banking system; and that banks had developed methods, such as sweep systems, to avoid the tax by minimizing their reserves. particularly useful to us in controlling the money supply, they're costly to administer both for us and for the banks, and they unnecessarily complicate bank deposit product offerings.

in the fractional reserve system anymore, raising reserve to bring supply and demand for reserves back into balance.  We even authority to raise reserve requirements to very high levels.  But I think it's reserve were at lower levels, and raising reserve requirements has historically a demand management tool, we should be mindful of the interaction with other Even if we don't believe requirements is one way have emergency unrealistic to assume that the banks will be any less creative at avoiding even higher requirements than they signaled a sharp tightening of policy.  Moreover, if we do consider modifying reserve requirements as regulatory requirements.  For example, I would expect required reserves to be subtracted from

April 30-May 1, 2013

So, increasing reserve requirements to create to meet those reserve requirements would again subtract from liquidity, going to keep a large amount of reserves taking up be able to serve as an addition, rather than a don't crowd out lending to private borrowers. liquid assets in calculating available liquidity. demand for reserves would also reduce bank liquidity and, potentially, their willingness to lend. Overnight borrowing thereby creating a double debt.  If we're space on bank balance sheets, they should at least subtraction, from liquidity.  And we might want to exclude them from any regulatory leverage requirement so that they reserves, that leaves us with reducing supply to very instruments to fund it.  I can't see much excess reserves and term deposits as incentivizing banks to reengage in that that tool effectively restarts the fed funds market as our primary draining can do and the speed with which we can do it are heavily dependent on even before it brought the level of reserves down affect the fed funds rate.  Memos refer to $1.9 trillion in reserves, using $1.9 trillion becomes $2Â½ trillion under current market 'A trillion here, a trillion there, and pretty soon you're talking real you tell me, I did look up to find out who said that, and it turns out that Dirksen good quote that he let people think that he did. If we can't increase the demand for low levels as our key tool, which means draining reserves.  And draining reserves means shrinking our balance sheet or finding alternative differentiation between the fed funds market.  So I'm not confident or helps regain control of the fed funds rate, which leaves reverse repos tool and funding source.  Whether we use reverse repos or term deposits, it seems to me that the amount of draining we the level of short-term interest rates that we're willing to accept.  Any draining operation would likely have a strong effect on short-term rates to the level necessary to the staff baseline forecast.  That expectations, and, as they say, money.'  Before never actually said it, but he thought it was such a

I think it's possible, even likely, that we ultimately quite well using repos and reverse repos, along with the IOER.  If that's would be well served by transitioning to discussing policy in those Once we we can then manage regime rather than draining reserves and growth through reverse repos as an alternative to adding reserves.

In the end, it might be smoother to transition directly to such a reducing the balance sheet first.  At some point, we might even want to consider funding additional balance sheet guess that would be sort that all of this would be a communications challenge, and I understand that the governance questions.  But a bumpy exit would be an challenge and a threat to confidence in our ability to control the as a key policy endeavor in any case.  And have to solve as much as two years we need to begin, it seems reasonable to me that we could find some time in there to think I know relative prominence of the IOER raises even greater communications exit.  I don't think there's any question about the need to rely on the IOER instrument.  So, solving the governance question seems a worthwhile importantly, none of these obstacles seem so great that they justify not thinking creatively about the best framework for monetary policy in the future.  I'm not suggesting that we this issue before we revise our exit strategy principles, but if we do have before about this, and that we could leave a place for it in our revised exit principles.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.

you, Mr. Chairman.  In some respects, I guess I'll continue the introduced, but I'm dialing up the skepticism a bit on the utility of this Back in 2011, I recall having some concerns about an extended discussion of exit we were were actually thinking about exiting-something that turns out to have for ourselves exit principles at anything but the high level earlier.  The question I'd ask, then, is:  What are we going to get out of MR. TARULLO.  Thank themes that Bill and Betsy enterprise. principles for just the reason that Betsy alluded to a moment ago, which was communicating that we been premature at best.  In retrospect, there was another problem that we created precisely by putting these things out, which is, now they seem outmoded and thus, I think, call into question the wisdom of trying to reformulate that Bill was alluding to this enterprise?

that the previously also Ironically, what that reflects is the need to reverse a principle that couple of years ago, which reinforces the caution about stating too many things in I wonder whether there's much usefulness to be gotten out of this beyond a restatement close to a set of platitudes.  There's nothing wrong with platitudes, but 'Well, we're going to do things so as to avoid financial instability'-I'm not sure it amount, except maybe just restating to ourselves what we think we're I don't know that it provides much reassurance to people in the world that going to be able to exit smoothly. Now, it seems to me that there's one thing that we really do-or at least I really dowant to accomplish, and Bill mentioned this as well, which is making clear stated intention to sell MBS is no longer operative.  And I do think it's not only useful, but important, to get that idea out. we stated a advance. of things in a way that's saying, contributes an enormous going to do.  But we're

April 30-May 1, 2013

need anything else right now.  Even the issue of how the things could probably be left for later, although my instinct is to agree with It might be desirable to have a more of operative principles, but I'm, frankly, not even sure of that, because it people reading into some of the changes way more than what I don't think that we really thresholds change Bill that it does require some further statement. contemporary statement may just invite the world to compare the last statement with the new one and, as seems often to be the case in such instances, not only to draw attention to the fact that we've changed our minds, but also to elicit a bunch of we may have intended.

The first-it must very much detail in the exit strategy that will later encounter the second is until after policy normalization or whether reliance on the federal funds rate to some other mechanism. years, but I If we be obvious by now-is having same kinds of problems that we're now seeing with the 2011 exit principles.  And the getting into a prolonged discussion in an effort to develop statements around longer-term issues, such as whether we should continue to hold MBS we're going to move from primary As Betsy said, there are a lot of things to be talked about over the next couple of don't think we need to even begin to engage in that discussion in order to achieve what needs to be achieved now.

I think something like what Narayana has enough sentiment for going down that route, I is going to look like after normalization, or if we start getting So if we are going to restate principles, suggested is the sensible approach.  If there's certainly wouldn't be opposed to it.  But if we start getting bogged down in issues of principle, such as what the balance sheet tempted to put in too much detail, then my suggestion would be that we just step back, identify

And for that reason-this is a minor point-to discourage anticipation that may want to employ a version of the formal wording that was in the and conduct of monetary policy,' if MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Before I'll make just a couple of preliminary comments.  I think we should be careful in any communication to decouple discussion of ultimate exit from adjustment of the current program.  There is already and large balance sheet environment with phasing out or adjusting the staff noted two webinars chance for real exit is imminent, we minutes back in 2011, which was 'normalizing the stance the Committee decides to produce something or publicize something on what we're calling exit.

general topic, I find myself in agreement with Vice Dudley and others.  I would suggest that, if we go forward, a clear distinction be made years away.  Much could change between now and then. even further out in the future On the questions themselves and the Chairman between guiding principles and thinking about tactical implementation.  The projections of many of us show the start date two and a half Decisions on many of the specifics of tactical implementation are and will involve a learning curve.

The only one that really is in play, it Treasury-only SOMA I don't think the six principles-and here I am referring to the paraphrased principles on pages 2 and 3 of the staff memo-which 2011 require much updating.  They seems to me, is the principle related to whether we will return to a

April 30-May 1, 2013

having guiding principle, that the Treasury portfolio is intended to be structure than it is now.  If that concern is a balanced maturity structure of portfolio.  For my own part, I'm not as concerned as some may be about the prospect of some agency debt or MBS in the SOMA portfolio for a long period of time.  However, I do think it should be stressed, as a matter of more diversified or balanced in terms of maturity addressed, the Committee might consider something that says, 'The Committee anticipates return over time to a SOMA portfolio that consists primarily of Treasury securities.'

I said a need to pre-commit to just reference the earlier tactical points and say, 'They applicable and will be revised as the 6Â½ percent unemployment rate threshold As regards the tactical steps that were articulated in the principles in 2011, as earlier, I'm reluctant to get in the weeds again at this juncture.

The have to be revised, but far ahead.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.

Chairman laid well, and Governor Duke raised some key issues for us to be thinking years.  So I'll try to be brief in what I have to say. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I thought the Vice out the relevant issues very about over the next couple of

April 30-May 1, 2013

I think the work done by the staff here in D.C. and by the staff around the System that the policy rule that governs exit has a big effect on current communication about our exit strategy is an important stimulus that we will be providing over the next year or two. First, has emphasized repeatedly outcomes.  This means that credible policy tool for the serious conversation about the likely will shape the amount of

Committee.  Second-and relatedly, in my view-we need to begin to have a goals of policy during exit.  The goals of policy during exit communicate that we plan to keep inflation at 2 percent or a ceiling during that time-then we accommodation rapidly.  That pushes down on current stimulus.  If we are Yellen mentioned-exit forms of communication about exit.  This means from providing as much accommodation as the Specifically, after deciding this, if we under during the exit process-that is, we view our target as will be withdrawing willing to allow the medium-term inflation outlook to rise as high as 2Â½ percent, then exit will be slow.  In particular, given how flat the Phillips curve is-as Governor will be very slow, and people will be more willing to spend now as a result.  Finally, our current exit principles constrain us from using many that our current exit principles are restricting us economy needs.

question 1.  I think the answer to about exit is one of our key policy tools, and we're not really able to at this stage because of the existing principles.  For example, if we wanted to currently plan to hold all assets until maturity, we can't do that under the changed. Let me turn to the questions.  I'll really only answer question 1 is, 'Yes, we need to change the principles as soon as possible,' because our ability to communicate effectively use it effectively communicate that we current principles.  So they have to be a good idea to put the principles out in the minutes, as we had before.  As President It's Lockhart suggested, I would title them something like 'Long-Run Normalization of Monetary

April 30-May 1, 2013

run-or whatever you want to use.  I think that we just want to be very high level in terms of what we want circulated a memo from the I thought took a very nice approach to describing the relevant principles. certainly not wedded to any specific language, and I don't want to get into a speech about I do believe that the draft that my staff prepared really had the appropriate Policy,' something along those lines, to try to emphasize that it's very long terms to communicate.  We want to figure out what's appropriate along those lines, and I think the previous principles ended up being overly specific.  On Monday, I Minneapolis staff that I'm words, et cetera.  But level of detail.

It's going to about our goals during the of our exit strategy principles disrupts that correct this problem. To sum up, I think this is an important thing to be Mr. be especially important for us to be able to communicate credibly normalization process, and the current specificity communication.  And we need to get around to revising those principles as soon as possible.  If it can be done in June, that would be great-to a question for some of the speakers already, which of principles that we're trying to achieve, does this fit into that?  And if so, how?  Or is that communicated in CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I have is, if we have a very high-level document particular issue of not selling MBS some separate way?  Maybe President Kocherlakota will answer the question.

I think that's a that the Committee wanted to communicate-that it was currently anticipating not principles.  The MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I'll answer the question for myself, obviously. policy move that should be undertaken by the Committee and put into the statement.  If that was something selling MBS-that could be put into the statement; I wouldn't put it in the

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That's helpful.  Okay.  President Williams.

get asked this question I speak publicly.  I think we've actually done a pretty good job, with I'll talk about that some more.  But this is an incredibly important a plan, we've thought confidence in that plan.  I agree with the Vice Chairman that reinforce that message that we've thought hard about this, we've come going forward.  I think we're change it.  I actually believe that it's been very valuable, and I know there are a lot of MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'd like to thank the staff for the very helpful memos on this very important topic, and I'll just mention that I about our exit every time our exit principles from 2011, of laying out the high-level principles.  In my view, we probably got into too many details. thing we've done in terms of communicating to the public that we do have hard about the plan, and we have we need to update it and up with tools, and we can control the stance of monetary policy kicking ourselves here a little bit too much about how the exit strategy wasn't perfect and now we have to political questions out there, too.  Does the Fed have an exit strategy?  Again, it's an important thing we've done, and we do need to update it.

already and specific tactics.  As I mentioned back in many people have already mentioned, the general principles from our June remain appropriate today.  But our balance sheet is now much larger than it guidelines to give us more flexibility to soundly The memos made an important distinction-which numerous people have mentioned-and that's between broad principles March, and as statement generally was back then, more tilted toward longer-duration Treasuries and MBS.  So, in light of these changes, we need to adjust our tactical implement those broad principles.  I continue to support the general principles of eventually

April 30-May 1, 2013

choose to conduct, will depend on economic conditions and can closer to the time of funds rate liftoff. moving back to a Treasuries-only SOMA portfolio and of significantly reducing bank reserves to a level consistent with conducting monetary policy.  However, the specific tactical details about the pace of balance sheet renormalization provided in our June 2011 statement clearly are no longer appropriate.  Decisions about the rate of balance sheet normalization, including the pace of any asset sales that we may wait until we're

I'd make three changes I would sentence about the allocation of credit across. a false impression that we're eager to rid ourselves of these assets as soon with the staff memo's suggestion to combine the first two tactical tools into a single initial-steps guideline.  The that we'd have the flexibility to pursue any combination of these Again, I think we explain the principles, or the tools we have, what some qualifications and flexibility to the last tactic, the one about sales of and Treasury securities.'  'Such gradual and steady pace.'  I would also delete the explicit balance sheet Therefore, to maximize our flexibility in implementing our exit, to the proposed exit strategy principles and tactics that are in the staff memo.  First, increase the flexibility in principle 4, the one about returning to a Treasuries-only portfolio over time, by leaving out the rationale at the end of the This sentence leaves as practicable.  Second, I agree guidelines into one.  That would lump together the tactics of ending reinvestment, modifying our forward guidance, and deploying reserve-draining advantage of this approach is tactics when the time comes. we're trying to accomplish, but we don't get into the specifics of how we're going to do that. Third, I would add agency securities, so that it says, 'Part of normalizing the SOMA could include sales of agency and Treasury securities'-so, 'could include sales of agency sales, if they occur, would be at a three- to five-year and two- to three-year time horizons for MBS sales and

Given that our current should not delay putting a mistake to permanently keep MBS securities in the SOMA proven a powerful tool we must be judicious in deploying it in the future.  In thinking about this, reminded of a scene from one of the all-time great movies.  I'm speaking, of course, of from the Bilbo to go, he keeps flipping the ring back into his pocket.  It keeps tempting him.  Like the hobbits in Finally, it would be portfolio just to maintain expertise at the Desk.  Our MBS purchases have during this episode, but I'm The Lord of the Rings:  The Fellowship of the Ring. The hobbit Bilbo is about to journey shire and leave behind the ring of power.  Yet when it comes time for unconsciously The Lord of the Rings, we must overcome the temptation of the ring of power.  So when the time comes, we should let it go.  [Laughter]

At one a T-bills-only strategy.  This strategy minimizes interest rate risk but, in weighted toward long-term debt, possibly Treasury bonds, incurring little interest rate want to distort holdings by the public through our holding securities in We need to significantly a broader discussion of the appropriate steady-state composition of our balance sheet at some point.  We macroeconomic objective.  We need to have a general discussion of whether there are circumstances under which this may be true when we are no longer extreme, we could adopt effect, causes the public to hold a portfolio more resulting in larger term premiums.  At the other extreme, we might hold T-bills, and MBS in the same proportion as the securities that are outstanding.  In this way, our holdings reflect what is available to the public at large, and we would not seek to distort the relative supplies that would otherwise be available to the public.  This passive holdings policy would recognize that we are generally holding investments to maturity and risk, and that we do not different proportions than the portfolio of securities outstanding.

could be several reasons why we'd consider something in between these two Treasury bonds, and Treasury bills.  Should we want to buy or sell in these future, the infrastructure would still be up and running.  A second would be that one rates, which would require more holdings of each asset class.  A third MBS is that we may want to have an option of macroprudential There options.  One is based on operational risk management, which would argue for at least some activity in MBS, areas in the tool may not be the optimal tool for all occasions, as the zero lower bound has highlighted. Thus, we may want to have a diversified set of policy tools, rather than limiting ourselves to only movements in overnight reason to hold long-term Treasury securities and using the SOMA portfolio for macroprudential monetary policy as well as

or sell example, we might want to signal an undesirable the residential real estate market by selling MBS securities outright or by ability to significantly alter mortgage rates, which would require supervisory policy.  We might choose this option if we view macroprudential supervisory tools, such as capital ratios, to be much like fiscal policy:  time-consuming to implement and difficult to set without political interference.  Thus, we might want to preserve the option to buy securities for macroprudential purposes.  For overheating in swapping MBS for Treasury securities.  The size of our holdings of MBS might be determined by whether we wish to emphasize the signaling role of such an intervention, which might imply smaller holdings, or the significant holdings.

April 30-May 1, 2013

Presidents Lockhart and Williams, I MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like think the current exit strategy principles have served us well in public discussion, assuring people that we've thought about the way out and have some confidence in our ability to execute on it.

close to it, to any holding MBS longer or selling them less rapidly.  These options, to me, foray into the MBS market is a temporary, going to do with the balance sheet during our exit I'd see this current holdings of MBS as abnormal and unusual and away from.  It would be a mistake to take a step in the direction of an indefinite presence in the MBS market with and the Fed, which declared that government authorities.  I also think exit principles, we'd owe people an explanation about that as well. Personally, I'd prefer the current principles, or something very alternatives that have us represent a break from the premise that our emergency measure.  We refer to what we're as normalization, which implies that where we've been, where we are, is abnormal. as a move away from treating the something we should get institutionalizing our operation in the MBS market.  If we went down that road, though, we would owe the public an explanation reconciling the March 23, 2009, joint statement of the Treasury decisions to influence the allocation of credit are the province of fiscal that if we drop the reference to credit allocation that President Williams cited that's in our current rationale you proposed at the end of our last exchange, Mr. Chairman, as consequences in the presence going to be higher than they otherwise would be if we're lowering MBS spreads, or have if we had bought all Treasuries.  So other borrowers are you have in mind or I took the saying that tilting interest rate spreads toward MBS has no adverse of underutilized or unutilized resources in society.  But, clearly, other nonmortgage interest rate spreads are will fall by less than they would going to expand their borrowing by less.  Maybe there's some other model

April 30-May 1, 2013

yields a different conclusion.  I'm willing to discuss it.  But even if you is still a problem because there's no caveat or escape clause in there about some other approach that do, the joint statement underutilized or unutilized resources.  We still owe people an explanation, in my view.

continue to hold MBS in order to maintain the that we are capable of deciding whether we need to operate in the MBS market.  This to every market in the universe, I'd point out.  And the idea that you without our intervention is below some Gale, chapter 9, for example, is a version of that that I've heard Let me just comment on the idea that we analytical expertise to understand those markets, which is hard to take seriously.  The logic seems to be that we need to operate continually in MBS markets in order to understand MBS markets so logic would seem to apply need to operate in a market to understand or to intervene in it conflicts with the premise underlying our intervention, which is based on these models where it's common knowledge to everyone in the model that the price of the security fundamental value.  Allen and cited.

also hard to take seriously the idea that we should revise exit principles because going to follow them.  If we think we want to follow them, and let them know, and correct their misapprehensions.  We could easily and guide their expectations toward something sensible. It's dealers we survey don't think we're let's declare it to people reaffirm the principles where we're going to head with the balance sheet in the going to get back to Treasuries only or It's become something that we've become to normal sometime soon.  I think that we need to MBS holdings.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The broader picture here is that long run is a highly consequential issue for us.  Are we not?  This all started as an emergency expedient. numb to, inured to, and accustomed to and are treating as normal.

I sense that the memo downplayed the idea that promises of future I would have rewritten that sentence to say, are made credible.'  And I would like us to enhancing the credibility of forward guidance, getting at, if, indeed, we feel that reached some kind of limit as to potential asset purchases and the infringement on our I stress 'minor' because I thought that that was good memo-was, I was looking for a crisper decision-tree aspect of it.  The section was a little bit less crisp than decision trees I'm used to, and I made the mistake the movie going back to the memo, and I sensed it had the the way, for those who don't know what I'm a movie fan, go on Google, scroll down to 'Memorable Movie Death #3,' and it's Vizzini versus Westley from MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, I do want to thank the staff for their memos, and I was particularly intrigued by the memo on the pace of asset very well reasoned. answering the accommodation can substitute for asset purchases, and I'll quote a sentence:  'Such promises may not be very effective substitutes for the monetary stimulus resulting from asset purchases, which are tangible and arguably more credible.' 'Such promises will be effective only insofar as they spend some time thinking about mechanisms for perhaps along the lines of what President Kocherlakota was we've balance sheet.  The second minor criticism-and an exceptionally reasons that evening of watching The Princess Bride, in which Vizzini the Sicilian matches wits with Westley.  After watching that, I was same kind of tone.  This is very difficult stuff.  By talking about, being greatest all-time scenes, The Princess Bride .

get asked at What's your exit plan?  And I sort of bop are several tools that are available, and that I think the Now, to the serious stuff-the four questions.  Like President Williams, I every single speech, do you have exit principles? around the question.  I point out that there

April 30-May 1, 2013

a very sophisticated game of chess, and that we have if we don't complicate exit or might steer us toward a can or specific, that will you point out, and our expanded toolbox.  We may be able to reach an important thing to discuss. important thing is that we are playing thought through our next moves.  I do think it's very important that we do think through our next moves.  Actions, once taken, cannot easily be reversed, especially these nonstandard monetary policy actions that we've taken.  And I don't think we can properly weigh their costs keep in mind how our actions may eventually monetary policy that is far down on our list of preferences.  So I welcome this discussion.  I think we should share our thinking.  We should air our differences now in the hope that we reach some consensus on a long-term framework and exit principles, vague help guide our more immediate decisions, particularly in light of the reality of-as Mr. Chairman-our balance sheet consensus on this subject or not, but it's want to take the last three questions together-questions 2, 3, and 4.  The Federal I understand it, gives the Federal Open Market Committee authority only over System Open Market Account.  And in the past, the Committee a floor system, however, the link the funds rate, and I'd like to see us commit to returning to a framework in which the adjustments to reserves are used to keep the funds rate near a target that's strictly above the and strictly below the discount rate.  The only difference between then and now is that IOER was zero, and since 2008, it's been positive.  I realize that the transition to some time, given the size of our balance sheet.  Incidentally, I count the I Reserve Act, as the size and composition of the has used this authority to manipulate the funds rate.  Under between the balance sheet and the funds rate is broken.  The IOER determines marginal changes in the quantity of reserves have, perhaps, minimal effects on short-term interest rates. the quantity of IOER rate before 2008, the this framework will take

April 30-May 1, 2013

as one of the costs of further balance sheet extra time needed to return to this framework expansion.

President Lacker, I would like to see us commit to returning to an all-Treasury I feel the same as he does about MBS purchases; they put us in the credit amount of efficacy.  That's why I voted for them.  But we need to keep in mind different expertise to for a different more staff and some bureaucratic inertia-we talked about this before, coming to accept this as a commonly used tool.  I mortgage-backed securities from our portfolio will take time, given the MBS from our costs of the MBS purchases. Like balance sheet. allocation business.  I would argue-and I argued for this at the beginning-that initially, they had an enormous that, if we keep going down this path, it is dangerous.  Now, they're a bit of a devil's bargain. They're of long duration, they trade in an illiquid market, and MBS purchases are particularly difficult to undo.  They have another downside, and that is that they require buy and manage.  And again, with all due respect to our operators, they call infrastructure, meaning Simon.  So I would be careful here in terms of realize that eliminating size of our holdings, but again, I count that extra time needed to eliminate portfolio as one of the guide near-term policy.  I noted carefully Governor Tarullo's comments, and those of others that followed, about specificity.  If greater would note that these commitments suggest actions, which I've mentioned before.  That is, as we and toward normalization of the balance sheet, first, I would stop adding to would put the proceedings from maturing MBS into Treasuries, stop adding to net Treasury holdings. Making two broad, long-term commitments, to me, is the most important step we can take to clarify our exit strategy and and his predecessors' specificity is desired-that is, if it is desired-then I the following sequence of balance sheet move toward liftoff our MBS holdings.  Second, I allowing MBS holdings to shrink.  Third, I would also

April 30-May 1, 2013

mature.  And, fifth-and this, again, is a As I said earlier, this actions that I suggested at our previous meeting.  The earlier we begin Rate increases could begin coincident with the fourth step, as they mature or anytime thereafter.  I see no compelling out combining steps to Fourth, I would allow Treasuries to run off as they sequence over time, at least having it in our own mind-I would sell the securities from the SOMA portfolio, starting with those securities that are closest to maturity. is the same sequence of these steps relative to when we begin raising short-term interest rates, the smaller are both likely capital losses and interest costs. which is allowing Treasuries to run off reason to be more specific than that on their timing.  And I would not rule accelerate normalization.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Evans.

Death #3,' community college job fair-it might be nice if the transcripts website [laughter] so that future historians can make the associations. MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, I'd like to start with a proposal:  With all of the cultural references that have been made today-movies, The Lord of the Rings, 'Memorable Movie could reflect a link to the relevant proper

Levity aside, I agree with comments like those of Presidents Williams, 2011 exit principles statement has really served us who goes out and talks and takes questions, there have been many times 'Have you And it's very useful to say, 'Yes, the June 2011 minutes have that, and well.  Now, having said that, I still think that years away, and we should be careful not to impede the effectiveness of our current a sufficient amount of accommodation to reduce the All right. Lockhart, and Lacker.  I think that the June quite well.  For anybody when somebody stands up and acts as if no one has ever thought of this before: thought about exiting?' we expect to do that.'  So they have served us very exit is a few policy, which I take to be, provide

April 30-May 1, 2013

possible.  There is a tension, as many have We need to deal with that.  So I personally am in no real hurry full revision to our exit principles.  But that said, I do take the point that it's a minimalist adjustments to the principles that we have in place, and most a substantially larger balance sheet than what we did unemployment rate below 6Â½ percent as soon as noted already, in our communications discussing our current short-term accommodation and, ultimately, longer-term restraint. to announce a good idea to make some of those simply reflect the reality of contemplate in June 2011.

I definitely think that yearsas is conveying the idea to a Treasuries-only we should reserve as In some sense, I think that one way to just in a statement from the Chairman or in a paragraph in the we could label something 'Exit Principles, version 2.0,' but many people have good recommendations already about how to handle that, I'm not going to get Regarding the things that the staff is looking for to tabulate, somehow mentioning that normalization is likely to take longer than three to five whether we're specific about that or we just take it out-is important that we'll be in no hurry to unload our MBS holdings to get back too quickly SOMA account.  Ultimately, Treasuries-only is the right place to head, but much flexibility on the tactics of that as seems reasonable. handle this might possibly be minutes.  I don't know.  I suppose I'm a little concerned about drawing too much attention to it.  And because made some very into that detail too much.

I took to be, how do policy developments since June 2011 I was mentioning during the Vice Chairman's comments, it is very complicated reinforce the threshold concept of what our The second set of questions factor in?  As how the thresholds interact with the size of our balance sheet and what we're going to do with it. I think that it's very important for us to continually policy is.  Our forward guidance-it's not a trigger; it's a threshold.  And that will come into

April 30-May 1, 2013

as we contemplate any reserve draining.  As the unemployment rate gets close to the of 6Â½ percent, reserve draining might begin about contemporaneously with the around your number is.  If inflation is at the upper tolerance, conditional on guidance is, then we're more likely to view 6Â½ percent as closer to a trigger in that But if the inflation projections are 1Â½ percent, then I'm in the camp with we should very quickly withdraw you would going to need to judge some type of will need to be contemporaneous with the decision to I would think about trying to gone through as much detail as I have, I'm not optimistic that going to be able to put that nicely into a principles statement.  But if we could, that would I think that's more tactical, and it's not high principle. play threshold level expected liftoff of the funds rate-but that's a big 'if'-if the inflation projection is 2Â¼ percent or whatever what our conditionality. President Kocherlakota-there's no reason why accommodation when inflation is not a problem and unemployment is too high.  Then not want reserve draining to start too soon.  I think we're response function of the funds rate with the unemployment rate and our inflation projection.  It strongly suggests to me that draining actually increase the funds rate at a future meeting.  So that's how describe this.  However, having we're be fine.

I've already pretty much answered.  I think we can reduce MBS SOMA should be Treasuries only.  The path could be simply short-term Treasuries, and securities in general; that would be fine by The remaining questions assets slowly.  Terminal redemptions, and selling me.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President George.

I would agree with providing clarity around of changes since 2011.  I think that would enhance expectations and agree with those MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. the exit strategy in light reduce some uncertainty, and I would do that sooner rather than later.  I think I

April 30-May 1, 2013

commented about what being clear means-that the communication is about our ability going to be important, and we'll need that portfolio, but that said, I would not for how we shift assets in there. I wanted to mention is in terms of describing the long-run operating procedures. study this, but I would take some of the steps that were control over the short-term interest rate.  Thank you. who've to manage an exit versus actual exit plans, notwithstanding my own preference.  I do think relying more on high-level principles, as Vice Chairman Dudley and President Kocherlakota have emphasized, and leaving out the tactics is flexibility during the policy-normalization process.  I prefer that we retain the commitment to eliminate agency securities and return to a Treasury encumber such a commitment with any specific time frames The final thing We have time to get some experience and in the staff memo to ensure that the mechanics of liftoff proceed smoothly.  And we should think more about exploring some of the options they proposed in those recent background memos for how we improve

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Pianalto.

years after we circumstances have changed considerably, key lesson that I draw from this experience is that specificity has its costs, and In MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As we all know, nearly two published our exit principles, the outlook and policy and, because we don't know what the future will bring, I think we should be careful on how we revise the published exit strategy.  In preparing for that uncertain future, we should take care to preserve the credibility of those principles that we view as strategic.  The bar to changing a principle should be high, and if a change is warranted, it needs to be convincingly explained to the public.  A perhaps we were more declarative and specific about tactical details than we should have been in 2011.  When the time does come to tighten monetary conditions, I don't know what the size and composition of our balance sheet will be or what financial market conditions will prevail.

April 30-May 1, 2013

we just don't know will have.  While I think we should tell the public as much as we anticipate about the exit strategy, I would be careful about presuming too much about revising the exit strategy, I agree with others who have spoken ahead of elements of policy normalization.  And I are similar to those, I and sequencing details to be specified by future Committees. addition, the tactical exit decision will be made by a future Committee, and what preferences they reasonably the future.  Therefore, in me that we should preserve the existing broad strategic think that the staff did this well in the six bulleted items that they wrote down in their background memo.  Beyond those six elements or a set of principles that would leave the timing a problem if our published Desk's April Survey of Primary Dealers, we example, most dealers don't our MBS portfolio at all, let alone in three to five years.  To maintain agree on changes to our exit strategy over the course of this meeting and soon as possible. the developments of the past two years, I would suggest that we and less tactical in order to provide more flexibility to The changes in our forward guidance enable us to downplay the and instead focus us more on principles and flexibility. I indicated a few minutes ago, I think the bar to changing principles should be years ago include a commitment return to an all-Treasury portfolio, and the reason that we put that in is that we want With those general comments, let me quickly answer the questions.  Regarding question 1, even though we don't know what the future holds, I think we have statements lose credibility.  And based on the appear to have reached that point with our exit principles.  For expect us to sell transparency, if we can the next, I think we should publish the changes after the next meeting or as Turning to question 2, in light of revise the exit strategy to be more general the Committee in the future. tactical elements of the exit strategy On question 3, as high.  The principles of the exit strategy that we published two to eventually to minimize the extent to which the SOMA portfolio might affect credit allocation.  As President

April 30-May 1, 2013

years ago.  So unless we are prepared allocation, I would just prefer to keep the agree to retain the principle of returning to an eliminating the MBS from our balance sheet as a gradual course of and not actively sell.  But at this point, I would for some time in the future. Lacker mentioned, at this point, we haven't explained to the public why we've become less concerned about credit allocation today than we were two to explain that change in our thinking about credit principle as it is.  Responding to question 4, if we all-Treasury portfolio, I consider the plan for tactical one, and I wouldn't include it in our set of principles.  Depending on the conditions in the economy and financial markets, it could be appropriate to follow a more allowing MBS to just run off of our balance sheet leave that decision in a repos and term Of these other with shorter remaining maturities seem the most promising, in the sense a decent level of reserve draining without any obvious downsides.  Still, with the exit, sales of Treasury It would be And regarding the potential sales of Treasury securities with shorter remaining maturities, from the background memo prepared for this meeting, I came away with the sense that, to get reserves down to where we need them, we'll need to expand the reserve-draining toolkit variety of ways, and it seems as though we'll need to use not only reverse deposits, but also other tools, which include overnight repos, sales of Treasuries with shorter remaining maturities, and even, perhaps, an increase in reserve requirements. tools, sales of Treasuries of offering clearly far into the future, I don't think a tactical decision or plan to use the securities with shorter remaining maturities is something we need to publicize now. better to wait until exit is more imminent and the set of tools is more refined.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

saying that, in thinking about exit or normalization-whichever phrase difficult to talk about it without knowing where you're going.  You've you're trying to get to before you can design a set of actions that are going to you where you want to go.  It's very important that we think about it in that sense.  And so I environment going forward.  In that sense, I the 2011 statement of well.  It has been very important to have articulated a set of environment where the funds rate was our instrument; that return to an all-Treasuries portfolio.  Those were the principles, I thought, laid out in important and, from my perspective, still stand today.  As many get there.'  Fine.  The has grown, and its composition has changed I believe that the principles generally apply, the tactics, indeed, I don't know how to change those tactics, at this point, until I know get there-what the size of the balance sheet is and what its Let me start by we want to use-it's very got to decide where get think it's important to talk about our operating think-like President Williams, President Lacker, and several others-that principles has actually served us very principles in that document, and they're pretty close to describing where we wanted to be.  We desire to return to an operating requires shrinking the balance sheet to the point where we can manage the funds rate.  And we desire to that memo, which are very people have said, 'Well, the tactics may need to be changed about how we tactics are going to be dictated in part by where we are when we start to normalize, and we don't know where that's going to be.  Our balance sheet since our exit principles, so while may have to be changed. what it's going to look like when we composition is.

some of the tactical stuff, but I am very example, when it comes to the adoption of I'm sympathetic with the notion of backing off on cautious to do much with that in a rush.  For

April 30-May 1, 2013

in the forward guidance, we've already changed our forward guidance several times changing the exit principles much disruption, though sometimes less change may be desirable.  I don't think exit principles right now.  We need some patience to be (a) where we're going and then (b) what our position is going to look like when thresholds since June 2011.  In August, we created a time-date; we've changed that time-date three times; and then we switched to thresholds.  It's not obvious to me that would create as we need to adopt any changes in the comfortable with we get there, where we can ask, 'Okay.  What are the tactics of moving from here to our long run?'

good idea at all to try to move the exit principles up in generality, to them altogether, or to gut them from any content other than saying, 'We're going to do going to keep financial stability, and we're not going to let our mandates go.' don't think it's very confidence-inspiring relative to where That would be backtracking, in my view.  So I'd like to keep as many of the as we already have.  I strongly support retaining the commitment to eliminate I feel much the way Lacker does on that.  I believe we should be returning to a corridor system that, in as a commitment device against us using the balance sheet for purposes And if we were to have a very large balance sheet and operate that funds rate or short-term interest rates, we really ought to have a set of rules as to how we will use that balance sheet, rather than leaving it as a I don't think that's a eliminate good things, we're I don't think that's helpful, and I we've been already. principles in place agency securities from our portfolio and returning to all Treasuries. President normal times, constrains our balance sheet.  By having an operating system that constrains our balance sheet, it serves other than monetary policy. at normal levels, I think that, given that it would be separate from our primary monetary policy tool, which would be the guidelines and completely discretionary, unspecified, free parameter for the conduct by the central bank.  In that

April 30-May 1, 2013

system.  I also don't think we gain much by reminded of about the hobbit Bilbo not being willing to give up the ring.  I kind of about the balance sheet.  We've got this really big balance sheet that we could use great purposes, but we just don't want to let it go.  But it may be the right thing to for very extraordinary, extreme circumstances, whether we have or we need to be a lender of last resort.  We can always do that, but, boy, sense, I feel strongly about returning to a corridor retaining MBS in the portfolio.  Regarding the balance sheet, by the way-I'm President Williams's story feel that way for all of these let it go and reserve it only another financial crisis I hate to be using it in normal times.

also been suggested that we can avoid the political cost of incurring losses and altogether or just let MBS securities run off.  I think know the right given path of accommodation, we could guidance or interest rate changes that would compensate for the effect of larger Let me give you a little on work that the Philadelphia staff has done on this.  They've simple New Keynesian model with perfect foresight, perfect credibility, and LSAPs they've guidance to offset or react to changes in the LSAPs and from forward guidance.  The a lot on forward guidance, and LSAPs will depend on the scenario being considered.  For early end to LSAPs can be offset either by delaying a by flattening the pace of the rise in the funds rate path after liftoff.  That It's deferred assets if we refrain from asset sales it is way too soon for us to commit to such a strategy.  I just don't think we answer to that.  I don't think it's at all clear that, for any use forward balances. taken a very that affect estimates in the larger range of what the empirical results have suggested, and investigated the ability of changes in forward LSAPs.  Admittedly, this framework would not be my preferred framework, but it is a framework that allows for very powerful effects from problem is that, with the zero bound as binding, we have to rely our ability to offset the path of example, the analysis suggests that an funds rate liftoff date or

April 30-May 1, 2013

the analysis also shows that the effect of not selling assets and just and holding a very large balance sheet for a much longer time may be seems to work okay, but allowing them to run off very difficult to offset that effect through changes in the funds rate path and forward guidance.

effects of future policy stances the timing of the adjustments of the funds rate and the size of the LSAPs to be greater bang for the buck, get a big rise in inflation expectations now.  And if that's big enough, it would be rate increases.  What this means is that the changes current economy if they follow, rather than LSAPs.  For example, if we announce that we will hold assets will be the current effect given level of policy accommodation. I think that the key insight of this is recognizing that the forward guidance-primarily, in this model, working through inflation expectations-amplifies the on the current economy, which is exactly what many people would like to see forward guidance do.  Therefore, it renders balance sheet critically intertwined in some way.  Loosely speaking, by committing larger for longer, or the duration of the portfolio to be longer, it gives and you in fact very difficult to offset that with current funds in the funds rate path have more impact on the precede, the effects of changes in to maturity and not engage in sales, the longer we do that, the bigger from the LSAPs and the faster we will have to raise the funds rate path in the near term to achieve any a relatively simple model, which has a lot a lot of our models.  But it does seem to me to suggest that holding for very long times, as I said, will lead to steeper interest rate choices in the near term. I'm very reluctant to signal that we will keep the balance sheet very large for a just think that, at this point, we don't know enough about and Now, I understand that this analysis is based on of assumptions in it, like balances For this reason, long time and not sell.  I understand the interactions between our balance sheet decisions and the path of forward guidance and the funds rates that we may have to follow going forward.  So I'm reluctant to

April 30-May 1, 2013

That said, I agree that the time frame for returning to an all-Treasuries portfolio I don't see any point in having 'three to five years' in there, at this point.  But I don't I don't think it's necessary. commit to that. will depend on how large the balance sheet ultimately becomes.  We don't know the answer to that, and want to put another number in there, either, because

Treasuries, and that was question 4.  At that time, allowing maturing Treasuries to run expected to result in a sizable decline in reserves, because the average maturity of our was not anticipated necessary.  With the changes in the composition of our portfolio over the past two years, want to sell Treasuries during exit to reduce the size of the portfolio more we're aiming to return to an all-Treasuries I don't think we can commit now to what the pace of sales is going to be until we LSAPs are ended. Finally, our June 2011 exit strategy principles discuss sales of MBS but do not mention sales of off was Treasury holdings at that time was quite a bit shorter.  So, selling securities as being it could be that we'd quickly.  But it's not obvious to me that, because portfolio, that may be the best strategy in achieving the right composition that we may be striving for. know about both the composition and size of the portfolio at the time the

I suggested at the last meeting, one of the things, though, that we may want to example, I think we might be well served by that, at the end of the day, that could provide the Committee with its composition.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As consider is our current reinvestment policies.  For considering curtailing reinvesting the runoffs in MBS in MBS and, instead, begin reinvesting those in shorter-term Treasuries.  This would begin a gradual process of reducing duration of the portfolio gradually, and beginning to rebalance it toward Treasuries gradually, by changing that reinvestment policy.  I believe a lot more flexibility down the road as we try to juggle the pace at which the balance sheet declines and

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard.

April 30-May 1, 2013

you, Mr. Chairman.  I have just some brief comments.  First of couple of years.  The Chairman and many others have been occasions-daily, perhaps-about what we're going to do about exit, MR. BULLARD.  Thank all, let me agree with President Williams and others.  I do think our exit principles have been exceptionally valuable during the last questioned on numerous and it's been very valuable to have those principles in place.

good time to make any changes.  As Governor Duke, Governor Tarullo, and President I wouldn't try complicated issues.  I will propose that we assign the detailed normalization discussion to a subcommittee, and that we subcommittee report back to us at some point in the future.  I think it's worked On question 1, about the timing of any revision to exit principles, I don't think that now is a very Evans noted, discussion of exit is often taken as a notion that some decision has been made that exit is near.  And that's a troublesome factor for this Committee at this juncture, so to do too much with the exit principles right now.  I have a suggestion in this regard.  These are technical and discussion and the associated operating procedure have that exceptionally well on the communications issue.

an are a lot of ways you can do this, and it's not quite clear exactly is.  And I think President Plosser is exactly right, and as Governor Duke and you are trying to be in the long run really affects how you would go to deal with at the FOMC level, and so I'd at least subcommittee work on this and report back with a recommendation or a In our previous discussion, Governor Yellen described the exit strategy as overdetermined system.  There what the right way others have indicated, where about this.  These strike me as not easy issues give thought to having a set of recommendations that might be easy to work with for the Committee.

On the revisions of principles and how they interact with thresholds, I do think that thresholds have helped us get away from the date-based forward guidance.  That's been very

April 30-May 1, 2013

I'd like to remind people that forward guidance is a policy tool only going to make The way I was thinking about thresholds and exit we pass a threshold sufficiently far that the Committee is ready to put the discarded, as they wouldn't make any sense you're in the exit phase and you're not trying to promise to stay lower for the rocket, and you're discarding the booster rocket at some point.  I think I was asking Vice Chairman Dudley earlier about going to be a lot of discussion about what the Committee is appropriate.  But one of the first things the Committee might do is to first steps in the proposed exit strategy.  That seems okay to me. useful for the Committee. because of the zero lower bound.  Accordingly, I don't think that thresholds are any sense or play any role as a long-term tool. was that, well, once exit machinery in motion, these thresholds will be anymore because now longer.  You've got that's the way to think about it, so that's why his views on this.  I don't see that as particularly confusing.  Of course, when you get near to the time of these thresholds, there is going to do?  And that's take one of the

I do agree with Presidents Lacker, Williams, and Evans that the portfolio.  I do prefer for the willing to introduce somewhat more flexibility on the On retaining MBS, Committee should reaffirm its long-run goal to return to a Treasuries-only that we be out of individual markets, as a matter of principle.  I think that's a good place central bank to be in the long run.  I am pace of sales of MBS, but, ultimately, they should move off the balance sheet.  The Congress has other institutions for intervening in housing markets.

question 4, sales of MBS or Treasuries during exit, I agree with President Fisher on you recall, I've long maintained that a gradual, state-contingent pace of sales as to raising the policy rate.  Frankly, I think the a mild form of insanity on this issue.  Once the balance sheet is down to On this.  As some of a first step in the exit process would be preferable Committee suffers from a more manageable size, the Committee could make a decision about rates.  This would allow

April 30-May 1, 2013

you to maintain lower policy rates for longer.  That seems to be exactly what we're trying to do.

So I think that that would be a preferable way to do the exit.  I lost that debate earlier, but perhaps once this gets into subcommittee [laughter], that view might be reconsidered.

when you repeat something over and over and MR. FISHER.  Remember, insanity is over.  [Laughter]

changed in important for the funds rate rendered portions of the reaction to that shift better off recasting the exit principles in a manner that de-emphasizes and intervals, instead clarifying the economic conditionality of our future actions. a revised statement of exit principles should de-emphasize details and, alerted markets that we alter our MBS strategy.  I believe we owe the public greater clarity on this issue as soon as I agree with Governor Tarullo and President Lockhart that it's important to change MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with those who have stressed that it served us well to have a set of exit principles.  But circumstances have ways since we adopted them, and adjusting them soon would have a number of benefits.  First, our adoption of threshold-based forward guidance existing principles obsolete.  More important, however, the positive market suggests that we'd be calendar dates In particular, I agree that instead, emphasize that we'll use our various tools in support of our chosen stance of monetary policy, and that that stance will be expressed in terms of a target level for short-term interest rates.  Another reason to revise the exit principles is that we've already may possible.  But

April 30-May 1, 2013

the appropriate of a press conference in June could make that our exit principles in a way that it will be perceived as technical adjustments reflecting changes in our circumstances and not be confused as a shift in our views concerning stance of policy.  And I'd say that the availability an opportune time to adopt a revised policy.

Dudley.  I think we face a guidance links moves in the after exit-and our current forward guidance implicitly takes that as a decision that reserves to establish better control of that rate But then we face the problem of, how do we, in effect, avoid saying to we've undertaken draining action, that policy has now been placed on a which a liftoff of our target for the funds rate will happen at some Dudley that it advantageous to deal with this quandary and, more generally, to switch to a on the GC repo rate and use standing repo and facilities to establish a narrow corridor is something that I really think is deserving at the time of liftoff and run, but also, as Vice Chairman Dudley suggested, possibly even sooner as a way a short-term rate. Before continuing with the questions for discussion prepared by the staff, I'd like to emphasize how much I agree with Governor Duke and Vice Chairman difficult quandary due to our reliance on the fed funds rate as our target.  Our exit strategy really needs to support our new threshold-based forward guidance, but that federal funds rate target to evolving economic conditions.  Now, if we stick with the funds rate as our target we've made-I don't see how we avoid draining after we lift the target. markets, just as soon as predetermined course at predetermined future date?  So I agree with Governor Duke and Vice Chairman could be extremely framework that would focus on a different short-term rate as a target and one that we could control without having to drain enough reserves that the funds rate becomes less idiosyncratic and thin.  And the suggestion that we could focus reverse repo of staff study.  It could make sense to be operating in this way not only over the longer to establish control over

April 30-May 1, 2013

revise the exit principles now, we face the question about what to do in terms of that the proposal circulated by President Kocherlakota referring to our acting primarily, in his words, 'by influencing center stage in our forward Over time, it may make sense for us to inform the public that we are considering a and that of other central banks operating with different kinds of If we references to the funds rate.  I thought very nicely finessed this issue by the federal funds rate and other market interest rates.'  For now, I think this would be a satisfactory solution, given that the funds rate currently does take guidance. number of longer-run options, and that we're debating their various merits and drawbacks based on our own recent experience procedures.

a revised exit strategy strips almost all detail of I think this has some attraction.  At the same time, I a communications tool, and that I agree with the general point that, as far as that we have a Treasury securities close to maturity, President Kocherlakota's proposal for implementation out of the exit principles. think it is important to keep in mind that our exit principles are they have worked to reassure the public that we've carefully thought about the issues, that we're confident we have a plan that will work, and that we intend to make sure that any asset sales that we undertake will not disrupt financial markets.  But the normalization process is concerned, it would be helpful simply to convey range of tools available to drain reserves, including sales of but that we'll decide on and communicate the specifics of such operations only as the time approaches.

And I thought the analytical and operational expertise, it would be prudent to hold, in normal times, at least a modest share of MBS securities in the SOMA portfolio.

First of consider our MBS purchases the most efficacious part of our asset purchase program, and risk that we'll be locked into a program that, yields and mortgage rates. perspective of reducing capital losses, focusing any sales on securities is beneficial.  So, for these reasons, I would recommend that we exit, we may sell shorter-dated Treasuries.

Second, we'd diminish the when the time comes to execute it, could fuel a sharp backup in MBS And of course, from the that are close to maturity eliminate from the revised exit principles our promise to sell MBS, and that we add the possibility that, sometime during uncertainties we face during exit, preserving optionality is valuable.

Principles are supposed to be that drive tactics, rather than the tactics themselves.  What we prepared, I exit MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Some of the current exit strategy appear out of date.  This be timeless.  So, in some ways, I think, like President last exit strategy document when we created and adopted statements of outcome think, were some statements of outcome and some statements of tactics, rather than the statements of outcome alone that drive the tactics.  And now we see that these tactics of

The first guidepost would be operational flexibility, the depleting as compared with what we have now with our current set of principles. we can to maintain extended period of time that will span the exit exit isn't imminent, and the process of exit will be a protracted one.  So the what steps, with what years hence. choices. revisions would be prompted by a perceived need to update the existing set in light of the as in light of the need to harmonize the actions that have been taken since the time of the initial set of exit strategy confidence depleting need to, nor should final decisions about our operating framework, nor about the particular mix of To start with the questions, in order to answer question 1, about the best time for the Committee to adopt and release answer by saying that I think that, if revisions are them with three second guidepost would be policy neutrality, and the third guidepost would be to not be confidence First, if we're to tackle revisions now, I think we should do everything maximum operational flexibility during the process.  The time of last thing we should do is to pretend to presume that we will know exactly tools, and in what order and what operating framework will be necessary several Second, any revisions, if they're undertaken now, shouldn't contain embedded policy Any size and composition of the balance sheet, as well principles with policy principles.  So, considering flexibility, policy neutrality, and not being together, it seems that, in order to adopt and release any revision, we don't we, come to any draining tools and contractionary devices that we'd be implementing.

any such revision doesn't seem as important as the conceptual distinction and the adoption of any policy action, such as Ideally, by maximizing the timing between a sequencing announcement, we would minimize the possibility that the exit strategy and then make the adjusting/calibrating decision.  I don't think it matters appear conceptually distinct so as not to be viewed as part of choices. adoption and release of between a release of such revised principles adjusting or calibrating in the future. document and a policy revision gets interpreted as a policy action.  For example, we could first make an adjusting/calibrating decision and then release revised principles, or we could first release the revised principles which comes first, as long as they the same package of policy that we not inadvertently communicate that the exit strategy after this meeting, the minutes will reflect the fact that there that the new statement is in fact a operational flexibility and is policy neutral and is not confidence conscious to the possibility will be perceived as part of a bigger set of policy moves and then could effects on the market's perception of choices. To increase the possibility revisions constitute a policy step, was extensive discussion about revisions to the exit strategy principles.  The Chairman could then ask the staff to prepare such revisions, and, assuming statement that preserves depleting, the statement could be adopted and released at any time.  However, to the extent that we embed policy into the exit strategy, I'd argue that we have to stay that our revised strategy have unintentional and confusing and confidence-depleting our policy

I can also imagine of mortgage-backed securities, or that might explicitly

This seems to me like a very straightforward call.  It gets rid of potential problems and has First, with respect to MBS holdings, my preference would be to eliminate any commitment to sell them over the near-to-medium term and to clarify this sooner rather than later.

April 30-May 1, 2013

I can see.  I want to say, though, that to the extent that we explain this would much prefer to emphasize the market-functioning and financial going to cause disruption, of the bid-asked spread, and cost taxpayers?  That's all not good.  I I don't think it should be a rationale. no real downside, as far as decision publicly, I stability considerations-the simple fact that, why do we want to be selling securities that are now seasoned and in a more illiquid part of the market, which is only put us on the wrong side wouldn't be emphasizing the fact that we're doing this to smooth remittances.  That's a byproduct, fine, but memo, I would prefer to retain we want to run a floor or a corridor system.  That applies to whether we a small, token inventory of MBS to be playing with.  I'm completely at this point; I just don't see any reason to decide now.  It also applies to something that want to have, on the Treasury side, a somewhat we need even for, say, a floor system, simply because we want to have I personally am kind of fond of it, but, look-it's just a gleam you careful not to say something that absolutely think that just goes to the flexibility point. On pretty much everything else discussed in the optionality, as would many others.  We'll just know more later, and we'll be in a better position. That applies to whether want to ultimately have agnostic President Rosengren brought up, which is, do we larger balance sheet than Treasuries of different maturities that we can move around in an MEP-style way, say, for financial stability considerations? in the eye at this point.  So one certainly wouldn't want to put that out there as something want to affirmatively do.  You might want to be precludes it, and again, I

At the same Here I Again-obviously, flexibility is time, anything we can do to accelerate the learning process affirmatively is also good. want to agree with the points that Governor Yellen, Governor Duke, and others have made about the reverse repo stuff.  I see no reason not to push forward affirmatively with figuring out if we

I don't see any reason to wait to do that until we're at the point of rates.  I don't think it should confuse anybody that we're getting ready to We're just getting the plumbing in order, in some fundamental sense.  So that's a useful should preserve the and then get to work on taking advantage of that.  I think that's how to think about it. can make that workable. actually having to raise exit. thing to do.  We don't need to talk about it.  That falls under tactics, but we flexibility how we best communicate all of this, in a first-best world, as can do this with a set of simplified, high-level principles that are not overly in the spirit of what Narayana had, that's the ideal.  If we find ourselves we have to go a subcommittee route, then I would prefer to short-circuit Dan said-with something in the statement or in a press conference and not getting drawn into probably more where I am.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Then, on the question of Dan said, if we committing, pretty much getting bogged down, if this-again, as spend a lot of time litigating all of this and then inevitably specificity than would be ideal.  That's

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Powell.

but it no longer reflects where the Committee made, or where we intend to go.  We have signaled the market that we're need to follow through in some way.  Let me say what I think the general public and the different audiences-that we can exit, that we can do it in an orderly of those sorts of things.  That's really what we're I think that naturally breaks down into a stripped-down set of principles.  I set from June 2011.  There are also going to be tactical decisions, which MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would agree with others that the June 2011 statement served its purpose very well over time, is, decisions that we've thinking about it, and we objective is, and that is to increase confidence-on the part of both the marketplace, which are fashion, and that we have the tools and all trying to do.  And would start with what President Kocherlakota had and work out from that, rather than working in from the larger, mixed

April 30-May 1, 2013

some of them now, those belong in the principles as simple as possible than to do it in a statement of principles. we should make only when it serves us to.  I think it does serve us to make and I'll come back to that.  I actually don't have a great feeling for whether minutes or in the statement of principles.  But anyway, I do think that they're separate, and I would prefer to keep the a question:  What does the market really need to hear from us now, I guess I'll start with in the summer-almost summer-of 2013?  It'll be summer, if not fall, by the time we're done with this.  [Laughter]

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  It's still winter in Minneapolis.

a chance to talk about the development of the tools, There's the elevator speech also need to get a growing sense of we've thought quite carefully about this and have a credible plan, and going to move predictably in a stately pace, minimizing volatility, disruption, costs, going to adapt to follow past practices or return to past practices I certainly hope that we can; it seems as though we ought to be able to, but like what Dan, Jeremy, and others referred to, Chairman talks about various decisions in a kind of thing.  But I see that as a far less attractive alternative. MR. POWELL.  I think it's three things.  First, we're confident that we have the tools to manage the exit, particularly that we can tighten policy and exert control over short-term interest rates when the time comes.  That gives us which is a really important message.  Again, different audiences: that President Evans referred to, but market participants confidence over time, as we approach normalization, that we can do this.  Second, everyone needs to understand that that we're and all of that.  And, third-I think importantly-during exit, we are circumstances as they evolve and not just blindly or follow a battle plan that was authored years ago, before the process began.  If we can't reach agreement-and we'll see-then I would support doing something which is to have a stripped-down thing where the press conference and that

April 30-May 1, 2013

talk about a couple of things in particular, let's talk about MBS.  Frankly, the most MBS decision, to me, is the financial stability aspect, and I think it serves Vice Chairman Dudley said-make a not a commitment never to sell them-and a commitment to return to an all-Treasury balance sheet, I'm fine with that-but I financial stability could erupt.  You're selling into an illiquid market.  You're we don't hedge-which will involve shorting I just think that's a good thing to do, and frankly, I believe we should decide it are going to say that now, I also like the idea of allows us to say that take a whole lot longer.  So I like pairing those two up and making a To important aspect of the us to make the decision now along the lines of what decision not to sell MBS until a certain point.  It's regarding would commit not to sell them as part of the normalization process.  This, to me, is the very place where forcing the new buyers to hedge-whereas securities.  So now even though it is obviously tactical.  If we offsetting it with the sales of short-term Treasuries.  Pulling that in normalization won't really decision now.

said.  They statement.  They're out there now, and that probably is not you need to address. Thresholds-they're out there.  I don't know whether anything needs to be shouldn't be in the new principles something would echo others that I would walk away from our too-strong embrace, I think, of the the single policy tool of choice.  As Governor Duke pointed out, the market years to reduce reserves to the point at which they have any scarcity value, let alone with the efficient implementation of monetary going to be slippage between interest on reserves and the I federal funds rate as now expects that reserves are going to be $2Â½ trillion.  If that turns out to be what happens, it'll take several to 'the smallest levels that would be consistent policy.'  In the meantime, there is federal funds rate, and the relationship may not be a stable one.  I don't doubt the efficacy of the

April 30-May 1, 2013

don't doubt the quality of the work that's been done on that, but this is because I well to suggest that we use interest on reserves to tighten financial range of short-term interest rates.  And again, I do have confidence in going to manage monetary policy through the federal funds some other means is years of happy discussion, but it's just not a decision we need to tools in the memo, and I just not something we need to decide right now.  So I would just loosen that statement think Narayana did very conditions by raising a that.  The decision whether we're rate, as in the days of old, or through a corridor system or a floor system or going to be the subject of many make now.

as the timing of announcing a rethought exit strategy, I guess I think it should after or contemporaneously with a decision to reduce purchases.  Today's discussion for an announcement before a a significant comment to the market, so I would I am.  Thanks, Mr. Chairman. As far come either has added to my confidence that it's probably not going to be ripe decision to reduce purchases.  And I wouldn't see it as a way of making about the timing of normalization.  The strategy should be independent of the timing.  But there is a risk that talking about it will convey a sense of an earlier departure say that it's better to wait until after we taper.  That's where

I do think that there was a good deal of agreement.  What we'll do is to see if we can put whether to go forward with some formal principles or to use a more informal what was said not only about flexibility, but about the need to have enough information that it provides confidence to the public that we, CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Thanks, everyone.  I won't try to summarize, but together a set of potential principles for discussion and comment, and, based on the reaction to that, we'll decide process to communicate this.  I agree with a lot of also in fact, are able to exit and to manage interest rates as we need to at the appropriate time.  Thank
