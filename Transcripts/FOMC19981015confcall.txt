CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Good afternoon, eryone.  This  is irst    information ev f an meeting,  ut t  s onceivable  hat  e will onclude he  meeting y  taking n  action,  epending b i i c t w c t b a d on what  evolves uring ur  discussion. t  me begin  by  calling   Mike Prell  o  bring s  up  to d o Le on t u date  on  what  is oing  on  in he conomy. Mike. g t e

MR. PRELL.  Thank you. There  have  been  some significant  velopments ince e de s w prepared  he  last  orecast,  t hat  we have  on  balance s ore a  matter f ncertainties his t f bu w i m o u at t point  han  clear-cut  anges  in  the utlook.  e  have  had  some weaker  economic  indicators t ch o W at he  margin  for he hird  uarter  han  we had  anticipated.  e employment report  or t t t q t Th f September  was on  the  weak side. e  have  no  special  tory.  t ay simply e  statistical  se, W s I m b noi but  employment growth  was discernibly  aker  than ecent  rends nd  below our xpectations. we r t a e Tomorrow, we will e  publishing dustrial  oduction  or eptember.  We  anticipated  me b in pr f S so modest  growth  in  production, d  instead  e will eport    significant line  or he onth. an w r a dec f t m

In  the onsumer  sector, is  ay be  too  fine   reading,  ut  around  the dges he icture c th m a b e t p looks  a  little  aker  than e had  anticipated.  nauto  retail les  or ugust  and  September we w No sa f A were  quite ubdued.  Even allowing  or he  strength  have  seen  in  the  sales  f otor  vehicles, s f t we o m consumer  expenditures  ook  to  have  been  marginally  eaker  than he  3-1/2  percent  rowth  rate  hat l w t g t we had  in  the eptember  meeting reenbook.  Of  course,  e have  seen  some slippage  n  the S G w i indicators  r onsumer  sentiment.  he stock arket  has  dropped  even  more than e fo c T m w

anticipated, ugh  at his  oint    think  t  s  still ch in  line ith  the evel  e had  predicted  s tho t p I i i mu w l w a the  average or he  fourth  uarter.  ut  to ate he  market  has  had  a  more negative  one nd  that f t q B d t t a may be  taking  ome toll  n  sentiment. s o

On the  inflation  de,  he age news has  been  good.  Average  hourly arnings  n si t w e i September  are  giving  s  still eater nfidence  hat  e are  on  the ight  rack  n  our  forecast u gr co t w r t i ofa leveling  ut  in  wage inflation  d  possibly  ome deceleration    coming  months. With  regard o o an s in t the  price ews,  the PI  this  orning  was much worse  than e anticipated.  sically,  e ntire n P m w Ba th e surprise  as in  the otor  vehicles  rea,  hich  accounted or lmost ll f  the ise  n  the  core PI. w m a w f a a o r i P We  have  found  it  ery  difficult  guess hat  the hanges  in  motor  vehicle  rices  ill  e  in v to w c p w b September  when there s  a  model  change  occurring.    guess  ould  interpret  at  igure  s i I Iw th f a suggesting    little  ss  avorable  rend n roducer rices  or inished ods  than e had  in  mind a le f t i p p f f go w previously.  ut  basically  see  that  PI  number for inished ods  and  the act  hat  rices  f B we P f go f t p o crude  and  intermediate  terials re  down  as  not  calling r ny  fundamental hange  in  our ma we fo a c assessment f he  underlying  rice rends  n  the  economy. Indeed,  t his  oint    relatively  w o t p t i a t p a lo capacity  tilization  e uggests  hat  he  goods  market  is uite  omfortable. u rat s t t q c

Looking  ahead, ertainly   have  heard egative  eports  bout  the  manufacturing  ector c we n r a s that uggest hat  here s ome greater  eakness  than  we might  have  anticipated.    do  not  hear s t t i s w We very  much yet hat  ndicates at here  s  any  greater  rosion  n  capital ending lans han  we t i th t i e i sp p t had  anticipated  uld be  occurring, t hat s learly  question  ark. I  think here the reatest wo bu t i c a m w g uncertainty ises  nd  leads o  a  bias erhaps n he isks  o  the conomy going  forward s  that ar a t p i t r t e i private  inancing  onditions ve  deteriorated  rther,  rticularly he  lower  quality ea.  That f c ha fu pa in  t ar has  occurred  espite  he asing f he  funds  rate  nd despite  he ecline  n  Treasury  ates, ich d t e o t a t d i r wh

we had  not  foreseen.    think ur ense s hat he enor f  the arkets  is uch more adverse o I o s i t t t o m m t private  orrowers han  we had  anticipated.    his  ere  to  persist r  ery  much longer,  believe b t Ift w fo v I there ould  be a  risk f ndermining he omentum  of  private  emand beyond  what  we had w o u t m d forecast eviously, d  thus  a  softer onomic  outlook  s  we move into  he  first lf  f  1999. pr an ec a t ha o But  we were  very ncertain  n  our  assessment  ast  ime  of hat  the imensions f  the isk u i l t w d o r spreads ould be,  how soon  they ould  narrow, ow soon  access o  markets  would  be  restored, w w h t and  we are o  less ncertain  t his  oint. learly, at  s   much more negative  lement f  the n u a t p C th i a e o economic  picture  t his  uncture. a t j

Mr.  Chairman,  I  think hat  s bout ll  an  contribute   this  oint  nless here  re ny t i a a Ic at p u t a a questions.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let  us  first ve to  Ted Truman. Do you have  any mo remarks  you wish  to ake? m

MR. TRUMAN. I  would  note hat,   course,  e have  no  new real ata n  the xternal t of w d o e sector.  ew  trade ata re oming  out  next  week for ugust, hich seems  like    long  time  ago. N d a c A w a The  dollar  as  weakened,  particularly inst  he  yen.  The positive ws is hat he eakness h aga t ne t t w has  also ulled  p  some of he ther sian  currencies.  do  not  have  a  ready xplanation r he p u t o A I e fo t dollar's  akness  against  he  yen. It as  weakened slightly  ainst  he  European  currencies. we t h ag t

With regard o  foreign  conomic  activity,  ould  say  that  he nformation at  as  come t e I  w t i th h in  over he ast  ew weeks  has  been  consistent  th  what  we were  saying. hat  implies  ome t l f wi T s sense  of   catch-up,     may put t hat  ay,  with he  somewhat weaker  outlook hat  e had  in a if I i t w t t w the  September  Greenbook.  There  are  nonetheless me small ositive  actors   my view. he so p f in T fact  hat  he MF legislation   ikely  o e  enacted  eans that  here  s ne less hoe  to  drop.  We t t I isl t b m t i o s

got  through he razilian ections. e Japanese ave  passed ome banking  bills,  t  no  one t B el Th h s bu knows quite ow they  are  going  to  implement  those ills. d h b An I think he  recent  nternational t i meetings  in  Washington  were somewhat of  a  reality  eck  for ur uropean  friends. ch o E

On the  other and, t s retty  lear  hat  lobally ere s  an  increase  n  financial resses. h i i p c t g th i i st When  we look  at ertain  ndicators  he ind  that  e look t or he .S.  economy--they re ot c i oft k w a f t U a n as  available road--they l how the  same kinds f ffects.  lthough  Brazil  s  through ts ab al s o e A i i elections,   s ot hrough  the ew economic  program.  There  is   question  bout he mplications iti n t n a a t i of  the erman elections. e international icy  omplexion  of  the ew government  leaves G Th pol c n some big  question  arks at  this  oint. ut  I  don't  hink  nything  as  basically  anged  in  our m p B t a h ch outlook.  e  had  a  weak outlook,  nd W a I think  he ownside  risks  re  still  ere. t d a th

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Don Kohn, would  you  like o  add  anything? t MR. KOHN. Just o  say hat think  ike Prell  ighlighted e  key  issue  ere,  amely t t I M h th h n what  is oing  on in  credit  arkets, s  think  resident Donough g m a I P Mc will e  commenting on in  a b few  minutes. here  certainly  s  been  more  volatility,  s iquidity,   less  illingness  ake T ha les l and w tot risks  ven  since he ommittee  meeting  only  2-1/2  weeks  ago.  The  extent  f he  spillover  to  he e t C o t in t commercial  banking  sector  s ncertain.  e  don't  ollect ta ften nough  to  know whether i u W c da o e bank spreads ave  risen, t  we have  had  confirming ata rom  other ources f he ightening h bu d f s o t t of lending erms  and  conditions. r Senior oan Officers  urvey  for he eriod hrough he  end  of t Ou L S t p t t September  provides  vidence hat ome tightening s  occurred,  articularly  oans o  larger e t s ha p forl t businesses.  think  hat  has  happened  here s hat  he anks  have  become increasingly  liant I w i t t b re on the  securities  rkets o  syndicate  heir  oans nd  to  manage their  ortfolios.   deterioration ma t t l a p As occurs n  securities  rkets,  t  nevitably  ills er  into  he anking ector, rhaps ven  more i ma i i sp ov t b s pe e quickly han  it ight  have  10 or  20  years go. t m a

In  my  view  it s easonable  rom  a  policy  erspective   anticipate  at inancial i r f p to th f conditions  re ikely   settle wn over  time n  this  ountry. e  have  seen  some rather  xtreme a l to do i c W e movements in  financial rkets  and  an  extreme  lack f  liquidity.  t  after nancial nditions ma o Bu fi co settle wn,  they re  likely   be  noticeably ghter an  they ere  a  month or  two  ago,  and do a to ti th w maybe even  tighter  an  we thought  hey ould  be  a  week or  two  ago.  Although hey ill ettle th t w t w s down,  I'm  reasonably  ertain  hat  ending erms nd  financial  nditions ll ook  tighter    a  lot c t l t a co wi l to of  borrowers,  t  least  or   while. a f a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Any questions  or he hree entlemen? f t t g

MR.  POOLE. This  is ill  oole. B P

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes.

MR. POOLE. I  was still    the ighway, o  I  did ot ear he PI  report.  an you  give on h s n h t P C me that  umber? n

MR. POOLE. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Any further  uestions? et  us  move on  and  I  would  like  o q L t call  n the  Vice  Chair o ring s  up  to  date n  what  he  sees n  the inancial rkets  around  the o t b u o i f ma world  and  especially    New  York,  which is f articular  terest.  ll. in o p in Bi

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. What we are  seeing here  in  the inancial rkets  in  the nited tates, ich  certainly  flect nancial nditions f ma U S wh re fi co elsewhere,  s  a  very  dramatic ncrease  n  risk  preads. et  me give ou  some examples. i i i s L y

The spread etween  the  on-the-run  0-year reasury ond  and  the  most  recently sued b 3 T b is Treasury  ond  before t, ich  normally uns  at bout   or  5 basis oints, ved up after  he b i wh r a 4 p mo t

Russian  debacle o  about  12  basis  oints.  hen,  in  the iddle f eptember  it  oved up some t p T m o S m more and  it s ow at  about  27  basis  oints.  gain, hat  ompares  with  the  usual   to  5  basis i n p A t c 4 points.  he  interest  te olatility sures emain  unusually  igh.  The actual  olatility  the T ra v mea r h v on long  bond  has  moved up  to  about 3  basis  oints.  t sually  uns t  about  5. The implied 2 p I u r a volatility   moved up  from  its  sual evel f bout  to  14. has u l o a 8

The quality  pread hat  e tend o  look t  the ost  is hat  etween  U.S.  Treasuries d s t w t a m t b an the ixed-interest  t f  a  swap. So  it  nvolves  ooking t  prime ank  rates,   ou will, f par o i l a b ify compared  to  U.S.  Treasuries.  he two-year,  hich  normally uns  at  about 5  basis oints,  ow T w r 3 p isn over  70.  The 10-year,  hich  is  hink  he  most  significant, mally uns  at bout 0 basis w It t nor r a 5 points  nd  is ow  approximately  5. The spread etween  Treasuries d 10-year nvestment a n 9 b an i grade  securities--Ford  or  Company  would  be  a  typical ample--usually  ns  at  about  75 Mot ex ru basis oints;  t  s ow 124. If e look  at he errill  ynch bond  index or BB  securities, ch p i i n w t M L f B whi is  an  indication  he  rate  or edium-sized ompanies  in  the apital rkets,  he ormal  spread oft f m c c ma t n between  those BBs  and  Treasuries   usually  bout  3.2  percentage  oints  nd  it  s ow at bout B is a p a i n a 6.3  percentage  oints.  his  is n indication,  elieve, t  only  that  he pread s ery  broad,  ut p T a I  b no t s i v b that o  financial ficer o is  not  smoking  pot ould  actually y o ssue  n  this  ind  of arket. n of wh w tr t i i k m We  have  the ery  unusual ituation   Treasuries elding re than unicipal onds.  So,  we v s of yi mo m b are  observing    concern or uality  n  the unicipal arket  as  well. a f q i m m

For  the ortgage-backed  ecurity read,  hich  of ourse as  a  close elationship  the m s sp w c h r to construction dustry, pecially  e ome construction ctor, e  normal  relationship  th in es th h se th wi Treasuries  s bout  110  basis  oints.   week ago  it  as up  to  about  195,  and  it  as  now backed i a p A w h off o  about  170. t

An indication at  inancial rket  participants   particularly cerned bout  the th f ma are con a quality  f inancial curities  rms hows up  in  the elationship  tween  the  S&amp;P  500  and  the o f se fi s r be stock ndexes or oney center anks  and  investment  anks.  If e go back  to  the nd  of  October i f m b b w e 1997,  the  S&amp;P  500  is p  a  little,   a  whole  lot,  rom  its  evel  t hat  ime. t  s ow about  102 u not f l a t t I i n percent  f ts  evel  hen.  he  money center  ank  index as  declined  o ust  nder  80  percent  f ts o i l t T b h t j u o i year-ago evel,  nd  the umber for nvestment  anks  is  down to  about 5 percent.  e  are  not,  f l a n i b 7 W o course,  n  the usiness  f  having o orry  about hose nstitutions    their  hareholders  he i b o t w t i and s int management of  our  affairs,  t  this  s n  additional dication  he  run nto uality  nd  the bu i a in oft i q a tremendous  risk  version  e are  seeing. a w

Just    word about he  clearing stems: e  have  had  to  keep  fed  wire  open  late  or  he a t sy W f t last  everal  ays  because f  requests  rom  the ecurities  rms nd  the anks--Chase nd  BONY-s d o f s fi a b a that  lear  or hem,  largely  s  hedge  fund ositions e nwound. That  is omething hat  s c f t a p ar u s t i a normal  part f ur  business, t  I  think t  s nother ndication  ome hiccups n  financial o o bu i i a i ofs i markets.

Mr.  Chairman,  this  s ob Parry. i B

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes,  Bob.

MR. PARRY. Mr.  Chairman,  have  two questions.  ne,  we have  seen  some spillover I O from  LTCM to  D.E.

MR.  PARRY. I  see.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. The other irm  that  olomon Brothers  leared  ut, f S c o MKP  Capital, d  also een  late  n some margin  calls.  e  have  not  been  hearing  nything  n ha b o W a o LTCM. There  was a  short eriod,    few days  of eething oblems,  hen the ive irms p a t pr w f f comprising he  oversight  ommittee  sent heir ople o  LTCM t c t pe t to  begin he rocess f anaging t p o m the  firm ather  ifferently.   there oes  seem to  have  been  a  greater laxation  he  market r d But d re int about  LTCM and  a  feeling  hat  he irms hat  ecapitalized  ave  the taying  ower  and  the t t f t r it h s p willingness   unwind  its  ositions   an orderly  asis  o  they o  not ust  ove the arket to p on b s d j m m against  hemselves. t

MR.  PARRY. Thank you. Do we know anything eyond  either  he  incident  nvolving b t i B&amp;A and  Shaw  and  what  I  guess as  affected    couple f ther  anks? Is  there nything  lse n h a o o b a e i that  rea? a

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. I  believe  here robably  re ome skeletons  till t p a s s rattling  ound  closets  hat  ave  not een  revealed  et.  We  do  not now.  Even the arkest ar t h b y k d rumors  do  not  suggest  nything f he  size r  shape  or otential  gnitude  of TCM. a o t o p ma L I  think  t  s i i a  reasonable  ssumption hat  e would  hear  about t f  t  ere  there. ut  that  s n assumption;  t a t w i i i w B i a i is ot  a  certainty. hink  e can  safely  ssume  that  here  ill e  some other  anks  that  ill  ave n I  t w a t w b b w h to  report  ome losses  ased  on  dealing  ith  people ho with  hindsight ey ish  they ad  not s b w w th w h been  dealing  ith. w

MR.  HOENIG. Bill, is  s om  Hoenig.  Just    clarification he  spreads:   realize th i T a on  t I they  have  widened  and  I  understand  hat  he unk ond  side f he  market  has  dried  p.  The t t j b o t u spreads n  investment  rade orporates  ave  increased, t t eems  to  me that  as  not  occurred o g c h bu i s h so  much because  corporate  ates  ave  risen  s  a  result  erceived  nusual isks.  ather,  he r h a ofp u r R t reason s  that  he  flight to reasuries s  lowered ates  n  Treasuries, us ausing he  spreads i t in T ha r o th c t to  widen.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. In  a  run  to  uality, m, I  think e always  have  a q To w certain  rrational  otient  nvolved. o,  if  ou were  to  ask  the eople acing nto  reasuries,  d i qu i S y p r i T an especially to n-the-run  reasuries,  ether  they  are ore worried bout he  Ford  Motor in o T wh m a t Company  than hey ere  two  months  ago, hey  would  say  "of ourse ot." n the  other  and, t w t c n O h their  ehavior  uggests  hat  hey ave  that  oncern. he other spect  o  it,  y  the ay,  is hat  e b s t t h c T a t b w t w

think he  spreads ould  probably e  wider  were  it ot or   general iew  in  the arket  that  he t w b n f a v m t high  quality  redits  ill ot e  issuing  ew obligations.  ,  if  e look  at he As, their  ominal c w n b n So w t A n rates  ave  actually me down some. It s he  spread hat  as  increased  ubstantially.   the h co i t t h s But view  in  the  Street re s hat  he eason he  nominal  rates  ave  come down  is he xpectation he i t t r t h t e that  here ill e  a  reduction  n  supply,  f  nly n  the bsence f ew issues  eaching  he arket. t w b i i o i a o n r t m Firms  simply  will ot  be  issuing  ew obligations d  securities  at  ature  will ot  be  replaced. n n an th m n

MR. HOENIG. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The very  substantial  duction  n  new issuance, ich  I re i wh gather  s uch across he  board,  learly   a  crucial  actor.  bviously,  he unk ond  issuance i m t c is f O t j b has  completely  ried p,  but  even  investment  rade ssuance  as  come down very  markedly. d u g i h dr s f ma i t c markets,  nd  that  s n  indication at he egree  of iquidity   he verall  inancial stem  is a i a th t d l int o f sy

There  has  been  a  fairly amatic hift  rom  the  securities  rkets nto  he ommercial  banking clearly  nder  stress. u

MR. PRELL.  Mr.  Chairman,  if    might ust  upplement hat ith  one  other  bservation: I j s t w o I  am told hat  o  date he ating  gencies  ave  not ut ery  many companies  on  their  atch  lists t t t r a h p v w for otential  wngradings.  This  suggests  hat  hey ave  not  at  least  o  this  oint  erceived, p do t t h t p p given  their onomic outlook,  hat  he efault  isks  or hese  irms ave  increased  reatly. ec t t d r f t f h g

MR. STERN. Mr.  Chairman,  this  s ary  Stern. ust  s  a  coincidence,   had  a  meeting i G J a we of  our  Advisory ouncil n Small  Business,  griculture,  d  Labor  yesterday  nd  a  directors' C o A an a meeting  this  orning.  I  think uch of hat  we have  been  discussing s evident  t hose m m w wa a t

meetings n  the  sense hat  here learly   some anxiety  bout he  overall  ituation  cluding i t t c is a t s in a good deal  of oncern bout  consumer  confidence, ven  the evelopments n  financial rkets. c a gi d i ma It ould be  remarkable f  hat  ere  not  the ase!  I  do  not  sense hat  hese nxieties ve  changed w i t w c t t a ha much in  the wo  and  a  half  eeks since he OMC t w t F meeting.  I  can't   very  precise  bout he be a t level f hese nxieties,  t  they  certainly  ve  been  around or ome time. o t a bu ha f s

What has  been  a bit urprising    me is hat  here  o  not  seem to  be  any  changes  in  the s to t t d economic  fundamentals hat  eople ave  reported.  'm ot  referring  ly  to  the ersistence t p h I n on p of tight  abor  arkets nd  squeezes n  earnings, t  a  number of  people n  construction,  r l m a o bu i fo example,  commented that  hey  are ooked up  through 999.  Obviously,  hey re  confident  nd t b 1 t a a optimistic    the oment, but  the lear  mplication s that  hey id  not  seem to  think  hat at m c i wa t d t cancellations  re likely  r  that  aterial  dverse hanges  were  just  round he  corner. o, we o m a c a t S despite  ome well  recognized  oncerns nd  anxieties,  e undamentals,  t  least  round  here, s c a th f a a seem to  be  pretty  uch in lace. hat  is ot  to  say, bviously, at  hings  an't  hange, ut   was m p T n o th t c c b I struck  f  nything  y what  I  took o  be  less  oncern  among our  contacts  bout heir n business i a b t c a t ow prospects  han  I  might  have  expected. t the ame time  there  as a  good deal f  concern  about t A s w o the  global ituation,   that  s   different  tter. s but i a ma

MR.  MCTEER. Mr.  Chairman,  this  s ob McTeer. i B

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes,  Bob.

MR.  MCTEER. Regarding he  issue f  fundamentals  n  the istrict,  the ast  wo  days  I t o i D in l t made a  speech  in  Austin nd  two in  Houston, o  different  nds f roups.  I  also ttended  ur a t ki o g a o San  Antonio  and  our  Dallas oard  meetings,  nd  I  have  a  report  his  orning  from  our ouston b a t m H board  meeting.  In  all  ases eople  are ot nterested    what  is  going n  in  the eal conomy c p n i in o r e because  everybody  assumes, nd  I  think robably orrectly,  at  hat  is oing  on in inancial a p c th w g f

markets  is oing  to  break he ink  etween  our  recent  nd  present  ituation    the eal conomy g t l b a s in r e and  that  n  the uture.  here  is   great ncrease  f nxiety  nd  pessimism  in  our  region.   don't i f T a i o a a I think hat  ust  ooking  t  the undamentals  ets t  the roblem.  It s ll bout roubled  inancial t j l a f g a p i a a t f markets  right  ow. n

MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman,  this  s om  Hoenig.  We  had  a  board eeting nd  I ave i T m a h done  some traveling roughout  he istrict  cently.    don't  ave  much that  s ifferent  dd  to th t D re I h i d toa our  discussion,  ybe just  omething n the  edges.  Basically, ople n  this  egion re  aware  of ma s o pe i r a the  turmoil  n  the inancial rkets,  nd  there  s   sense  of oncern  about hat  it ight  imply  for i f ma a i a c w m the  future.    did et   sense nd  specific mments to  the  effect  hat,   things  ave  settled  wn I g a a co t as h do and  the undamentals  ave  remained  reasonably  ood in  the istrict, ple ere  more f h g D peo w concerned n  August  and  early eptember  than  they re  today. hings  have  not allen  part  n i S a T f a o them  thus ar,  nd  they end o  the  view  that  hat oes  not ecessarily  ve  to appen. f a t t t d n ha h

The outlook or egional  nvestments  s  a  mixed  bag, nd  it  oes  not rovide   lot  f elp f r i i a d p a o h for he  analysis  f ational  rends. ur  contacts  n  the  energy  sector  nd  in  some areas f t o n t O i a o manufacturing  re  saying hat  hey re  pulling  ack  on  their vestment  lans. f he  cash  flows a t t a b in p I t on the  energy ide  emain  weak or  weaken further is  uarter, ey ndicate at  here ill e s r th q th i th t w b some additional llback. ere  are  a  couple  of  areas f  strength,  ough.  One is eavy pu Th o th h construction--road  struction d  so  forth--where ere  s  a  tremendous acklog ecause  of con an th i b b large iscal  xpenditures   highways  and  other  ublic  rojects.   some of he  service f e on p p In t industries,  s  full  peed  ahead  even  with he urrent  ncertainties. it i s t c u

I  want  to hare ne  anecdote. t nvolves    major  firm hat  s onstructing    office s o I i a t i c an building,  rtly  or ts  wn use.  They were  working  with  a  major nvestment  anking  firm o pa f i o i b t arrange he  financing,  d  they ad  secured   pricing  hat  as 100  basis oints  ver  some t an h a t w p o

base  rate.  ecause  of his  inancial rmoil  he nvestment  ankers ame back  and  said he B t f tu t i b c t interest  st ould  be  300  basis  oints  bove  the ase  rate.  n  the eantime  the ase  rate  ent co w p a b I m b w down  100  basis  oints,   the et  interest  st as up  by  200  basis oints.  ut  that  till rked p so n co w p B s wo out o  a  rate  f t o 7-1/2 percent  nd  the ate n their  ld ortgage  was a r o o m 8-1/2 percent. o they ecided o S d t go  ahead  full  peed  on  that  roject.  e  have  these idening  spreads,  ut he uestion  s hat s p W w b t q i w kind  of mpact  they re aving  on the  real conomy. I  would  not  draw a  conclusion  ecessarily i a h e n from  that  necdote ther  han  to  give t  o ou. a o t i t y

As far s  consumers  go,  a  lot f onsumer  lending s till ing n,  and  our  area enders a o c i s go o l are  very  much involved  ith  equity  ending t n equity  o  debt atio  f  up  to  130  percent. w l a a t r o

In  sum,  there  s oncern bout he  future  n  our egion,  nd  we sense   great  eal  of he i c a t i r a a d t uncertainty at thers  ere  have  talked  bout.  However,  the undamentals  emain  reasonably th o h a f r good.  The outlook s rospectively  mewhat mixed in  our  region,  ut  still nerally vorable i p so b ge fa on  balance.

MS. MINEHAN. This  is athy  Minehan,  Mr.  Chairman.  Let  me just  ollow p  on  Tom C f u Hoenig's omments because,  s  we see  things  ere n  the irst  istrict, re  s ome similarity. c a h i F D the i s On the  downside, ur  large anufacturers--Gillette,  roid, d  Raytheon--are  ll ssuing o m Pola an a i negative  otices  bout  their  urrent  uarter  arnings  nd  planned ayoffs.  n  the inancial n a c q e a l I f services  ndustry,   have  reports  f ome layoffs  nd  branch  closings,    Asia  largely,   the i we o s a in by Bank of oston  and  of  some small ayoffs  y  Fidelity. ere  is n  enormous amount of ear, B l b Th a f obviously  eflecting  e  Wall Street  elated  oncerns ere  in  the  financial mmunity. That  kind r th r c h co of  fear ends o  build  n  itself  d  it eems  to  be  spreading  eyond  the inancial ctor, rtainly t t o an s b f se ce through  the edia  locally.  o we are  beginning  o  hear ncreasingly  om  nonfinancial m S t i fr companies  about heir  oncerns ver,  ot ust  he resent, t  the uture  s  well. t c o n j t p bu f a

On the  other and, ust  ooking t he  financial rkets  and  talking   a  couple f  our h j l a t ma to o directors,  r hose rganizations  at  ave  cash rom  whatever  sources,  usiness  s  very ood fo t o th h f b i g this  ear.  large nsurance  ompany,  for xample, s inding  ot nly  that  he  life  nsurance y A i c e i f n o t i business  emains ery  good  but  that  pportunities  r nvestment  bound.  They have  some r v o fo i a internal sh  generation, d  do  not  have  to inance  hemselves  eavily  n  outside  arkets.  So ca an f t h i m they re  finding  he  spreads urrently   corporate  onds  and  mortgages  to  be  great argains, a t c on b b bargains  hat  hey ave  not  run  into n   long  time. t t h i a

We  are  seeing   very  strong esidential l state  arket  here. o be  sure,  onfidence  s a r rea e m T c i down, at east  ccording o  our  early  eigebook  calls, d  conditions   the  mortgage-backed l a t B an in securities  rket  certainly ll ffect  ousing  activity  entually. t  we have  not een  it ma wi a h ev Bu s happen  yet.  We  do  have  indications  at  hatever peculative mmercial  construction s th w s co wa being  contemplated  ikely  as  been  set side,  ut he  overall  conomics  of  commercial  real state l h a b t e e remain  very  good.  With no  new construction  ming on line nd  with  low vacancy  rates  nd co a a high  rents,  are  seeing    good  deal f upport  or hat  ector  s  an  ongoing  business. we a o s f t s a

In  sum,  I  ould  echo  what  Tom  Hoenig  is aying. here  is   lot f ear  nd  uncertainty, w s T a o f a but  there s ome strength  n  our egional  conomy as  well. e  are  not eeing   feedback rom i s i r e W s a f the  financial rkets;  n  fact,  e are eeing ome reasons  hy there  ight  be  a  bit  f mpetus o ma i w s s w m o i t growth  from  some of  the urrent  evelopments. c d

MR.  GUYNN. Mr.  Chairman,  this  s ack  Guynn. My  own  regional  valuation  s i J e i probably losest   Gary Stem's han  to  that  f thers  ho have  spoken  so  far.  , oo, o  not  see c o t o o w I t d and  do  not ense ny  fundamental hange  in  our egional  conomy since he  last  OMC s a c r e t F meeting. We  had  a  directors'  eting  and  we made a  number  of pecial  nquiries   a  couple f ubjects me s i on o s that  e all gree,    think,  ay be  pivotal  o  developments n  the eriod head.  Clearly, ere s w a I m t i p a th i

enormous  uncertainty d  uneasiness.    get  the mpression  hat  hat  t  s ed  more  by the teady an I i t t i i f s drumbeat  of egative  ommentary than  by  any  deterioration  fundamentals. n c i

When  we ask  about  investment  pending lans--and  e've  made calls  o  a  number of ur s p w t o key  contacts  ver  the ast  eek--not urprisingly  at  we find  s  that  here  as  been  a  fairly o l w s wh i t h decided ullback  n  export-sensitive ustries  d  companies.  The pulp aper ivision  f p i ind an p d o Georgia  Pacific  as  scaled  ack  and  is ow probably  oing  to  cancel   major  project.  teel h b n g a S producers  learly  ave  no  plans o  expand. c h t

On the  other  and,  a  major  company here  in  Atlanta, cent  Technology, s oing  full h Lu i g speed  ahead  with  a  $350  million  xpenditure  or   plant  orth f  Atlanta. at  investment  s e f a n o Th i driven y the  same fundamental hat  e have  been  hearing bout  for  everal  ears. hat  is, b t w a s y T Lucent  has  been  subject  o  a  strike  hreat  nd  wants  to  substitute  pital r abor. t t a ca fo l

We  also alked  o  some bankers n  the egion n n effort   get  some sense f  the t t i r i a to o availability redit.  ur supervision  nd  regulation ople alked  o  five r  six f he ajor of  c O a pe t t o o t m banks  that  end n atin merica, nd  the atter nfirm he  story  hat  e all ave  been  hearing, l i L A a l co t t w h namely  that  here  as  been  a  substantial  llback  n  credit en  to he ost  creditworthy t h pu i ev t m borrowers n  Latin merica.  Bill  stes as telling  this  orning  that  ome of he op  tier i A E w me m s t t borrowers  are aying  double nd  triple e ates  hat  hey ere paying efore verything  egan  to p a th r t t w b e b come unglued.  There  is ven  some pullback  n  trade ines  o  Latin merica. e i l t A

By way of  contrast,  lls  o he  major  regional  anks  in  the outheast  uggest  hat  hey ca t t b S s t t clearly  re  looking uch more  carefully  heir  ending.  e  would  characterize  at  we see a m att l W wh happening s  a  responsible owdown in  lending  o  some borrowers here  the ending tandards a sl t w l s may have  been  overly omplacent. t's  e  kind  of esponsible havior hat ne  would  expect c I th r be t o given  the urn f vents. t eans some additional ress-testing,  ing head  to  an  economic t o e I m st look a

situation  at  ight  not e  so  favorable,  t  certainly  thing  lose  o  any  rationing   credit th m b bu no c t of to legitimate rrowers. bo

Finally, hould  add  that  he  manufacturing  urvey e just  eleased  esterday, ich I  s t s w r y wh involves  nvestment  pending eports  hat  e collected   September,  hows no  clear  ew i s r t w in s n pattern.  uch spending as  been  very  heady  in his  egion or everal  ears. e  saw some S h t r f s y W slowing  early  n,  but ompared to  a  month or  two  ago, here  s o  apparent  ew trend  oward  any o c t i n n t reduction  n  investment  pending lans. o again,  e do  not ee  a  lot f  change  other  han he i s p S w s o t t continuing  neasiness  nd  uncertainty at  e've  all  een  talking  bout nd  that  ertainly u a th w b a a c continues  o e  true ere n  our  region. hank you,  Mr.  Chairman. t b h i T

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Any Board  members want  to  comment? MS. RIVLIN.  This  is lice.    would  certainly ncur ith  most  of  what  I  have  heard A I co w around  this  able. t

MR.  GUYNN. We  can  not  hear ou,  Alice! y

MS. RIVLIN.  I  will  et loser  o  the  mike and  shout! verything    have  heard round g c t E I a this  able,  f  t  an  be  called    table, nfirms hat  I hought    knew,  namely  that  he  world  s t i i c a co w t I t i very  weak and  getting aker.  We  see  enormous  risk  version  n inancial rkets ll ver  the we a i f ma a o world.  But  here  in  the nited tates  e have  general  trength  he  domestic conomy, U S w s int e especially   the onsumer  sector.  t  the  same time, here  s   great  eal f  anxiety  nd  some in c A t i a d o a evidence f  a  pullback  rom  economic  activities t ere  going  on or  were expected o  be  going o f tha w t on in  the ext  few  months. n

It eems  to  me that hese evelopments ive  us  an  enormous  chance  to et head  of he s t d g g a t curve, s  Ed Boehne suggested  arly  n  the onversation,  d  to  do  what  we can  to  keep  a  good a e i c an

thing  oing  in  this  ountry. hat worries  e most  and  I  think  orries ther eople ost  is hat g c W m w o p m t the  real eakness in  the orld  economy is ventually ing  to ffect  ur  own economy. I  think w w e go a o we should  get  ahead  of hat  y  taking  ction  s  expeditiously    we can  to ake sure hat  he t b a a as m t t U.S.  economy stays trong.  ow, we can  wait  until  ur  next eeting,  ut hat  ould  involve s N o m b t w a long  wait. he  risk  f aiting n  my view  is hat  e may be  forced nto   reactive  osition. e T o w i t w i a p Th beauty f  doing  something ight  ow is hat othing  uch is  happening. e  can  look head  as o r n t n m W a we did  before o  see ikely  eakening  in  the .S.  economy and  decide hat  to  do about t  ater, t l w U w i l but  I  think  e should ake a  prompt  downward rate ove. If e wait  to  see  what  is oing  to w m m w g happen  in  the ext  week or  two,  we might  find urselves  eacting   either  sharp rop  in  the n o r to a d stock arket  as  earnings  ome in  more gloomy or  to  a  catastrophe   the  international ne f m c on sce i Brazil r  something lse oes  wrong. So this  eems  to  me a  good  moment  to  make our ove. o e g s m

MR.  KELLEY. Mr.  Chairman,  this  s ike Kelley.   agree ith  a  great  eal ut erhaps i M I w d b p not  everything  hat  lice ivlin  ust  aid. er  analysis  f he ituation  d  that  f thers ho t A R j s H o t s an o o w have  spoken  all  eem to o in  the ame direction. at  is,  s  each  day  passes he conomy is s g s Th a t e slowing   little  re. It ertainly ems  more and  more likely  hat  ur  policy  s n  an  easing ath a mo c se t o i o p and  that  e have  further   go. But  I  have  a  concern n  that  e eased ust  6 days  ago  and  that w to i w j 1 was the irst ve we made in  a  very  long  time.  To move again o  soon  would  very  clearly t f mo s no be  a  business-as-usual ng o  do.  If e do  it,    think  e are oing  to  have  to ery areful  bout thi t w I w g v c a the  message  that  e send.  We  have  discussed  he  economy,  so  I  will ot  go  over hat  gain.  We w t n t a have  three ectors  ere, wo  of  which  look retty ch the  same as  they id wo  weeks ago.  The v h t p mu d t latter  e  the eal  conomy in  the nited  States  nd  the eal conomy around  the orld.  Some ar r e U a r e w weakening  clearly  ccurring.  he delta,   the  extent  hat  here as  been  one  in  the  last  wo iso T to t t h t weeks,  is learly  ownward. The dynamics  are  in he  credit  nd  capital rkets.  As Alice ivlin c d t a ma R

and  others  ave  suggested,  f  hose arkets  should mplode--maybe hat  s oo  dramatic   word, h i t m i t i t a but  if  hey hould eteriorate  dly--they uld  very  easily  nd  promptly ake he eal conomy t s d ba co a t t r e with  them,  and  we could ind urselves  ery  quickly  ehind he urve. f o v b t c

If he ommittee  judges hat    substantial  terioration  that  ind s   strong  r t C t a de f k i a o imminent  possibility,  n  I  think e should ct,  nd  I  would  certainly  pport hat  ction  ven the w a a su t a e though  it bviously  s ot usiness-as-usual.   if  his  ituation es  not each  that  evel  f o i n b But t s do r l o urgency,  hen  I  think  e should e  very areful  bout  our  timing.   would  be  concerned hat f  t t w b c a I t i i is ot  a  situation   ubstantial  terioration    perhaps oes  not  appear o e,  then   move right n ofs de or d t b a now would  run  the  risk  f aking  it  eem as  if  he ed  believes  hat  t ot t  rong the irst me o m s t F t i g i w f ti and  we feel he eed  to  act ery uickly  o  correct  ur  error.  f hat  ere the erception, t n v q t o I t w p I think he  market  could ightly nclude  that  he ituation    seen  by  the ed  must  be  far orse t r co t s as F w than  we thought t  as in  late  eptember  and  that  here  s ome kind  of olicy  anic r  disarray  t i w S t i s p p o a the ed. F

I  see wo  major roblems  if  hat  hould e  what  is erceived.  umber  one,   do  not t p t s b p N I believe  e got  it  rong the  first me,  nd  I  think  t  ould  be  very  destructive  d  quite w w ti a i w an unnecessary  o  convey  that  mpression  oday.  Secondly,    would  be  concerned hat  uch  a t i t I t s perception  ould nduce  the  very ype  of  financial  rket  panic hat  e are  seeking o  prevent  n c i t ma t w t i the irst ace. f e do make a  judgment  that  he  credit  nd  financial rkets  are  such  that  he f pl I w t a ma t situation   angerous  and  action s equired, ill upport  hat  udgment.  Under  those isd i r I  w s t j circumstances,   hat  s  where we are,   hink e probably hould onsider  oving more strongly if t i It w s c m than  our  usual 5 basis oints  n  the ederal  unds ate.   also hink  e should ive  very areful 2 p i f f r I t w g c consideration    what  we say  in  our ress elease.    should asically knowledge  the  risks  hat to p r We b ac t

we see  for he  economy and  make sure hat hose isks  re  what  the arket  sees s  acting  pon t t t r a m u u and  not  those hat   entioned  a  minute  ago.  Thank you. t Im

MR.  MEYER. This  is arry eyer. Let  me reinforce o  themes  that    think e have L M tw I w heard entioned  several  imes. hile there  ay be  some erosion  n the argin  in  terms f  the m t W m o m o very  near-term  utlook,  here  s ot ery  much change  in  terms f  the raditional redients  at o t i n v o t ing th go  into ur  forecast,  y  for 999,  and  no  basis here or   material  hange  in  policy.  n the o sa 1 t f a c O other and,  we have  to  contrast velopments n he  real  conomy and  those n  the inancial h de i t e i f markets.  There  is   tension  etween  them.  It ay be  that  ecent  evelopments ave  increased a b m r d h our  perception  f   wider  deterioration he  functioning   the inancial rkets  that  oes o a i t in f ma g beyond  simply he  widening  of  risk  preads ut  now includes  ndications   lliquidity--market t s b i ofi participants  t  standing  ehind  the id-ask  preads  s  wide  as  they re.  It s ery  difficult no b b s a a i v to translate  l hat  nto   revised  orecast,  t t  dds  a  higher egree f  uncertainty  d  reinforces al t i a f bu i a d o an the  sense f  downside  risks. o

With  reference  o  other orecasts,  ust  say  that  or he irst me  I  see  a  meaningful hift t f I  m f t f ti s in  forecasts r 999 after    long  period  f  little  ange.  I  think  e are  going  to ee hose fo 1 a o ch w s t forecasts nverge  down to  something loser  o  the  Greenbook,  not  to he  Greenbook  level  ut co c t t b toward  it.

My  sense  is hat  ne  of he roblems  is hat  e may not  have  conveyed  as  well  as  we t o t p t w might  have  liked  he essage  that  e wanted  to  send  at he ast  eeting. hat  message  I  thought t m w t l m T was that  e had  a  flexible licy,  recognized    significant  ange  in  the conomic  outlook, w po we a ch e and  we responded ccordingly.    think ur  action  as taken s  something  done  grudgingly,  nd  I a I o w a a believe  e might  reduce ome of hat  ncertainty    the arkets  by  taking    further tion  t his w s t u in m a ac a t point. ere we to  do so, nd  since t ould  involve  n intermeeting ve, I  would  think  hat  5 W a i w a mo t 2

basis  oints  ould be  the ight  ay to  do  it. o me,  if  he tory  s hat  e feel e need  to ave  a p w r w T t s i t w w h lower  federal  unds ate n  the irst lf  f ext ear,  t  robably ould  be  good  to et  there f r i f ha o n y i p w g a little  ster  han n the ace  we might  otherwise  e  on. In  addition, ven he  downside  risks, fa t o p b gi t I would say  that f    picked  number that    would  like or he  GDP  growth  rate  ext ear,    would i I a I f t n y I snug  it p  a  little  oser  o rend han  I  otherwise  ould  because f he revailing nse f u cl t t t w o t p se o downside  risks  nd  discontinuities. a

MR.  FERGUSON. This  is oger  Ferguson  speaking.    would  like  o  echo  and  respond R I t to  some of  what  I ave  heard n  the olicy  ssue.  ike Kelley s oncerned bout  sending h o p i M i c a a message  of  panic r  disarray   policymaking. n the ther and,  I  am actually re concerned o in O o h mo about  being erceived  s  being nactive   the  face f  what  I  think  re oing  to e  potentially p a i in o a g b rapidly  oving changes  going  forward.   have  been  struck  y some of  what  Bill  cDonough m I b M had  to  say  and  what  Larry eyer had  to  say  as  well. he financial rkets  do  seem to e M T ma b showing  signs f  a  great  eal  of ear  nd  uncertainty. ey seem actually   have  gone  beyond  a o d f a Th to state  f oncern  and  uncertainty d  to ave  seized  p in  important  ays.  There  are o c an h u w counterparties  at o  longer eem to e  standing  n  the ther ide f mportant  rades.    am th n s b o o s o i t I fairly  ertain  hat  he esult ll nevitably   some impact  on the eal conomy. The sense f c t t r wi i be r e o financial reboding  hat    have  heard,  hile t  as  not et  translated  to n  impact n  the eal fo t I w i h y in a o r economy,  will n  my view  have  such  an  impact  at ome point,  erhaps ot n  the  next eek or i s p n i w two but  certainly    the ext uarter  r  two.  We  all now that  he  policy ctions  hat  e take in n q o k t a t w require  ome time o  work their  ay through he  economy. Additionally,    a  period f reat s t w t in o g uncertainty,  hink t  s mportant  or s  to  be shown in  a  leadership le nd  one  in  which we are I  t i i i f u ro a prepared o  be  as  flexible d  as  vigilant    the arkets  and  circumstances  n he  real  conomy t an as m i t e require.  herefore,  n  terms f  what  has  brought s  here oday nd  what  is  different,  onclude T i o u t a I  c

that hat  is ifferent   hat  he arkets ave  not  moved to  support  he ind  of nvestment  r  the w d ist t m h t k i o kind  of onsumption  expenditure  hat  e need  to  maintain  rowth  as  close s  possible   trend. c t w g a to I think t s ur  obligation   be  pushing ublicly  gainst  he ignificant  wnside  risk  hat i i o to p a t s do t I believe  e face. w

I  am mindful,  s  Mike Kelley ndicated,  at  e are nvolved n n intermeeting a i th w i i a discussion. erefore,  ny  action hat  e may take  should n  my view  be  on  the rder   25 basis Th a t w i o a point ove. It  should ot e larger  ecause  we will et ore impact  out  of 5 basis  oints  n  my m n b b g m 2 p i opinion han  from  anything lse. o,  having eard  where  we are  now and sharing  he  sense hat t e S h t t adverse inancial nditions  ave  not et it  he eal conomy but  are  likely   do  so, y f co h y h t r e to m inclination  uld  be  to  take dvantage f his  eriod f  quiescence  o  indicate  hat  e are wo a o t p o t t w vigilant,  rward-looking,  d  responsible. fo an

MR.  GRAMLICH. This  is ed Gramlich.  First  n the eal conomy,  let  e focus n the N o r e m o Greenbook  forecast.  ou will ecall  hat wo  weeks ago  it  as already  eak,  and  that  as Y r t t w w w despite  he  assumption f   75  basis  oint eduction  n  the ederal  unds ate.  ow, according  o t o a p r i f f r N t Mike Prell,  hose view  is upported  y  other  omments we have  heard, t s eaker  still. ,  I w s b c i i w So think hat e could  easily  ustify  50 basis  oint  eduction  n  the unds ate. he  next  question t w j a p r i f r T is  whether e should educe  the ate  t  the ext eeting  or ow. I  guess   agree  with  a  lot  f w r r a n m n I o others,  hy not  now?  From the  standpoint   the  real  conomy,  it  robably oesn't  atter  oo w of e p d m t much; four eeks is ot  that  ong  a  period hen we consider  ll he  lags n  the eal conomy. w n l w a t i r e But  for he inancial rkets,  our eeks could  be  a  long  time, specially  r ne  key  currency t f ma f w e fo o market, he  real. o  I  come out  in  favor f oing  something ow. I  guess 5  basis oints  s kay, t S o d n 2 p i o though  I  could lso efend 0. a d 5

There  are  two  basic rguments  against  educing he ate. ne is he ncertainty  gument a r t r O t u ar and one  is he  panic rgument.  With regard o  the irst,    eems  to e that  he  uncertainty at t a t f its m t th we had  even  two  weeks  ago  is eing argely  esolved  n  the irection  did ot  want  it  o e.  I b l r i d we n t b think e are  lot  ore certain,  ybe sadder ut iser,  bout he  outlook ow than  we were  two w m ma b w a t n weeks ago. On the  panic rgument, rankly  here  s  panic lready. a f t i a

I  think  arry eyer is ight  hat ur essage  was a  bit  isinterpreted  d  that  ome L M r t o m m an s reinforcement   that  essage  may be a  good idea. f e move the ate  own today y guess  is of m I w r d m that  ur  action ould  be  calming,  ot anic-inducing. ank you. o w n p Th

MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairman,  this  s ill  oole.  As I  read he iscussion,  erybody  has i B P t d ev a  sense f oncern  about urrent  onditions. rsonally, ould  feel   lot etter  bout oving o c c c Pe I  w a b a m between  meetings,  iven ast ractice,  here  ere  a  sense f rgency  that  as a  step p from  a g p p ift w o u w u sense  of oncern. e  are  going  to  be  sending   message  by  acting  etween  meetings,  nd  I  am a c W a b a little  ncerned bout  how that  essage  is  going  to  be  interpreted. co a m

I  have  two  questions  nd  would  appreciate  ome comments on  both. irst,   we want  to a s F do ease  policy  n a  day  when we have  received  ad  PPI  news? Secondly,  s here ny  chance  that o b i t a action  oday  could e  viewed, y  some anyway,  as  an  effort   help ail ut  the  hedge  funds? t b b o b o

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let  me respond o  that,  ill. irst  f ll,  he atest I t B F o a t l PP number  is learly  significant  erration,  d  I  think he arkets nderstood  hat.  hen  the c a ab an t m u t W number  first me out  at :30  this  orning, he  bond  market  dropped  /2  point.  s soon  as  it ca 8 m t 1 A became clear hat  was causing he PI  to ise, e  market  came all  he  way back.  I  don't  hink w t P r th t t the  PPI  is n  issue.  ndeed,  here  s   certain  erversely sitive nefit  o esponding  hen the a I t i a p po be t r w numbers do  not  appear o  be  immediately  upportive  f  a  policy  hange  because hat  oes  imply t s o c t d

that e are  looking  t   broader,  ore forward-looking cture.  o today's  PI  number is ot w a a m pi S P n something   would  be  particularly cerned bout. I con a

What I  think  e have  to  focus n  here  is he ssue  f  where  we think  he unds  rate  hould w o t i o t f s be  at his  oint,  nowing  what  we know about he uture  nd  disregarding e act hat  e are  at t p k t f a th f t w 5-1/4  ercent,  f    may put  it  hat  ay. I  think t  s robably  oo  soon  for he ype  of inancial p i I t w i i p t t t f constrictions  at  ave  been  occurring  n  quite   virulent nner  in  the  last  ouple f eeks to th h i a ma c o w have  worked  their  ay through alance heets nd  into apital  nvestment  ecisions.  have  been w b s a c i d I trying  o  get  sense rom  a  number  of ifferent  ntacts  egarding  hat  is oing  on  in he eal t a f d co r w g t r economy. The  judgments  that    am hearing  rom  most  of ou that  othing uch has  changed  in I f y n m the  economy strikes  as  about ight.  hat  is,  here  s ery  little dence hat    can  detect  f n me r T t i v evi t I o a underlying  eterioration  the  economy,  and  indeed ere  we to  see  that, ould  suggest  hat  e d i w Iw t w are  right  n the dge  of  a  recession.  hen  we see evelopments f  that  ature,  t sually  s o e W d o n i u i a signal  hat  he ystem  is  breaking  own.  That  is ne  of he easons hy we often ave  difficulty t t s d o t r w h forecasting  cessions.  do  not  sense  anything  ut  there  hat eminds e of  that, d  I  do think re I o t r m an that he erception  f  a  continuing  easonably  ood  economy is  fairly jective servation. t p o r g a ob ob

However,  if  e look  at ast istory d  at hat  happens  when profit rgins  are nder w p h an w ma u some pressure  nd  financing  onditions  eteriorate  en  half  s  much as  they ave  so  far,  he a c d ev a h t presumption hat  he  capital ods  markets  can  hold trikes  as  rather  nlikely.  e  have t t go s me u W maintained    somewhat higher  ederal  unds  rate han e otherwise  ould  have  in  the ast  ear r a f f t w w l y o two,  largely   uspect  ecause e were  seeing    quite  ronounced  stock arket  wealth ffect  n Is b w a p m e o the  economy. Because  of hat  ffect,  felt  he eed  for   tighter licy  han  would  ordinarily t e we t n a po t have  been  the ase. e  purposely  llowed he eal ederal  unds  rate o  rise  s  inflation c W a t r f f t a expectations ll  argely  ecause  that  eemed to e  the  appropriate licy  osture  o  take. ut  if fe l b s b po p t B

we start  here we are  now  and  look orward,  aking ccount f  current  inancial nditions d w f t a o f co an the  developing eakening  in  profit  argins,    funds ate  n  the rea f  -1/2  to  5 percent  eems w m a r i a o 4 s close o  where  we want  it  o e  at his  tage. ut  clearly,   tart  oving  at   more dramatic ace t t b t s B tos m a p than  we need  to aises  he isk,  think, at ike Kelley uite  ppropriately  ought p. r t r I th M q a br u

My  own impression  t  this  tage s retty  uch what  Ed Boehne and  Alice ivlin a s i p m R mentioned,  amely  that  e have  a  window in  which  to djust  he  funds ate  ownward without n w a t r d being  perceived  s  moving in esponse  o  very  strong  ressures  hat  re orking  against  s  in  the a r t p t a w u economy. If e move the  funds  rate  ower, nd  frankly    would be  inclined   lower  it  oday,  hat w l a I to t t does  not ut  us  in  a  position  here, f  he ove proves rong,  there s omething hat  ould p w i t m w i s t w prevent s  from  moving back.  If n  what  I  would  at his  oint onsider  o e  a  relatively  w u i t p c t b lo probability  e inancial rkets ere  to  return  o  what  we perceived  f  as  normal  two  months th f ma w t o ago,  and  if  he conomy started   strengthen ain nd  the  stock arket  to  move higher, ere s t e to ag a m th i nothing hat  ould  prevent s  from  reversing  ur  move.  At  5  percent, r xample, f  e were  to t w u o fo e i w move the unds  rate  percentage  oint ower  today,  e would  not e  that  ar ut  of  position  n f 1/4 p l w b f o i terms  of  a  real unds ate o  address  he ow  probability   n upturn n he conomy. f r t t l ofa i t e

At  this  tage,  fter  0  years f ooking  t  the conomy on  almost   daily  asis,  must  say s a 5 o l a e a b I that    have  never een  anything  ike  he urrent  ituation. rtainly,  sed n all  he  historic I s l t c s Ce ba o t annals   have  read,  nd  I  have  done  a  good  deal f eading  n conomic  history,    ould  be  an I a o r i e itw extremely  are vent or his  ype f  financial vironment o  emerge  and  eventually   recede r e f t t o en t to without aving  any  impact  on  the conomy. Indeed,    do  not emember any  occasion hen that h e I r w occurred n  the  past. i

In  conclusion, ould  be  inclined  t his  tage  o  move the unds ate  own by 25  basis I  w a t s t f r d points.  here  is n  inclination    the art  f  a  number of oard  members to  accept he T a on p o B t

outstanding  equests  f eserve  Banks  that  ant  to  reduce he iscount  ate y  50 basis  oints. r o R w t d r b p As you know,  at  least  hose f  you  who have  been  around  for   while,  he onvention  n his t o a t c i t Committee  is  not o  vote n  policy djustments  uring ntermeeting riods.  he reason s hat t o a d i pe T i t our  directives    essence ive he  Chairman  of he  Committee,  in  consultation  en feasible th in g t t wh wi the  Committee  members,  the  authority    request  he esk to ove the  federal  unds ate. to t D m f r I would be  inclined  o  reduce he ate y  25 basis  oints  nd  would  like  o  put uch  an  action  n t t r b p a t s o the  table, t  for   vote ut o  hear hatever bjections ere  ay be  against  t.  nless   hear no a b t w o th m i U I strong bjections, ould  request  he  Desk  to  move the ate own  25  basis  oints,  nd  having o I  w t r d p a done  that    would  call    meeting  of he ederal eserve oard  to equest  pproval f  a  reduction I a t F R B r a o of  50  basis oint  n  the iscount  ate. o,   very uch would  like  o  hear esponses  o  that  unds p i d r S I m t r t f rate roposal  f    may. p i I

MR. BOEHNE. Mr.  Chairman,  this  s d Boehne. I  agree ith  your  recommendation  to i E w lower  the unds ate  y  25 basis  oints.  hink hat  he isks  re  on  the ownside  and  that  e f r b p It t t r a d w need  to  stay n or  ahead  of he urve.   also hink hat  ur  last  ove was misinterpreted. o t c I t t o m Therefore,  think our  proposal  s   good  idea. I y i a

Although  it s ot  something or he  Federal  pen Market  Committee  to  decide,    would i n f t O I like  o  express  he iew  that   50  basis oint eduction  f he iscount  ate  n  conjunction th  a t t v a p r o t d r i wi 25 basis  oint rop  in  the unds ate  s xtraordinarily  sual.   do  not  recall at  appening p d f r i e unu I th h before.  It ay be  confusing  o  the ublic.   uess   would  ask  the oard  to econsider.  agree m t p Ig I B r I that  e should ove the  discount  ate  own. It ust  eems  to e that  t  ight  make more  sense w m r d j s m i m to  reduce t  y  the ame amount  as  the  funds ate  ecause  the essage  we are  sending s hat  e i b s r b m i t w are  open  to urther clines. f de

In  sum,  I  am for he 5 basis oint  rop  in  the unds  rate,  nd  it  eems  to e that    25 t 2 p d f a s m a basis oint rop  in  the iscount  ate ould  be more consistent th hat.    would  just  sk  the p d d r w wi t I a Board  to  take hat  nto ccount. t i a

MR. KOHN. President  oehne,  you  are orrect  n  that  ost  of he ime  the  discount  ate B c i m t t r and  the  funds ate  re oved by  the  same amount.  But  actually   1990 and 1991 there  ere  five r a m in w instances  n  which the unds  rate as moved down by 25  basis  oints  nd  the iscount  ate  y  50 i f w p a d r b basis oints. o in  that  asing nvironment uch  a  disparity s not  unusual. p S e e s wa

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Bob McTeer is ext. n

MR. MCTEER. Thank you.  As you might  expect,    would  prefer  0  basis oints  oday I 5 p t rather  han 5 on the ed  funds  rate. e  have  a  Texas  country wing  band  down here  whose t 2 f W s name is  "Asleep  at he heel." I  would  hate or he inancial rkets o  give s  that  abel  s t W f t f ma t u l a well.  I  realize at    am in he  minority, t  I  thought    should xpress hat  iew. th I t bu I e t v

On the  question  f  the iscount  ate,    think  t s asily  xplained  hat  e did 5 basis o d r I i i e e t w 2 points  n the ed  funds ate ast  ime,  5 basis  oints  ore this  ime, nd  50  basis oints  n  the o f r l t 2 p m t a p o discount  ate  s  simply   catch-up.    would  strongly  gree ith our  50  basis  oints  n  the r i a I a w y p o discount  ate. r

MS. MINEHAN. Mr.  Chairman,  I  don't  ave  any  objection   the 5  basis oint h to 2 p reduction  n  the  fed unds ate.   do  think  hat overnor  Kelley's utionary  omments apply i f r I t G ca c with  particular  rce f  e move both  the iscount  ate nd  the ed  funds  rate  n  the ame day fo i w d r a f o s just    couple f eeks after  ur  earlier  tion  nd  in  the ace f  a  lot f anic n he inancial a o w o ac a f o o p i t f markets ut  evidently  ot uch  change  in  the eal conomy.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Are you  saying hat  ou think  he  discount  ate hould ot t y t r s n be  changed  at ll? a

MS. MINEHAN. I  could  agree ith  not hanging t  t ll  ecause e have  had  discount w c i a a b w rates  nd  fed unds ates  t he  same level  any times n  the ast.   could  support  educing he a f r a t m i p I r t discount  ate  y  the ame amount as  the ed  funds  rate. r b s f

MR.  PARRY. Mr.  Chairman,  this  s ob Parry.   would not  object  o  your i B I t recommendation  with  regard  o  the unds  rate.  ith  regard  o he  discount  ate,  e at ur ank t f W t t r w o B have  been  recommending to  our  directors at  hey equest    reduction  n  the  discount  ate,  hich th t r a i r w as  you  know they ave  done.

Thank  you. st i ac on I n

MR.  STERN. Mr. Chairman,  this  s ary Stern.    think e have  an opportunity  educe i G I w tor the  funds ate  nd  we should o  so.  It s ossible  hat  he  move could  be  misconstrued  y  the r a d i p t t b market, ut  it  s lso ossible  hat  e would  be  perceived  s  moving decisively. m willing  o b i a p t w a I  a t take  the isk  hat  he arket  will et t  ight. r t t m g i r

As far s  the iscount  ate  s oncerned,  or hat  it  s orth  I  would  prefer    1/4 oint a d r i c f w i w a p reduction, t  this  s ot  a  big ssue ith  me. bu i n i w

MR.  MOSKOW. Mr.  Chairman,  this  s ike Moskow.  I, oo, ould  prefer  he 5 basis i M t w t 2 point eduction  n  the  discount  ate.    would  support he roposed eduction  n  the  fed unds  rate. r i r I t p r i f

MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman,  this  s  Tom  Hoenig.  I  would  not  object  o he 5 basis i t t 2 point eduction  n  the ed unds  rate.    am uneasy  about  making  this  ove this  oon  after r  late r i f f I m s ou September  action.    don't  hink here  as  been  enough  change  since he  September  meeting o I t t h t t warrant he  rate  ut,  ut  I ertainly derstand  hat  t s n  some ways an  insurance  ction nd  I t c b c un t i i i a a would not  object.

If   may express  n  opinion n  the  discount  ate,    would  much prefer    /4  point  eduction I a o r I a1 r so  that  t  omes in he  same  as  the eduction  n  the unds  rate. hat  combination oes  not  sound i c t r i f T d

quite s  alarmist   one  involving    larger  iscount  ate. ith  reference   the  earlier  riod hat a as a d r W to pe t you mentioned, on,  I  think hose ctions  ight  have  been  justified ing  more difficult D t a m dur a period or he  economy. In  any  event,  he iscount  ate  s omeone else's ll  o ake. f t t d r i s ca t m

MR.  VARVEL. Mr.  Chairman, his  s  Walter arvel  in  Richmond.  We  have  similar t i V views.  We  would  prefer  o  see  a  reduction  t he  next egular eting. aking  the  unusual t a t r me T action  n  an intermeeting riod  ight  send  the essage  of  a  sense f rgency  that  ould ause i pe m m o u c c the  markets o  expect urther  r  greater te eductions   the ear erm  than  we might t f o ra r in n t contemplate  t  this  oint. a p

MR. JORDAN.

So the uestion  s hat  message  we want  to i o ist m q i w send  with  the iscount  ate. here  is eal ignificance    what  we do  on  the  funds ate.   don't d r T r s to r I think   /4  point  eduction  s oing o  do  a lot  f amage or  help  a  lot  ither. t  I  think  he eal a1 r i g t o d e Bu t r question  hat  ust  be  carefully nsidered  bout he iscount  ate,  hether he hange  is t m co a t d r w t c 1/4 or  /2 1 point,  s he  statement  hat  s ade about  policy  ow  and  the tatement  hat  ill ave  to  be  made i t t i m n s t w h in  a  subsequent  eriod hen the  rate  as  to e  raised  gain. p w h b a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Do any  of he  Board  members have  comments?  Governor t Rivlin.

MS. RIVLIN.  I  would  agree  with  the hairman. I  believe  e want  to  send  a  strong C w signal.    don't  hink  e should orry  about  the anic actor.    suggested  0 basis  oints  n  the I t w w p f I 5 p o discount  ate ecause   thought  t  ould give   stronger  ignal.  ndeed, f  e were  only  going  to r b I i w a s I i w do 25 on the  discount  ate,  would  be  inclined   move the ed  funds ate  y  perhaps 0  basis r I to f r b 5

MR. MEYER. I  agree ith  the 5 basis oint  ove in  the  funds  rate.  n  general    think w 2 p m I I the  discount  ate  hould e  moved in  line  ith he unds ate.   do  not hink  f  the  discount  ate r s b w t f r I t o r as  anything ther han omplementing  policy. nd since e recently  arrowed  the  spread o t c A w n between  the  two  rates  o 5 basis  oints  rom  50  basis oints,   s ery  easy  to ustify  50  basis t 2 p f p iti v j a point ove on the  discount  ate.  guess hat's  ere  I  would be. m r I t wh

MR. FERGUSON. Mr.  Chairman,  I  concur ith  your  recommendation  of   25 basis w a point  eduction  n  the unds ate.  hink e are  being reemptive nd  forward-looking  ere. r i f r It w p a h I believe  e should  take dvantage f his  indow  of  opportunity  ake that  hange  so  that  e w a o t w tom c w do  not  appear o  be  in  a  panic nd  reactive.   ill  ake ome time efore e see  the ffect   the t a Itw t s b w e in real conomy. e

With respect  o  the  discount  ate,    think  e should ry o eep  it t   certain  evel  elow t r I w t t k a a l b the  current  unds ate.  herefore,  think   50  basis  oint  ove would  be  appropriate,  t   will f r T I a p m bu I suspend udgment  and  participate   he  further scussion   that  ssue y  the oard. j int di of i b B

MR. GRAMLICH. I  think   25  basis  oint  ut n  the unds ate  s ine.  ave  this  uaint a p c i f r i f Ih q notion hat he iscount  ate hould e  above  the unds  rate,   my position   that s he  smaller t t d r s b f so on i t the  change  in he iscount  ate  he etter.  o I  prefer  ,  25,  and  50  in  that  rder or  he iscount t d r t b S 0 o f t d rate.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes. I  think  e should ust  ead he  proposed tatement w j r t s first,  st  s  it elates   the ederal  unds ate. on Kohn,  would  you  read his  nd  then ell  s ju a r to f f r D t a t u what  you  recommend on the iming?  We  have  to  go  into   Board  Meeting  to  discuss  he iscount t a t d rate.   don't  ant  to resume  where  we will ome out.  We  will bviously  ake the I w p c o m announcement  after  he  Board  meeting. t

MR.  KOHN. This  is   draft, .  Chairman. Obviously e can  fine-tune  fter  he a Mr w ita t discussion, t  the eart f t  ould  be  "The  Federal eserve oday  announced  the ollowing bu h o i w R t f policy  ctions:  he Board  of overnors  approved  a  reduction  n he  discount  ate  rom  5  to a T G i t r f either  3/4  r  4-1/2  percent, pending  on  what  the oard  decides. e federal  unds  rate  s xpected 4o de B Th f i e to  fall  5  basis  oints  rom  around 2 p f 5-1/4 percent  o  around  5 percent." here  are  then wo t T t explanatory  entences:  Growing caution  y  lenders  nd  unsettled nditions   financial rkets s " b a co in ma more generally  re ikely  o  be  restraining  ending nd  damping inflation  essures  n  the  future. a l t sp a pr i

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. We  can  close he OMC t F meeting  with  a  decision  hat  he t t Desk will e  requested  o  lower  the unds ate  y  25 basis  oints.  e  will mmediately o  into b t f r b p W i g a Board  meeting  and  hopefully  ake a  reasonably  uick ecision.  on Kohn, what  is he m q d D t appropriate me  for elease? ti r

MR.  KOHN. I  think  or he iscount  ate  here  s  no set ime.
