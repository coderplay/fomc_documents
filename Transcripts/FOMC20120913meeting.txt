a staff report will lead, but Vice Dudley would like to introduce the other presenter. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good morning, everybody.  Our first item is on the potential effects of large-scale asset purchases.  Seth Carpenter Chairman

I actually had the interesting experience of writing a paper on the the financial crisis, along with Jennifer Roush.  I am not really I managed to do that during that period, but, obviously, Jennifer and Michelle did most coauthor. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I would like to introduce Michelle Ezer from the Markets Group.  Michelle and case for TIPS, right in the heart of sure how of the work.  So she is a

I will discuss some considerations about how discuss the balance sheet and income implications, along with the issues.

economic effects of LSAPs, the staff analysis a term structure model that embeds Treasury and MBS supply factors as the yield curve.  These effects depend on market participants' beliefs of the SOMA portfolio's holdings of securities and the yield pass through roughly one-for-one to other market rates.  In addition, rate reduces the discount factor in pricing equities, boosting stock LSAPs that the changes in these market variables are used to simulate FRB/US model. When considering the financial and starts from determinants of about the entire trajectory types of those securities.  The FRB/US model assumes that declines in the 10-year Treasury the lower Treasury prices.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar falls as well.  For include purchases of MBS, there is an additional assumed reduction in MBS and mortgage rates.  Finally, the macroeconomic effects of these purchases using the

For example, frictions like capacity for originations may prevent mortgage rates from fully adjusting, at least concerns the embedded effects on foreign exchange value of the dollar.  Some event studies of balance sheet actions point to smaller effects than are calculated using the FRB/US model, and other models would of In short, while the projections assessment, the effects are clearly subject to considerable for-one pass-through from the 10-year Treasury misstate the connection restrictions in the short run.

MBS should, in principle, put and, so, stimulate the economy. MBS have a somewhat smaller effect on most longer-term interest rates, they have somewhat effects on mortgage rates, and when translated into estimated macroeconomic are fairly small, especially relative to the substantial guidance regarding the allocation of LSAPs between purchases of MBS. Buying either longer-term Treasury securities or downward pressure on longer-term interest rates Although staff models suggest that purchases of than Treasury purchases larger outcomes, the differences uncertainty that surrounds such estimates.  As a result, the staff memos did not provide clear longer-term Treasury securities and purchases of first exhibit, to illustrate the macroeconomic effects that are that the Committee instead ends the MEP and purchases $600 MBS by late next year.  That's option 1 as in the staff memo and it's the dotted blue line.  In addition to from LSAPs, this option is also assumed to put downward LSAP program is projected to boost real GDP, lower the concluded that the purchases under discuss some of the anticipated effects of the program on the Looking at your implied by the staff models, we compare a projection in which the MEP, the Maturity Extension Program, is continued as planned-the solid, dark blue line-to a projection that assumes billion in Treasury securities and $400 billion in labeled lowering term premiums pressure on longer-term rates by pushing off the first increase in the federal funds rate by about six months.

This confidence effect is not captured in the staff projections but could be important.  Alternatively, if the stopping rule is not clear, and the public believed that the Committee might stop purchases somewhat earlier than the Committee actually intended, then the interest rate effect public came to understand the Committee's stopping rule, the expected size of the SOMA portfolio would revise up, and the interest rate effects would become larger. Michelle is now going to discuss the related to the exit.

Thanks, Seth.  As Seth mentioned, I will be discussing the balance LSAP options memo and associated exhibit 2, you can a result of the asset purchases.  Consistent with the exit principles, we 6 months prior to the first increase in the target federal funds rate, mature without reinvestment, and 6 months after that first agency securities begin.

Turning to the top-left panel of see the path of the portfolio under a baseline scenario in which MEP is completed and options 1 and 4 from the memo.  Under the latter two options, the portfolio grows significantly as assume that securities are allowed to increase, sales of portfolio through time.  The addition of a new time between the start of example, under option 1 it takes 41 months for the portfolio size to normalize after the initiation of MBS sales.  This is 6 months longer compared with scenario.

lower than in a scenario with no additional LSAP.  The capital losses from Looking at the top-right panel, until 2016, remittances are higher under LSAP scenarios, because of the higher interest income from the larger portfolio as a result of capital losses.  Under option 1, annual remittances deferred asset is created. In terms of Federal Reserve income, cumulative remittances to the Treasury over the projection period are lower remittances reflect higher interest expense and the larger MBS sales. the and minimal additional interest expense.  Thereafter, income is lower higher interest expense and larger are projected to bottom out near zero.  By contrast, under option 4, remittances fall to zero for more than 5 years, and a

Of course, income and balance sheet projections can be sensitive to interest rate projections, and those projections are subject to uncertainty.  One gauge of the

risk in the portfolio is presented in the middle-left panel.  Here, we an assumption that rate and 10-year Treasury yield are persist for the all of the LSAP options shown, the higher would cease for a considerable number of years, and a substantial interest rate present the projections of Federal Reserve remittances under 1 year after federal funds liftoff, the federal funds 100 basis points above the baseline levels, and these higher levels remainder of the projection period.  Under interest rate paths result in a period of no remittances to the Treasury and the creation of a deferred asset, as shown in the middle-right panel.  Under option 4, remittances to the Treasury deferred asset would be created.

First, as shown in the bottom panel, the level of reserves would be at the time of the first increase in the federal funds rate.  Second, in order to or other changes to the exit strategy, anticipated by the exit strategy principles. The portfolio projections highlight two implications that an LSAP may have on the exit strategy. higher remain consistent with the existing exit principles, MBS sales would need to take place over a shorter period than 5 years-the period currently assumed in the projections.  Absent a shorter MBS sales period, the size of the portfolio would not normalize within 2 to 3 years of the initiation of asset sales as federal funds rate-about $1 trillion expected under the current policy, and also $1 trillion larger than assumed IOER rate will raise short-term market rates by a closer connection between the rates, of reserves. Additional $1 Trillion LSAP on the Exit will used in Starting with the first point, under option 1, reserve balances will be about $2.3 trillion at the time of the first increase in the larger than in June 2011.  While increasing the itself, reserve-draining tools can help to ensure and greater use of these tools may be needed, given the increased quantity The memo entitled 'The Effect of an Strategy' discussed the status of each of the different draining tools.  However, it is too early to provide specific details of a draining plan, because such a plan depend on how markets evolve and the lessons learned once these tools are large scale.

Under option 1, by reducing the 3½ years from the 5 years assumed in making the projections, The staff average pace of MBS sales would likely be years and create a deferred asset.  In contrast, assumptions need to be altered under a $2 trillion alone would not be enough to normalize 2 to 3 years of the initiation of asset sales in this Moreover, sales of securities in the volume envisioned under option 4 over a Turning to the second point, the exit strategy principles themselves will not have to change as balance sheet would be normalized within 2 to 3 years of depending on the size of period of asset sales to the portfolio size would normalize within the assumed 2 to 3 years. currently believes that the faster manageable from a market-functioning perspective.

any event, the Committee may wish to review its exit principles periodically, LSAP program, where the relying on asset sales as a tool to drain reserves, for example, by security sales.  Asset sales could current exit strategy principles remain will be useful to determine whether alternate strategies happy to any questions. In particularly if the Committee implemented a flow-based ultimate size of purchases would be unknown.  Adjustments to the principles could include more heavily expanding it to include a moderate pace of Treasury also occur sooner.  On balance, although the valid, additional analysis might prove more helpful.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Seth and I will be answer been doing on all aspects of asset purchases.  You have received a me now open the floor in case there are any for staff.  President Plosser. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  Of course, this is just a summary of a lot of work that the staff has number of memos.  Also, let me just mention that a little bit later this morning we will talk about the consensus forecast, which gives, in more detail, the staff projections of the effects of programs of different sizes on the economy.  Let questions

all of the good summary of the uncertainties and the range and assumptions that are needed to I want to focus on two things. MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have two questions.  I appreciate work that went into this.  It has been quite helpful to me in thinking about what is going on.  Seth has made a get the point estimates.

you mentioned, Seth-that the pass-through from the you alluded to, that there is more segmentation across duration than there is across of the models.  So one question I have would be, suppose that actually Treasuries were a better substitute for 10-year Treasuries than mortgage-backed your analysis of these effects?  That is one question. One has to do with the assumptions about market segmentation and pass-through.  In some sense, the FRB/US assumes-as reduction of Treasuries to corporate and mortgage-backed securities is one-for-one, which suggests, as asset classes, in the case there was more segmentation across asset classes than across the term structure?  In other words, if 5-year securities or corporate bonds are for 10-year securities-which is the way it is kind of structured in the model-how would that change

September 12-13, 2012

assumptions that are made and the yet what we really got, at the end of the day, were some point estimates.  So if likely to be?  Can we tell the difference, given the uncertainties is your assessment of that?  So those are the two I have. And the second question is, you talked about the uncertainties, and I had to push you and I wanted to think about standard errors on these point estimates, how big do you think they are truly among these different strategies?  What questions

The first question, what if there were more segmentation maturities?  I think pretty clearly what you would see in that case effect on Treasury yields if we are buying Treasuries, and that would yields and widen the spread relative to other asset types.  And to the you would get a way it would go. MR. CARPENTER.  Okay. across asset types than across is that we might have an tend to push down Treasury extent that it's other interest rates that have a direct effect on economic activity, smaller effect.  So I think, in principle, that's the got to be a little bit of that going on.  And we sent around said we might get to the point you are buying so much that you are dislocating the Treasury curve from the rest of I think we are very sensitive to that possibility, and I think the staff we haven't gotten to that point.  And I think some of the other studies of work also point to pretty substantial spillovers to other asset classes-some a lot about, especially if the purchases were so are The hard part there, I think, is there has clearly the previous memo about market functioning that where market interest rates. conclusion so far is that LSAPs and how they Fed studies and some academic studies.  So I think that's a reasonable hypothesis to maintain-I think it's something that we will want to worry large that they were to somehow disrupt market functioning.  But my reading so far is that we not there yet, for some of those reasons.

September 12-13, 2012

you go back to some of the previous LSAPs-as the we are buying, there have been some pretty adjustments in interest rates at different points along the curve.  This suggests that the a lot, is coming through in some of was going to be, we saw some movements of yields at the long end think some of the reaction to the MEP caused us to feel a little bit better rate, once you control to conform reasonably well with some of the interest rate models that Another reason is-especially if Desk has made clear what segment of the market clear maintained hypothesis that we have, that the maturity matters the event studies.  When the Desk helped the market understand exactly what the maturity distribution of purchases relative to the belly of the curve that suggest that people see this sort of segmentation across maturities.  In addition, I about that assumption.  The movement in the short rate relative to the long for expectations, seemed we have.

you would get a widening of spreads, and to the extent that aren't the thing that matters for economic activity, you would get less of an effect. you were to do mortgage-backed securities purchases, and the same you'd get a bigger effect just on the MBS rate, and as well.  And so the scenario you bring up might be an argument for this asset types, then buying both Treasuries and MBS may be a good thing to rates, instead of relying on the purchases yields along with it. So I think the short answer is Treasuries On the other hand, if hypothesis came up, then presumably presumably mortgages having both asset classes-an argument that we didn't cover in the memo.  If there is segmentation across do, because then you will be able to affect both of those of Treasuries to also push down mortgage and MBS

buying MBS-let's say, even if it might help the mortgage market.  You don't have any whether that pass-through to corporate and other asset classes is either differential or MR. PLOSSER.  To interrupt just a second on that point, though, that begs the question about evidence on

September 12-13, 2012

Are you assuming that other asset classes the same or less than it would be with Treasuries? would follow the same amount then, in that kind of story?

we hypotheses.  Our you asked, including, if there is a of pass-through would there be?  But the models that we have, and the it might be an argument for buying two different types of assets that we MR. CARPENTER.  Right.  So I was trying to go into the counterfactual world where are assuming this asset segmentation.  And so there, there are lots of other models sort of-and they are empirical models, where we get the results based on actual datasuggest that the purchases of MBS do have the same general effect on longer-term interest rates by pulling out the longer-term assets and pushing things down.  If we had a different model, we would have to confront all of those same questions that segmentation, what sort estimation that we have done, suggest that we are getting more or less the same effect on longerterm rates of MBS and Treasuries.  I was just saying, in the alternate version of the world, where there is a segmentation, didn't discuss in the memo.

good one, and it is hard.  There are from the FRB/US model.  But there is get these effects.  I think we feel pretty good that we know results, though, for different-sized LSAPs in the memos, as Michelle $2 trillion.  I think we can't say with any confidence that $1 trillion one does more, but those are so close to each other that I don't have Your second question about standard errors is a really lots of different models that we have coming together, and I think Dave can probably speak really knowledgeably about the standard errors, especially layering, model upon model, to try to for sure the sign of the first derivative, which is in what direction these things would happen. We presented a lot of pointed out-$750 billion, $1 trillion, we know the difference between a $750 billion LSAP and a $1 trillion LSAP.  We are pretty sure we know that the

September 12-13, 2012

I see, but I don't you want to talk about the macro effects. much confidence in being able to differentiate.  It's that sort of uncertainty know if

$750 billion and $1 trillion, let's just take one of them, the $1 trillion one.  And you two years?  Was that it?  I number was, can you give me a standard error MR. PLOSSER.  I'm sorry.  Just to push it just a little bit.  So rather than the difference between estimate, what was it, 62 basis points on the unemployment rate after can't remember the exact number.  Whatever that on that point estimate?

I'm going to come to that directly.  First, just to reiterate what extent that you think that the pass-through from buying into corporate bond yields, stock market prices, the exchange rate, and things like model simulations, you are going to get smaller results. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. Seth said, your logic is correct.  To the Treasuries that, are less than in the pass-through effects that we have in there-as we have 2009-are highly uncertain.  And as time has has gone down is the concern about whether would have any effect.  At least we now think they have an effect.  But having said still much uncertainty around these estimates. Second, I agree with Seth that the been saying right from the start back in 2008, early gone on, I think the one source of uncertainty that purchases that, there is

coming up with a confidence interval, I can't do that, but I can say things that I think are helpful.  First, take the model that Min Wei and Li developed that we are mainly using for pricing the effects on Treasuries and MBS. does not have tight said, we think the be somewhat smaller or somewhat bigger?  Yes. it could be bigger is, if you go back to the first LSAP, the event studies In terms of actually the following qualitative Canlin Now, that model kicks out a standard error.  I don't know what it is, but it error bands.  There is considerable width to the confidence intervals.  That number is reasonable.  But could the number One point on why

September 12-13, 2012

yields by 100 basis points.  In the analysis that they are not necessarily taking suggested the LSAP might have lowered Treasury Min and Canlin are doing, it's 50.  So that's an example, where the highest-side estimates.

are other studies that suggest that we could be getting lower effects on financial some things, such as potential pass-through to house prices; it has no effect in the simulations.  And, there are you knew what the financial effects would be, for the economic effects.  I don't have them generated confidence bands for FRB/US impulse responses are a lot like those in other models.  They are fairly significant around what effect would be.  The effect could be considerably closer to zero, or it that, for a given LSAP, the point estimate is a half a percentage point for the way we are scoring alternative B. is certainly inside the 70 percent confidence interval. Yes.  That would be inside the 70 percent.  So There markets than in the FRB/US analysis.  On the other hand, FRB/US ignores the confidence effects that Seth alluded to.  Even if there would still be a substantial confidence interval off the top of my head, but we have over the years.  They the unemployment rate could be bigger.  Let's say on the unemployment rate after three years-that's true Could it be a quarter?  Yes.  A quarter Could it be three-quarters of a percentage point? that's just saying what, I think, everyone agrees upon: there are very wide confidence intervals on these effects.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher.

I was listening to Seth's disclaimers at the beginning, it sort of These are the risks, et cetera.  And the papers good.  The paper you particularly referenced had a lot of disclaimers in it. I am interested in seeing vetted more thoroughly is the degree to which this exit when we decide to exit. MR. FISHER.

There are lots of It seems to me that the proponents of an extended LSAP would from a signaling channel perspective that one of its benefits is that it is effective I am concerned about-and I am interested in hands of our successors, or if not tie-maybe It strikes me that the stronger the recovery-that is, the more rapidly we achieve I thought the papers touched on that, particularly the paper you referred I think it would be helpful, Mr. Chairman, if we got a better sense of what complexities Just a comment. It seems to me one of the virtues of, particularly, 'The Effect of an LSAP on the Exit Strategy' quotes in there that are qualified. take a view precisely because it makes it more difficult to either raise short-term interest rates or shrink the balance sheet for some time.  And in a way, what learning more-is the degree to which we tie the that is too strong a word-we tangle their hands, and how much more difficult the exit strategy becomes. equilibrium interest rates-the harder it is going to be for us to exit.

How we do it is not yet, for a variety of reasons.  But we would have had to write a very, very was some risk to the conduct of monetary execute the exit strategy. financial markets as well anybody think that if we Committee wants to tighten monetary policy, the staff would not be able to follow through on that?

FISHER.  You point out in the memo that there is a learning process of the different tools that might be used.  But before proceeding.

MR. CARPENTER.  Absolutely.

MR. FISHER.  Yes, sir.

I want to follow up on one point because it also relates to what accommodative can have a big effect on some of the we score things-and I think I threw out a half a percentage point a into account this additional signaling effect about the future path of the you potentially can get.  There is some evidence from the event studies that you it with the first two LSAP programs-that by announcing a program, you are also you are going to be more willing to keep rates lower for longer. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. President Plosser was talking about.  I think, whether it is connected to fear that we won't be able to exit or whether it is a signaling that the Committee is willing to be more persistently out in the future, those policy expectations results.

Does the FRB/US model allow isolate the kind of intermediate estimates-that might be levels-that fit between lower interest rates and GDP growth, so that sense of the transmission mechanism working through the model?

You can snip certain transmission mechanisms and see what it if you just zero it out.  We have done experiments like that, and what it Treasury yields, if it doesn't go out into any other asset it goes into the stock rates.  So you can think of it as three channels:  cost model says each of those is worth roughly a you didn't believe one of the channels was operating, or you MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. does to the total effect shows is, roughly speaking, changing prices, doesn't do anything in the model, to a first approximation.  What matters is that it goes into private long-term interest rates, like MBS and corporates; second, that market; and, third, that it goes into exchange of capital, wealth effects, and exchange rate.  The third of the overall effect.  So if

September 12-13, 2012

only half as effectively as it usually does, you could then scale the thought it was operating numbers down with that rough math.  And that would be approximately correct.  But in terms of what it implies for bank lending, or something like that, no, the model doesn't-

Because housing is at such an extraordinarily low percentage of GDP, in essence, that historical correlation has source of hardly results that Seth was showing and that were that very important sense, an attenuation of the effectiveness of monetary policy, whether it's conventional or unconventional right now.

Bullard. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  President you, Mr. Chairman.  I just wanted to follow up on this issue models.  If you going to get very wide confidence intervals.  But on MR. BULLARD.  Thank about confidence intervals.  In figure 1, there would be data uncertainty; there would be uncertainty about transmission channels; there would be uncertainty about layered all of that together, you are

2, where we are looking at the SOMA holdings, there we can sort of mechanically map is some uncertainty based on interest rates, and I just want to be clear on this:  This is much more solid, I would say, than page 1, what the effects might be.  Is that a fair exhibit out, more or less, what is going to happen.  There so on, but which is very uncertain and very speculative about assessment?

Our portfolio projections depend importantly on the interest rate assumptions that we made about the timing of liftoff and the MBS portfolio.  But since you are assuming that you are going to get your holdings of agency securities over a set period of time, it is just going to change kind fiveMS. EZER. assumptions that were provided, so those confidence intervals will feed through into our projections when it comes to things like Federal Reserve income over time.  When it comes to, say, the top-left panel, the path of the portfolio over time, the confidence interval is probably a little bit smaller, provided that the strategy used for exit remain constant.  There the confidence band would be in your projections for prepayments on your rid of of the wiggles in how MBS declines over that period.  But we would still eliminate it over a year period with confidence.

As far as I know, the Committee as a possible political firefight to bring that into option 1, if I'm reading this correctly, would bring the MR. BULLARD.  Just one other comment, Mr. Chairman.  On exhibit 2, panel 4, 'Deferred has never used the deferred asset.  It strikes me play.

MR. POTTER.  That's correct.

MR. BULLARD.  That might be a hard story to tell when the time comes.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman, you have a two-hander?

confidence intervals on interest rates are you are not going to know what the trajectory of short-term rates is going to be or the yield curve.  And, in fact, you are probably even more uncertain about the shape of curve because you have never gone from purchasing all of these assets to selling all of VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes.  I think the going to be almost proportionate to the confidence intervals on the real economy variables, because shape of the the yield these assets.  So we don't really know how the market is going to react to that.

I just want to note very briefly is a lot of this also depends on what going back to.  And the presumption of the staff memo is you might decide, as you go through this, that IOER works pretty well.  And you might actually want to go back to a floor system that you quite a bit more discretion in terms of how your exit actually works.  And that The second thing monetary framework you are actually that we are going back to a corridor system.  But maybe would allow would feed into a lot of these projections.

all of the work did to help prepare us for this meeting, including the work on LSAPs, but also work on other IOER.  So we appreciate it very much.  Let me turn to item 2 and call on Simon Potter CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Again, I want to thank the staff for you tools like to discuss financial developments.

As Steve will discuss, the improvement, such as it is, partly reflects a somewhat less worrisome situation in Europe than we had previously believed.  As we described in the Tealbook, even after factoring in the disappointment that we think would ensue from the conclusion of this meeting, we judge that stock prices would remain on a slightly higher trajectory and the previous projection.  These small positive influences are only partly offset by increase in oil prices, part of which may itself reflect the improvement in sentiment related to the crisis in Europe.

KAMIN.  In 1972, when Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai was asked what he thought was the historic impact of the 'It's too soon to tell.' the European Central Bank's plans to intervene in peripheral debt markets seem hopelessly premature.  And yet, as Simon has described, anticipations of aggressive ECB action have substantially brightening governments enter into an As described in its announcement last week, the ECB plans to purchase sovereign debt on the secondary market, provided that the beneficiary arrangement with the region's financial backstop facilities and agree to policy conditionality.  Although the ECB will be announcing neither a target ceiling for yields on peripheral debt nor the amounts it intends to purchase, it has signaled a more aggressive and sustained program than its earlier forays into bond markets.

Second, and as a related matter, by taking sovereign bonds hands of private investors, ECB purchases may create room in those investors' portfolios for new issues, thereby improving the

In consequence, it is more likely, though far from certain, that Spain and/or so adverse that further pronounced than we assumed in the are anticipating that, barring further adverse shocks, European of normalization.  However, we are out of the woods.  In the near term, European leaders still required of governments benefiting from the facilities and ECB intervention, and that could be contentious. and EU officials are currently assessing the status of Greece's October and postpone more difficult With markets figuring in brighter prospects for official support, financial stresses over the next several months are likely to be less July Tealbook, and we markets could soon begin the long, slow process still very far from being need to work out the conditionality to be financial rescue Additionally, IMF struggling adjustment program-although Greece's official creditors are expected to approve a much-needed disbursement by decisions until later, this is not assured, and a messy Greek exit from the euro area at this time could be quite dangerous.

Accordingly, market confidence likely can cut their budgets, improve that could take a number easing of financial stresses, combined with some Tealbook.  Even so, in our recovers only very weakly thereafter. In consequence, economic activity in Europe is also likely to remain subdued for some time to come.

The second category of information that it builds in is that we had one of our seasonal adjustment experts, Charlie Gilbert, take a mind of trying to discern downdraft in employment in 2008 and 2009, and to advise us on the extent to which those timing effects may have bled into seasonal factors, causing published estimates of job growth around the turn of the analysis of weather you will recall, an year, and there was some speculation that that may have shifted effects are pretty small, but they're included The third type of information that's built in is a regression-based effects.

You're confused at year with two geriatric dogs and other things, but I want to comment on the fact MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I actually drove back from our western symposium this that driving across the state of Nebraska, what struck me was the drought and the corn crops and just how dead the entire state of Nebraska looked, at least from Interstate 80.

Can you just walk me through those linkages-this is clearly a a drought-and how much then it feeds into other things that matter that You made some reference to the drought and the corn crop, and I remember reading somewhere-I couldn't find it in my searching-about GDP this quarter and next.  And I'd like to hear effects were; the ramifications of those effects, of forecast to your employment forecast, for example, through an Okun's law measure because GDP is lower; how much impact dissipates through your classic supply shock of we look at a lot for monetary policy?

we had built in some quantity-related effectsmay be doing something a little more systematic, out walking in the July projection. MR. WILCOX.  So I'll take a first crack at it and invite my other colleagues to jump in with additional information.  We thought in July about $10 billion is my recollection-on farm output.  This time, based on USDA assessments of field conditions-people fields with their clipboard and so forth to look at corn yields; corn is one of the crops that is most affected-we think that it's about a $30 billion hit to real farm output this time, so substantially bigger than what we had built into the to show up mostly in a decumulation of inventories in the third way that inventory arithmetic works, the hit to GDP growth is going to got the same rate of inventory decumulation built effect we've penciled in is zero in the fourth quarter.  We also think there will be a We think that that's likely and fourth quarters.  The be concentrated in the third quarter.  We've into the fourth quarter, but because it's the same rate of decumulation in both quarters, the on GDP growth small additional negative effect on agricultural exports as well, so that's where in terms of the GDP accounting-

Yes, 0.8 percentage point.  That's what I thought I remembered. MR. PLOSSER.

going to be a transitory supply shock and year, our planning assumption has been, crop yields are going to come back to normal. in annual data, it would be perfectly clear that it would happen in 2013.  However, the close contact with them, is to smooth that four quarters of the calendar year, so that snap back to normal crop yields, basically assumption, occurs in the first quarter.  So we're mimicking the algorithm in packing in the return to a normal level of GDP in the first quarter of 2013. pretense that anybody actually knows that that's the way the corn plants going to grow in 2013.  That's just the BEA methodology.  I wouldn't have anything better to I were in their shoes. MR. WILCOX.  We think-we hope-that's that next Now, there's sort of a philosophical question about when that actually occurs.  If we were operating way that the BEA does it, and we've been in very through the at this point, of course, by BEA's That's not based on any are suggest to them if a much smaller effect because prices are up nominal farm income are much less real output.  We think that there's likely to be very little effect on we've made the assumption that employers are going to smooth through course, if there was some effect on things like I think that's going to be lost in the estimate it. Now, farm proprietors' income actually sees and there's crop insurance, and so the implications for severe than they are for employment because this transitory effect.  I wouldn't be surprised, of farm equipment manufacturers and that sort of thing, but noise in terms of our ability to actually

I suspect our output gap will be a little wider over the year, and then it will just come back in the first quarter of 2013.  Is that right, MR. WILCOX.  Mechanically, second half of this Bill?

Because annual basis, we didn't for the effects of the drought.  I would say that in terms of when we look at relationships and thinking about the path of the unemployment rate, we did the drought from potential in that equation.  So we didn't want the drought to affect the unemployment rate forecast.

But just thinking back to how we thought about land values in the concentrate in commercial real estate and even some of the subprime exposures, the point at which to know when to take signal from some of those things is very difficult, notwithstanding supervisors and others December and beyond, looking at where these trends are colleagues?  [No none, on the agenda, we have an opportunity for participants who want Vice Chairman, if you'd like to CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Any other questions for our response]  Okay.  Seeing to raise questions or issues related to financial stability.  And start off.

were in Basel over I have to say that there was a pretty strong sense of unanimity that what the the best that they could accomplish, given the various constraints under VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you.  Governor Yellen and I the weekend, and ECB did was essentially

The fact that the purchases could be unlimited means that the an effective backstop, and the fact that the ECB will bondholders is important because it really will reduce the pressures on there may be private holders, if they view this as credible, who will yield curves very, very steep. which they were program has the potential for actually being be pari passu with other private holders.  So in effect, actually want to invest in these sovereign instruments for a carry trade because the in these countries, of course, are also a bit of carrot now to incent proper actions by the government.  So if you do and we will hold down your debt service cost.  And I don't was that carrot before, so I think that's pretty significant.  I think that the ECB has as long as the countries do the right thing.  And in addition, direction toward the entire euro zone, so such purchases 1 vote, with only Weidmann of the opposition is So that's the good news. There's the right thing, we will intervene think there essentially put on the table something that could take the risk of an interest rate-debt servicefiscal deficit spiral a bit off the table if these purchases do, in fact, materialize, I think this does push you in the further fiscal union.  After all, the ECB is backstopped by will increase the joint and several nature of the union.  And finally, I thought the other thing that was noteworthy about the ECB action was that it was a 22 to Bundesbank dissenting.  Given the fact that the German political leadership, at least for now, seems to be supporting the ECB actions, this means that the Bundesbank's somewhat marginalized at this point.

First, the ECB program would only activate if the with the euro group, and already we're hearing signs that Despite this, I don't think we should kid ourselves.  I think the situation remains very tenuous despite the ECB's supports.  I'd be, probably, slightly darker than Steve's comments on this.  Several issues worth highlighting: countries actually negotiate an MOU Spain seems to be reluctant or slow in terms of pursuing it.  In fact, the Spanish may decide that

September 12-13, 2012

effective even if they don't seek an MOU.  That seems like a highly risky And, third, it's going to take a while for this all to be a little bit the backstop might be strategy, but it is something that they might decide to do.  Second, the program obviously will only continue if they stay on the program. implemented because the MOU has to be negotiated with the euro group, and all of the finance ministers have to agree, and several parliaments actually have to approve the MOU.  So this idea that this is going to be happening very, very quickly-I think the market is probably ahead of itself in terms of how quickly this will come into play.

buy things, but you still have quite a bit of bad feedback loop from the austerity programs to the economy, to we're actually going in terms of the ultimate So this is a very important best that they could possibly do, and the good they're going to go along. Other issues-the ECB program will not necessarily crowd in investors, because it's not clear how long this is going to last.  So you might risk.  You still have a very fiscal performance, and the state of the banking system.  This doesn't take any of that off the table, and there's still no road map as to where destination:  What does greater fiscal union in Europe look like? thing that the ECB has done.  I think they did the thing is they put the problem back in the lap of the governments, where it belongs.  They have done what they can do now, and now it's up to the governments to decide, both in the core and in the periphery, if countries are unwilling to be fears that this will undermine the effort.  The positive, affirmed commitment is limited to €190 billion-that's it, and so that's sort of The basic model, though, of this whole situation hasn't changed.  Countries have to show they're on a sustainable path to regain market access.  The core explicit about the level of support because of constitutional court decision in Germany today, which was actually mostly that the German significant.

September 12-13, 2012

of the German Constitutional Court to be explicit does create way to go, and we backstop Spain and Italy, and the ECB support are still a lot of questions I think the unwillingness uncertainty that makes progress more difficult.  So we do still have a long don't have big, solid backstops to absorb shocks or support confidence.  The ESM-EFSF resources are still very much too small to credibly may be too uncertain as to its sustainability.  So it's progress, but there on the table.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Rosengren.

We've had an SEC proposal that wasn't proposed, and was wondering about your perspective looking at Europe, where there's more than $1 trillion of and they have a mix of floating and fixed NAVs.  I don't know how much you spent looking at the European money market funds, but I'd be interested in your forward movement.  And then the second question is, given that they have from the European money market fund MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you for the I do appreciate the monitoring that They both relate to money I money market funds time perspective on the industry's concern with the floating NAV, which seems to have been successful in stopping both floating and fixed NAVs in Europe, and the deposit rate went down to zero, is there anything to infer about interest on excess reserves experience with the deposit rate going to zero?

LEHNERT. Are those questions you'd like me to answer?  [Laughter] MR. MR. ROSENGREN.  If not here, at another time.

But basically, at the if it floats up and down a bit, it's not the end of the world.  And, of experience highlights that, although presumably their tax treatment might be slightly different.

a break for lunch?  When we about the experimental consensus forecast, and then we'll go to the don't we reconvene at 1 o'clock? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Why don't we take come back, I'll talk briefly economic go-round.  Why

[Lunch recess]

Why don't we re-commence?  Please feel free to finish fruit or your cookie.  I'll provide the entertainment here.  [Laughter]  I'd like to talk for just the latest iteration of the experimental consensus forecast.  You have a with that title.  It proceeded in the same way as in previous iterations:  The staff sent out about a week in advance and received your comments.  We also this time of having the SEP.  So using all that, we came up with the forecast CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. 6 your a few minutes about handout a preliminary Tealbook forecast had the benefit that's shown in table 1 on page 1, and which is diagrammed in exhibit 1 on page 4.

September 12-13, 2012

Tealbook, this forecast or projection is conditioned on no change in policy.  That conditioned on the August policies of continuing the MEP and late 2014 guidance. the July-August consensus, which is shown not inconsistent with the comments that came I want to come back to that number in a moment.  The unemployment and inflation numbers pretty similar, and if you care to look at the figure, you'll see that the trajectories are very relative to the standard errors. Like the is, it's Generally speaking, the data are quite similar to immediately below.  One exception is the 2013 real GDP forecast on the very first line, 2.2 percent, which is a little bit weaker.  That was on the first draft; most people either saw the near term as being a bit weaker or about the same. But are similar obviously, particularly forecast under alternative policy a mechanical moving out of the interest rate path to mid-2015, and then additions of a $750 billion or $1 trillion LSAP program.  So that gives the FRB/US analysis; I'll come back to that unemployment rate, consensus forecast in red, and Like last time, we also looked at the consensus assumptions, and that's given in table 3 on page 3.  Under each variable, the first line, the status quo is, again, the same as the consensus forecast in table 1.  That's the forecast assuming the August policies continue.  The subsequent lines include, first, a change in the guidance to mid-2015, so simply subsequent alternatives.  The differences are consistent with the point as well.  And exhibit 2 shows the paths for the federal funds rate, the and inflation under optimal control, under the no-policy-change then the alternative policies provided in table 3.

it raises an I think the subcommittee is going to have to look at, which is that, of policy.  And in this you turn to table 2, which shows median forecasts in the September SEP, you'll see the Now, this time an issue came up, which was less of a concern last time, but important question that course, the SEP is conditional on each person's view of optimal monetary case, if

September 12-13, 2012

all participants and participants who assume further easing. assumed that the guidance would be SEP is broken into two categories: A majority of people submitted a forecast in which they advanced to 2015 and that we would undertake additional asset purchases.

actually assume that change in policy.  So then the question is, they took these policy differentials that are are different from what people expect, then that will, of So the SEP submissions how do you get from those SEP projections back to the no-policy-change baseline?  And what the staff proposed, and what they did, was basically in table 3, and they subtracted from the SEP results to get the baseline.  And to the extent that those differentials are not accurate or course, create some noise in the baseline forecast.

couple of reasons.  The first is that we need to think about-and we would be after, if you see what I'm saying. So I raise this for a talked about this last time-whether the consensus forecast we would want to release the pre-meeting status quo policy forecast-I think President Lockhart suggested that last timeor the postmeeting inclusive-of-the-action forecast, or both.  We could consider both; I think we need to discuss that.  If we do both, then we will have to figure out how to make sure people are comfortable with both the before and the

I think it will not be very much of a problem.  What I had proposed to given to you earlier on, in item 5 after the policy decision tomorrow, I will ask you you are comfortable with the consensus forecast inclusive of the policy action.  And if action, then this whole issue will be irrelevant because we'll be looking at the the further easing-at least for those participants who submitted that.  But I would best extract that information.  So, again, For this meeting, do is, as was whether we do take policy policies assuming just want to flag this point and note that we are planning a discussion in October of this whole project, and certainly one of the issues we'll want to discuss is whether or not we want to look at ex ante, ex post, or both forecasts, and how we

September 12-13, 2012

decision, I'll ask you if you are comfortable with the consensus make; are comfortable, with reservations; or you have a different view, to briefly state what Vice Chairman. tomorrow after the policy forecast, including whatever policy decisions we have a very different view.  And I'll ask you, if that difference is.  Any questions or comments?

You have this issue that the SEP has some people who VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. have no change in policy; others have changes in policy.  That's going to still be an outstanding issue going forward.  Do you have any thoughts on how we would-

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, that's what I'm raising-we have to figure out how to deal with that.  One possibility would be to specify-

B, and C? VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  A, yes-I suppose.  If we're going to do the ex ante, would be asked to make a projection conditional on actions.  But that's an issue that this particular clear, and I'm just flagging it for discussion by the subcommittee. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, before-meeting projection, then everybody the policy prior to the meeting, and the forecast could be used to say, 'We thought this was unsatisfactory.  That's why we took the action we did today.'  Alternatively, we could ask for a forecast conditional on one or more policy exercise has made

It's interesting to see the difference that people submit in you actually find out what people think about how efficacious the VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. terms of the policy, because policy is.

one of the considering here also has the cost of CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, of course.  That's right.  That's certainly benefits of doing that.  But everything that we are multiplying the number of projections and forecasts we're asking people to do, and that's something we need to take into account.  President Lacker.

September 12-13, 2012

I read the instructions, I thought of four different given that what we're trying to do in writing down a to write down the mean of a joint distribution of the economy and policy.  Well, if you you asking us to replace our What of the shocks have to be?  What's the most likely outcome that delivers that as the policy that policy?  That's a different question.  Or, as a mean? a bunch of different ways you can think of doing that, but we ought to be precise about MR. LACKER.  You mentioned parts of the consensus forecast process.  We're asked to provide a forecast conditional on a certain policy path, and I'd urge the staff and all of us to give some thought to what that ought to mean.  As interpretations of that.  You take as a forecast is ask us to submit a forecast conditional on a certain policy path, are reaction function with one that's fixed at that path unchangingly, and averaging over that? do all reaction-what economy is weak enough to justify do we take our reaction function and add-factor it so that it delivers that policy There's it.

One possibility would be to have everybody, again, assume appropriate monetary that you're describing; and then, try to see if there's a gravity of that, which looks like the consensus; describe that consensus; and then CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Of course-we'll have to be precise.  These are complexities. policy and deliver that joint distribution center of describe those who differ and qualitatively how they differ.  So that would be one approach. Another approach could be, for example, to ask people to use a specific reaction function or to specify their own reaction function.  President Kocherlakota.

Yes-thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I like the idea, in principle, action.  I think, though, that in practice, the latter is going to be very challenging, you could easily imagine that the Committee could come up with a choice of a policy MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. of having a consensus forecast based on status quo policy and then a consensus forecast based on the policy because

September 12-13, 2012

action that they had not considered ex ante.  And then it becomes very difficult to know how the timing would work and to get the logistics to work.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, absolutely.  And again, I think Governor Yellen's subcommittee will solve these problems for us [laughter] and bring that to us in October. President Bullard.

Let me just reiterate on this.  I do think that the market expectation of all aspects of monetary policy, is around.  Everyone can give their prognostication based on that. the market expectation is not a long way off. the exercise in my what we're doing. MR. BULLARD. the Committee's policy as of a certain date, which encompasses a fixed point that we could rally That would give us just one exercise to do.  Usually It might be somewhat off, but it's not a long way off, and it would simplify mind and would keep it clearer course, what the British and some others do.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That's, of MR. BULLARD.  Yes.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans.

MR. EVANS.  Does that so.

address President Lacker's concerns?  I wouldn't have thought right.

Yes-right. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Not exactly.  Only if it's approximately MR. EVANS.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Anybody else?  President Fisher.

I was going to make. MR. FISHER.  Narayana made the point questions?  Again, we will be CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other comments or discussing this at the next meeting.  President Evans.

September 12-13, 2012

It was triggered by in asking questions, where he alluded to the you put it, more accepting of a higher I personally don't see adopted in MR. EVANS.  Could I ask a question that's a little bit different? some comments that President Fisher made earlier fact that some people around the table would be, however inflation rate than others, or whatever.  And in exhibit 2 on page 5, this question comes to my mind, which is, there is an optimal control path that is shown that has inflation rising to-I think it's 2.3 percent, if it's consistent with previous Tealbook-style analyses. anything in this path that's inconsistent with our longer-run strategic approach that we January, and I just wonder if that's the sense of the Committee or if there's an important divergence of opinion there, which seems to be one of the points that President Fisher might have been raising.

that our objectives are-think of a increasing marginal cost of away from each objective.  We have a balanced approach, but people will have different is CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think we are clear quadratic objective function.  They're symmetrical.  There is an being models of the economy, and they'll have different weights in their objective functions.  So this obviously not a purely value-fee projection.  President Bullard.

Is exhibit 2 something that would be distributed as part of the forecast? MR. BULLARD. consensus been decided, but I wouldn't imagine of those things. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Again, nothing has we would want to do all

MR. BULLARD.  So this is just an internal document, like the ones we always use.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.

wasn't asking a question about communications.  I was asking more a MR. EVANS.  I question about how we interpret our longer-run strategic document, because at various times, we

September 12-13, 2012

make different comments about these types of outcomes, and it strikes me that there's less agreement on that particular observation than sometimes is given by the words that we use.

I've said in press conferences that it's a symmetric a balanced approach, and so on.  Anyone else?  [No response]  All right. Let's start our economic go-round with President Lacker. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. objective and we have Now we come to the main event.

have bounced back to neutral readings now, MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Intermeeting data, I think, have done little to alter the economic picture.  We're in a period of sluggish economic growth, clearly.  Our Fifth District survey measures, which fell sharply in July, and the tenor of our anecdotal reports has been middling of late, consistent with reports we've been hearing since the spring.  While activity is weak, we're not seeing any signs in our District of a dramatic slowdown around the corner-or a dramatic pickup, for that matter.

at our last meeting you took a longeryou noted, real the recovery began.  I think 2.2 percent is the growth Board economists Greg Howard, refer to them as butterfly charts, but I'm as rapidly from banking and financial crises as they do from other recessions, pretty convincing job of that.  Their charts also show that the current I thought it was appropriate, Mr. Chairman, that term perspective by focusing on economic growth over the entire recovery.  As GDP growth has averaged around 2 percent since precise number.  We keep seeing swings in growth every couple of quarters around that average. So it makes sense to focus on the longer-run path around which we're fluctuating, rather than just the last quarter or two.  At our last meeting, Mr. Chairman, you talked about why was so low, and you discussed the spider charts put together by Robert Martin, and Beth Anne Wilson.  I believe they not taking a stand on insects here.  The main purpose of their paper was to show that advanced economies recover and I thought they did a recovery in U.S. GDP tracks quite closely the typical advanced economy recovery from banking

September 12-13, 2012

crises, as well as the typical advanced economy recovery from housing slumps. I take away from their work is that we shouldn't have expected to do much better consistent with the message from some other gap, however. and financial The message than what we've experienced, and I think that's research along the same lines.  Now, the authors don't focus on the notion of a And for many people right now, the motivation for further stimulus is that the relevant gap is quite large.

was quite pleased to see the memo from Bruce Fallick and Jeremy Rudd on this subject. a helpful, well-organized description of how the staff thinks about and estimates economic But I'd like to make a suggestion or two for further clarifying our future in the absence of unanticipated shocks and under appropriate monetary what we've referred to as the 'longer-run normal rate of I think that's what we called it in our consensus statement in January.  That's a employment, this is the concept I think of: going to converge to several years from now, after the current shocks we've appropriate policy, we get back to some trend with no current shocks has faded out by the time the economy close to constant over time, or it may with some slow-moving and predictable things, such as the demographic composition and the like.  So I think when you look at a construct like the NAIRU, the nonI It's slack-lays it out quite clearly.  And I think this memo should help clarify our mutual understanding going forward. discussions.  My suggestion is that we distinguish carefully between two distinct conceptual notions of slack.  One concept is defined by the number to which the unemployment rate would converge in the policy.  This is essentially unemployment.' fine term for it.  When people refer to sustainable what the economy is experienced have dissipated and, under shocks-the mean forecast out there.  Now, this number probably doesn't vary much over time because, by definition, the effect of converges to this number.  In fact, this number might be vary only of the labor force

September 12-13, 2012

in a minute. accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, it's constructed with this notion in mind.  I'll come back to the NAIRU

economic slack, which I think we should distinguish from this based on the reference level of the unemployment rate with which it is most assessing current can think of this just as well in terms of the reference level with which it's most appropriate to compare current output for monetary policy as the 'natural rate,' although some writers refer to this and reserve 'natural rate' for something distinct.  But 'natural rate' tends used around the table here and that others have used, and it's what the I'm going to stick with that term for this reference rate. The second concept of first one, is appropriate to compare the current unemployment rate for the purposes of monetary policy.  Equivalently, one for output purposes.  This is sometimes referred to as the 'efficient rate' to be the term that we've staff memo uses.  So standard, modern, mainstream models, almost all of the shocks hitting doesn't vary much. rate.  That's very clear and what kinds of growth model that the Chairman referred to at our last meeting.  That model is the estimates they present in this memo-some are aimed at this longer-run notion, and clearly are aimed at this short-run reference notion.  For example, the NAIRU In some very simple models, these two concepts are identical.  But in general, they're not the same.  Indeed, in our the model should affect the natural rate, even if the longer-run normal rate Now, not all of the shocks that hit the economy should affect the natural in these models as well, and I'll talk more a little bit later about the difference shocks fall in that category.  By the way, I'd mention that modern models are all extensions of the Solow deterministic, nonmonetary.  These models are extended to include a role for monetary factors and to include the role of uncertainty and unpredictable shocks to the economy.  I think the staff memo would have been clearer if it had distinguished between these two notions of slack, because some pretty

September 12-13, 2012

are designed to estimate the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, deliberately exclude high-frequency factors, but our models tell us that's clearly the world in which the economy is hit by a range of shocks.  So my staff members, when they present to us a gap or a natural rate concept, adjusting the natural rate for the drought; that's a highadjustment.  But the logic for making that adjustment is really identical to the logic for rate that responds to current shocks.  I think it would also aid clarity if we, in our gap between the current human suffering. about the gap that's relevant where we're going to be several years from now. estimates they present because they wrong benchmark for policy in a suggestion would be that be clear about what they're trying to present.  I'll note here-and I'll come back to this in a second-the discussion we had about frequency this reference discussions, were mindful of this distinction between these two.  The unemployment rate and the long-run normal unemployment rate is exceptionally high by historical standards, and that gap clearly represents a tremendous amount of And I can understand-everyone should understand-why that would add urgency to the search for remedies to that.  But modern macroeconomics is pretty clear for the conduct of monetary policy, and it's conceptually different from the gap defined by the distance between where we are today and policy-relevant gaps?  Well, you need a model because you're counterfactual; you're talking about something that doesn't happen-it's a latent, able to extract something like that from the data, you different estimates.  The staff memo presents estimates an estimate of the current gap of a little under 3 percent, defined this second way, That compares with the NAIRU-based estimate that the Tealbook provides So how do you estimate talking about a unobserved variable.  You need a model to be and different models, obviously, give derived from EDO, the Board's New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. And it delivers the natural rate way.

September 12-13, 2012

you can see that you can get a significant difference there.  This you bring to bear makes a difference. of about 4½ percent, so illustrates the extent to which the model around the and we've tried to describe economic your estimate of the gap.  Now, rather than repeat myself-I know that hasn't I'd take the opposite tack and talk about what's in the gap. that's taken to the data is envisioned as driven by shocks and other all affect the data you see, but not all of them affect the natural affect the economy, but don't figure into this natural rate, are the things What could those things be?  Well, this depends, obviously, on the model you use to extract an estimate of the natural rate, and so Let's take a look at EDO, the Board's DSGE model.  Its estimate of the gap rate, as I said, and it's near 3 percent.  What would it take for the gap to going to say is based on my what's going on in that model-this is true for well-you'd have to believe that one of two sorts of things is going on First, you could believe that firms have not fully adjusted their prices in years ago.  These models are based for a time, they're or they're prevented from, adjusting their prices to reflect developments stickiness keeps prices from adjusting.  A fall So how big is the relevant gap?  Well, I've said before-and I think others table have said before-that we don't think it's large, factors that, in theoretical models, would affect the natural rate and so wouldn't add to the gap. So they'd reduce stopped me in the past-I thought The economy in a model developments.  Those shocks rate.  So the things that that affect the gap. you use to interpret the data, the model determine the gap. is based on the natural be that large in that model?  Now, I should caution here:  What I'm understanding of the model conceptually, theoretically.  I haven't looked at the empirical decomposition, but based on my understanding of a lot of other models as for the gap to be large. response to the downward shift in demand that occurred four on the notion of prices being sticky temporarily-that people set prices and, not incented toward, that they're seeing at their doorstep.  So this price

September 12-13, 2012

mechanism.  To you'd have to believe that there's an incredible amount of price stickiness find that plausible, and I don't think it lines up with other evidence we in demand shows up in quantities rather than prices at first, and then later, as prices adjust, the adjustment shows up in prices rather than quantities.  So that's the general attribute it all to that, in this economy.  I don't have on the degree of price stickiness in the economy.

you could believe, in order to believe that the gap is large, is shocks that have not affected the model's gap Well, in EDO, there are only two kinds of shocks that would gap.  One is a string of upward shocks to the degree of monopolistic power that firms Firms are monopolistic competitors.  They have a little bit of pricing amount of pricing power they have is determined by the degree of a substitute for each other pricing power, and that's why prices haven't adjusted, quantities have, gap is high.  Alternatively, you could believe that a string of analogous shocks in the more bargaining power in setting wages and are monopoly power from the firms they work for.  Now, I don't have direct from the model and the data.  You take the model kinds of things.  But those don't really match up, in my mind, to the you hear from people.  You just don't hear about firms having a lot years ago, and it certainly doesn't seem consistent to think I said, this is based on my understanding of EDO; my understanding of how the theoretical The second class of things that the economy has been hit by a string of large natural rate but have affected the economy.  And this is what the model attributes the large to.  What would those shocks be? affect the have in setting prices. power, not total, and the substitutability between goods.  For some reason, goods are less of now, so firms have more and the labor market has occurred, so that workers have able to extract a kind of observations on any of these.  You infer these as given, you infer these kinds of anecdotal stories more pricing power than they did four of workers as having a lot more leverage now, either.  So I find both of these implausible.  Now, as

September 12-13, 2012

EDO model, in the memo results, they didn't do 2008 shocks, how much is due to monopoly power shocks, how much is due to wage don't seem plausible, but the right way forward for us, in talking group under way that works with a set of these models.  There are other DSGE model is built-that is well documented.  In that the decomposition.  They didn't show us how much of the gap is due to sticky prices left over from pricing shocks.  I said they about these things, is to put some estimates on the table and do the decomposition.  We have a working models-Philadelphia, Chicago.  What's the other one?

I don't really understand why the DSGE be particularly huge have determining the natural rate versus the NAIRU reservation' relative to the source of the shock.  So I'm just curious what

MR. LACKER.  Sure.  Let me say two things to that.  The first is that progress has been made in putting the rudiments of a financial sector in these models.  The New York model is a leader on that.

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  But we're still in elementary school.

I'd point out, though, is that if we're going to either an explicit model gibberish.

The second thing think about the data we see, draw conclusions, and act on it, we're using or an implicit model.  There's no avoiding that.  Otherwise, what we're doing is explicit model has the advantage of others.  You can say, and it's perfectly legitimate to think, is important is not in this have a very articulate labor sector'-but we can debate that, and we can look at the magnitudes and talk about that.  So I think it's a vehicle for thinking, that pins things

LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you, President perfect straight man for the main event. Economic expansion remains positive but very modest.  Just a couple of comments from contacts.  First, housing-sector contacts and several of my banking directors reported that residential real estate activity in general is clearly improving.  Prices have firmed in many sales volume has increased, and permitting is rising.  Purchase mortgage applications have increased recently, and refinance activity remains the recent increase in purchases is being driven primarily by mortgage-financed homebuyers rather than cash investors.  Second, a director from a large management the view that a number of his firms, very large corporate clients, have resigned themselves to a 2 percent growth are largely on hold.  We heard a similar theme from several inflation and rising business costs are not much of a concern among our from the country's largest home-improvement retailer reported that suppliers are not asking for price increases in this environment.

In year and next, I remain less optimistic about the pace of GDP growth than current participation rates to make continuing but modest progress on the However, last week's job report makes it pretty clear that employment am concerned about the lack of any sustained progress on the year.  It is getting harder to rule out the possibility scenario of 150,000 jobs a month is at risk.  My perception is that the welldata.  I have no argument with the SEP bias that growth risks are weighted to the downside, but I don't rule out that these uncertainty drags Europe has been mildly encouraging, and it's plausible that if and European situation-are resolved few months, the outlook actually could be brighter.

With respect to employment, my baseline outlook has been a continuation of the trend of roughly 150,000 per month that has prevailed over the past two years.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Mr. Wilcox, did you want to add to the conversation?

September 12-13, 2012

I don't have a detailed response to President Lacker's comments, I thought I might just offer a few observations.  Sometimes I'm in sympathy with many of our ability to measure the economy, to estimate economy, to observe economic processes.  We think it's critically important aware of the extent of our ignorance and the I'm reminded of a comment that Larry Summers once made in quite a astrophysicists get together, they debate the fundamental validity of the laws of gravity. what we as economists do is, we have profound uncertainty about questions that are as of gravity.'  We on the staff do make every effort to distinguish shortadjusted our reference level of the and estimate, stemming from quality of functioning of the labor market.  We resolved. MR. WILCOX.  Yes. but the points that President Lacker makes.  I think it's important, though, to state that we take it as our remit to advise the Committee to the limit of and understand the not to do more than that, and we're profoundly ignorance of the macroeconomic profession at large, regarding key questions about how the macroeconomy works. different situation, in which he said, 'You know, economics is an interesting field.  I doubt that when And yet fundamental as the laws run influences that we can identify.  For example, we have unemployment rate in light of influences that we can identify emergency unemployment benefits and from the have adjusted our measure of the gap between the actual unemployment rate and the reference, or natural, rate of unemployment for those kinds of things.  But beyond that, we confront the real world in which data are imperfect, theory is deficient, policymaker and staff bandwidth is limited, and there are a lot of profound and fundamental debates to be regard to EDO, it is a state-of-the-art DSGE model coming directly out of the It's part, but only part, of the intellectual consult in the course of putting together our analysis that we provide to the With intellectual tradition that President Lacker refers to. base that we Committee.  Now, whether the empirical properties of that model are plausible or implausible is

September 12-13, 2012

are, and they're derived by an effort to work greater robustness than would be the case if we had a model or a single-intellectual-tradition strategy.  So I'm in sympathy with many of the Lacker raises, but I think we need to recognize that the macroeconomic to go before we can deliver the kind of clarity and certainty that it your remarks. a little difficult for me to say.  They are what they directly in that intellectual tradition.  We have pursued a diversified, multimodel strategy, which we think provides our analysis with a single points that President profession has a long way seems to me is implicit in much of

Bullard. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President you, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate Dave Wilcox's comments memo at the end here.  Let me talk for a minute economy, which continues to expand at a modest pace.  The drought in especially severe and is having an important effect on agriculturally based generally agree with the Tealbook analysis of the effect of the drought on the next couple of quarters.

Similarly, building permits for single-family homes 42 percent in Louisville, 14 percent in Little Rock, 46 percent in Memphis, and 23 percent in

I view the U.S. economy as being on a path not too from the one suggested in the work of Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff as cited by They noted that post-financial-crisis or post-bubble economies tend to grow for a long time.  Our economy clearly suffered through a collapse of a housing with an associated financial crisis, so it is not really that surprising that the a path similar to the one experienced by other countries that have been in a rapid return to the pre-crisis, bubble-influenced growth trend seems quite unrealistic according to the international cross-country am concerned about ongoing recession in Europe, this is affecting firms in the District and across the are reporting troubling or worrisome movements in revenue and volume data yet at the point where I Nationally, I view the macroeconomy for a variety of reasons, I do not think the current trigger outsized monetary different President Lacker. relatively slowly bubble, along economy is following similar situation.

In addition, I do not see financial stress as being particularly high at the current moment.

what Europe can deliver during the fall.  As I've you before, I've become more pessimistic on the medium-term European prospects I have come to doubt that Europe has the type of either informal or formal I think the jury remains what the Europeans do, and see Italian yields across the yield curve for and substantial, even if the mediumaggressively in order to mitigate the euro-area recession.  Indeed, the ECB is preoccupied relationship and monetary policy.  So that's keeping the ECB from acting, makes me worried that the U.S. action could exacerbate the recession there by euro.  And indeed, the euro has been stronger in recent weeks.  You might say I think it makes sense to wait and see told all of during the summer, as institutional arrangements to deal with a crisis of this magnitude.  Still, out on that issue, so it would make sense for us to wait and see what happens.  Certainly, recent declines in Spanish and government debt in both countries have been impressive and longer-term outlook for Europe is questionable.  I am concerned that the ECB is not really easing with selective debt purchases on a basis that requires some conditionality, which means that they have to wait for the country to react to their offer.  This throws off the timing of the between the normal business cycle which strengthening the

August 2011, we were also at 9.1 percent.  However, today's year after that is 8.1 percent, 1 full percentage point lower.  That's about as we can do in this game, about as good as we can do in one year's time.  The U.S. Labor markets in the U.S. are improving, although in a halting and uneven way.  It is sometimes noted that the national unemployment rate has not improved during 2012.  I might remind the Committee that this was also true in 2011.  We had 9.1 percent unemployment in January of 2011.  As of unemployment one good as

comments on the slack memo.  I do appreciate the memo, and I think it did a great years at the Fed.  I thought it was accurate and outlined the issues very well.  The memo, you're trying to fix something, it's you're trying to fix.  And the great thing about the New Keynesian model is, you're trying to fix.  You're trying to fix the fact that there are sticky prices out in a certain way by certain types of monetary you might make inside the model are quite subtle, we need to do?' and 'What is it that we want to fix?'  The problem is, inside these models, what we learned from the models is that you can A few job of outlining the approach to the slack issue that has been taken by the staff for, I believe, many to me, suggests that the 'get-serious DSGE approach' shows exactly how complicated this concept really is when you try to get down to it.  Whenever good to know what you know what there, and you can improve welfare in that model policy actions.  But different assumptions that and they can imply different welfare outcomes-that is, different amounts of utility that actually get delivered to households.  I think that there's no substitute going forward, that the Committee just has to take a stand on these complicated issues and we have to roll up our sleeves and say, 'What is it that we think because of the subtleties

But in any event, that volatile flexible price level of output is we traditionally have thought about it in macroeconomic inadvertently be doing more harm than good, depending on what's actually world and depending on which assumptions are really the ones that make the most sense. there's a very idea.  The core idea is that the flexible price level of output is a volatile object. economy that had no frictions whatsoever, there would be all kinds of shocks, and that level of output, which would be a Pareto-optimal thing, would be moving around all of the time.  The actual level of output that we observe is probably may be scope not going to be a smooth trend the way circles since the 1950s and 1960s.  Most of what we try to do when we think about potential output and measures of slack is to get a smooth trend.  I don't think that that's supported by the modern macroeconomic literature.

uncertainty about estimates of you're willing to swallow other assumptions about the statistical models or the you want to do is forecast, and you I've talked about slack many times here, but I do think that, going forward, it argue about whether are the right ones, whether we like them, and whether we think we can bring assumptions.  And we can get it clearer in our own heads with our policy. The memo also makes it clear that there's tremendous slack, even if economic models.  As I've emphasized in the past, even if all don't care about all of the theoretical issues, the relationships between the slack measures and the actual inflation outcomes are questionable themselves and are weak and, I think, have gotten weaker over time. would behoove the Committee to put a clear model on the table.  We can those assumptions other evidence to bear on the particular how we think we're helping matters

also thought it was very interesting in the memo-I've often wondered about the term 'NAIRU,' and in fact, either-so just 'IRU.'  It's just 'IRU' at the end.  The 'A' and staff members make it clear that they've had to take that part out we should quit using the term, since the acceleration part isn't in there a lot. I 'NAIRU.'  The memo makes it clear that the 'A' no longer belongs in the 'N' doesn't belong in 'NAIRU' stands for 'accelerating' because it wasn't working very well over maybe quite a long time period.  So I thought that that was interesting.  Maybe anymore.  Thanks

Rather than waiting for Godot, we are waiting for recovery in the labor market continues to elude that tomorrow we arrive at a better solution.  [Laughter] MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

In the Beckett play, the characters seriously consider suicide as their best solution to the seemingly endless wait.  I do hope employment growth or year-or, for that matter, the end year-without further accommodation.  The modest employment growth did not surprise considered the possibility of the further declines in the a striking feature of last Friday's employment report, Unfortunately, last month's labor market report was quite consistent with my submission for the experimental consensus forecast.

After Kalman filter, but I'm assured and highly persistent supply and demand earlier comments, I would rate of interest.  In the model, a highly persistent reduction in demand all else being equal, in this empirical model.  So, influenced by Board with gross Laubach-Williams model using both about 1 percentage point facing in our economy. In gauging the medium-term outlook for the economy and the stance of monetary policy, I this morning's discussion, I'm a little nervous about going into the that Thomas is ready with a white board to answer any technical questions regarding our model. But this model seeks to distinguish between transitory influences on economic activity.  In response to President Bullard's stress that in our model, we do not impose any restriction that potential output growth is smooth. We let the data speak to that.  The highly persistent influences on demand can be summarized by what we call the natural lowers the natural rate of interest.  And I think importantly for thinking about the stance of monetary policy and a number of issues around that, our balance sheet policies should boost the natural rate of interest, staff research that highlights the information content of gross domestic income along domestic product, I've estimated a modified version of the GDI and GDP.  The current estimate of the natural rate of interest from this model is about minus 75 basis points.  The current real funds rate, therefore, is only below this estimate of the natural rate.  This implies that the current extent of monetary accommodation, including our balance sheet policies, has only modestly exceeded the severe headwinds that we're

forecasts for subdued economic growth and very little progress on the years, my SEP projection assumes considerable Treasuries and MBS.  They expand the Fed's balance sheet by about $1 trillion over year or so.  And with this stimulus, I expect a faster recovery, with real GDP growth of year and 3¼ percent in 2014, with the unemployment rate edging down to at the end of next year and 7.3 percent at the end of 2014.  I see the risks to this downside.  Another bout of brinkmanship around the fiscal cliff seems Here I would just echo the comments made Vice Chairman Dudley.  I share those views and was somewhat more pessimistic than problems remain:  a actions may serve as a useful bridge Given my employment mandate over the next few additional monetary policy stimulus.

The problems plaguing Europe also remain daunting, with considerable risk to our economy if the financial crisis intensifies. earlier by perhaps the Tealbook's description of recent events in Europe.  The bold program that the ECB has announced will certainly buy some short-run relief, but the underlying lack of political federalism, an unsustainable fiscal outlook, and disparities in economic competitiveness across Europe.  So, in summary, the ECB's loan.  I hope it is not a bridge loan to nowhere.

It seems I talk to stresses that uncertainty is holding back hiring and investment.  Indeed, payroll expansions.  So a key question for monetary policy is whether The fiscal cliff and the uncertainty, they also everyone uncertainty appears to have virtually paralyzed some businesses, prompting them to postpone capital spending and delay this rise in uncertainty should be viewed primarily as a shock to demand, which lowers both output and inflation if not counteracted by additional monetary policy stimulus, or as a shock to

As I described back in December, empirical Fed finds that over the past 30 years, higher uncertainty a negative aggregate demand shock that reduces both economic activity and Lacker will be very happy to hear micro-founded as a demand shock is confirmed by DSGE models, both by my staff and by academic researchers.

This affects effects of an uncertainty shock on consumption when prices are slow to adjust, causing businesses to cut production further.  This output gap, a fall in inflation, and this is I mentioned a moment ago.  All told, both theory and data I believe are holding back our economy today really as adverse shocks to demand, which monetary policy should aim to offset. supply, such as the drought, which lowers output but boosts inflation.  Recent theoretical and empirical research has research by my staff at the San Francisco operates like inflation.  Following uncertainty shocks of the types that we currently face, expenditures on consumer durables, investment, short-term interest rates, and inflation all fall, while unemployment rises, in this analysis.  Now, I'm sure President what I'm about to say, and that is that we also looked at this issue in a fully DSGE model.  This finding that uncertainty acts primarily the research using such increase in uncertainty both supply and demand in the models.  However, in these models, the demand effects are by far the dominant ones.

In order to achieve these projected growth rates, I assume that we provide further policy accommodation by extending the period of very low rates into 2015.

It was particularly disappointing in that the BLS confirmed that the economy had made very little progress in labor markets over household survey make the progress on the unemployment rate difficult to interpret, the decline in the employment-to-population ratio to essentially its post-recession trough makes it clear that there has been little sustained progress in labor markets.  Nonetheless, as GDP growth picks up over the next two years, I am expecting that we will make gradual progress As mentioned in the memo on economic slack, the Cleveland staff has taken a close look at the flows into and out of unemployment to examine the natural rate of unemployment.

year of unsatisfactory economic performance.  This MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Following our July meeting, the key question was whether the incoming data would finally begin to show substantial and sustainable improvement in labor markets.  It's pretty clear that the answer to that question is no.  Without a doubt, 2012 will go into the books as another

September 12-13, 2012

year in a row of growth around 2 percent.  This pace of growth leaves resource slack At the same time, the inflation outlook is not threatening, and numerous theoretical is the third quite large. and empirical analyses show that there are ways to provide additional accommodation that will improve this economic situation.

downside risks My their current operations are being adversely affected by increasingly my regular contacts repeated comments he had major U.S. conglomerate, who was a former Fed Bank chair contacts thought the odds of truly awful outcomes had a positive comment.  The recent ECB announcements regarding outright will be conditioned on fiscal consolidation that likely will be difficult to and bad for growth in those countries.  And without stronger growth, the periphery face repeated crisis events over the next several years.  As one financial elephant in the room is the U.S. fiscal cliff.  On the upside, my contacts that surely the parties in Washington will find a way to limit the damage after the election. In terms of recent developments, the problems that we've characterized as earlier in the year have materialized into actual headwinds.  They are gathering in strength. business contacts noted that negative forces in the U.S. and around the world.  Similar to some comments that President Lockhart made, apparently CEOs are sharing their gloomy outlooks with their fellow CEO interlocutors, and this has the potential to reinforce downward expectations and spiral into even softer spending and hiring.  For example, one of heard from the CEO of a somewhere.  According to my contact, this CEO instructed all of his business units to plan for the possibility that the U.S. will experience a lost decade, like Japan.  I think that's disturbing. With regard to Europe, many of my declined, and that's monetary transactions give the fiscal authorities somewhat more time to maneuver, but the additional bond buying achieve countries are going to contact we spoke to put it, 'All the Europeans have done is transform an acute problem into a chronic one.'  The other say

a messy outcome that would result in very significant fiscal year. But on the downside, many currently see uncertainty over the cliff weighing on activity, and no one can rule out the possibility of drag hitting us around the turn of the is that I'm hearing commentary that indicates monetary rates are leading them For instance, we heard Indeed, there's been a lot of talk about residential construction you pointed out at our last meeting, Mr. Chairman.  I they are seeing excessive risk-taking or anything approximating financial One bit of positive news accommodation is helping.  Several financial contacts say that today's low to increase investment, and that should facilitate future activity. comments on how funding for distressed properties has increased and capital is being redeployed to the residential sector. improving, as several have noted.  Furthermore, refinancing continues to help firms strengthen their balance sheets, putting them in a position to increase investment or pass on funds to someone else more likely to spend them, as should note that while low rates are pushing some to undertake more investment, our financial contacts do not say that froth.  And in the past, they've not been shy about pointing that out when they have seen that.

I said earlier, conditioned on our current policies, the outlook for economic growth is and certainly not within analysis more accommodation that can improve these clearly demonstrate this.  The LSAP memos had simulations optimal control simulations and the nominal-income-levelAs unacceptable.  It's unacceptable in part because recent data reinforce the obvious point that high inflation is not a concern, certainly not relative to our long-run objective our balanced approach strategy.  And it's unacceptable because mainstream monetary clearly indicates that there are means of providing outcomes.  The Board staff analyses that pointed that out, FRB/US's targeting simulations point that out, too.  Mike Woodford's careful analysis in his Jackson Hole paper showed the same.

September 12-13, 2012

I'm at this point, let me make a couple of comments about DSGE models, which discussed earlier today.  It is certainly the case that we are presented with results from four being looked at:  the EDO model out of the Board, our Chicago model, question that President Lacker was asking was, is slack, and how is it measured?  At some level within you look at the with When I get to change my price and I've seen things change, what's my I won't be What have I faced, what am I expecting others to face, and Slack is often viewed in these models as a useful proxy at best.  If there's a lot about marginal costs.  And so, when you think about that, these models are at the inflation data and everything around those data and saying, 'We just don't pressures.'  I can't tell you exactly what the resource slack is that is embodied in all four of the models that While were models that are currently Philadelphia's model, and New York's model.  A in the context of these models, how big the context of these models, this is a bit of a red herring.  For instance, if projections, all of the inflation forecasts coming out of these models are under our 2 percent goal, and that's true through 2015.  So, even in a model that's looking at whatever measure it is that's holding back inflation, there is no inflationary pressure-and some of the models have much less inflationary pressure than others.  The second point is that the theory in these models is really about marginal costs.  That's the fundamental variable.  The firms in these models are faced the following question: marginal cost structure that tells me how much I should increase my price, given that able to do it next time for sure? things like that? of slack, then your marginal costs won't be rising; they'll be low, and things like that.  But the fundamental is really really looking see inflationary that, but we don't see inflationary pressures, and that's coming out of we're presented with quarterly.

Lacker raised is, if sticky prices are really what's a lot.  In these models, Another point that President fundamental here, why haven't they adjusted already?  And you hear that

September 12-13, 2012

given, and John Taylor has years.  But aggregate demand shocks that I believe President Williams's comments were pointing at.  At least we've different is at work.  And then it's also the case that inflationary more delicate and are subtle about what the stochastic process is for marginal cost and how they're updated and what inflation expectations are.  This gets at a point of FRB/US projections because I see all of this monetary accommodation that?'  I talk to people, and they worry a lot because they all at some level, and so we just don't see things getting out of hand.  I want to that this is not a FRB/US question per se, but it's a statement about how much we know within the context of well-articulated macro models.  It's way beyond just FRB/US. a lot of asynchronous price adjustment for whatever reason is contributed importantly to exactly that point going way back over the last 20 or more even allowing for the fact that maybe there would have been adjustments already, I think it's reasonable to assume that we've been hit with a sequence of negative along the lines certainly been surprised the last three summers in a row that output has been lower than we were projecting, so something expectations matter in these pricing equations and models.  This is a little subtle.  Apparently inflation expectations are stable in all of these models, but there modeling choices at work in each of them pressures dissatisfaction-when I talk with various people in the Federal Reserve, they might say, 'I don't like looking at the coming, and I don't see inflation coming, and why is about inflation.  We aren't able to model that-apparently not satisfactorily, come back to the same place, which is, expectations are well anchored or the stochastic process is mean reverting point out really All of our DSGE models have that same feature.

So the bottom line, Mr. Chairman, is that this is the third summer in a row that economic growth has failed to achieve escape velocity, and the economy's liftoff has fizzled on the

September 12-13, 2012

launching pad.  It seems clear that the outlook crosses the threshold that justifies more action.

I get the same kinds would say-usually from different people, but they sometimes come from the considers its date to keep rates low through it that the Fed is committed to keeping rates low for two going to are expected to be low for that long, the Fed is signaling that conditions course, I say to them, further along than you might have thought.'  At this you guys just say that?'  At [laughter] because that that we need to communicate more clearly and transparency, and these are, I think, good motivations. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  When we were in Jackson Hole, we asset purchase tools and our communication tools, and so I'd like to give from the of questions, I same person.  The first comment is, as the FOMC late 2014, people are concerned, why is years?  How could the Fed commit like this without thinking about the fact that the world could change in some fashion?  And the second comment is, by saying that interest rates are be low for that long or will be weak, and that, in and of itself, is suppressing demand.  Now, of 'No, you misunderstood what the FOMC is intending to say to you.  It is meaning to communicate that the economic conditions threshold for raising rates is now higher than you might have thought.  The recovery has to be stage, my questioner says, 'Well, that makes sense, but why didn't that point, I usually turn the conversation to something about fracking seems to work.  To me, this kind of dialogue suggests about our reaction function.  And communication about our reaction function is sometimes motivated in terms of accountability

That's the main thing they're hearing. Now, the changes that have been made in B(5) relative to what was in the previous FOMC statement in July-B(5) conditioning clauses have been removed, although many readers were not to those conditional clauses anyway.  I think the lead-in sentence to B(5) is have to say, most people takeaway is the about how we I've mentioned before, I think that a good reaction function should have at some measure of inflationary pressures and some measure of labor market approach that President Plosser, President Williams, and I are following in those changes of the as leading to changes in measures of inflationary pressures and labor market translate those changes in inflationary pressures this to say that I think we've completed our cycle of going through the glad to hear that.  That said, just like the FOMC statement itself, the So before we communicate our reaction function, we have to start thinking formulate one, and as least two inputs: underutilization.  These inputs would capture how well we're doing in terms of our two mandates, and our policy stance, I would think, should evolve as these inputs change.  I see this as the basis for the our alternative policy statements.  The KPW statements emphasize only data that are viewed underutilization.  And then the KPW statements and labor market underutilization into the rationale for the Committee's policy decisions.  At point, I'll digress briefly parallel FOMC statements, and President Plosser, I believe, will bring forward the KPW approach to the subcommittee on communications for further consideration.  So I'm sure the subcommittee members are

September 12-13, 2012

relate KPW memos are very oriented around changes in monetary accommodation and how they to changes in conditions.

key challenge we've struggled with is that it's much easier for us accord about the changes in these variables than it is for us to reach accord, at least as precluding the possibility of developing a I think this is where the consensus forecast process is a very Committee view about you accommodation.  'The unemployment rate is too high over the mandate-consistent levels':  Then the Committee should contemplate Ultimately, though, a Committee reaction function has to translate the level of inflationary pressures and the level of resource utilization into a decision about the level of monetary accommodation.  A to reach qualitatively, about the levels of inflationary pressures and the levels of resource utilization.  As we saw from submissions of the consensus forecast, there are very different views around the table on that.  Some might see this heterogeneity Committee reaction function, but useful way forward.  It provides a way for us to come together behind a the medium-term inflation outlook and about the economy's performance relative to the employment mandate, conditional on our current policy stance now and as anticipated.  Then we can usefully formulate the Committee's reaction function as a mapping from that consensus view into policy choices.  'Medium-term inflation is too high relative to target':  That would say should contemplate reducing medium run relative to adding accommodation.

about the economy seems clear, and it's FOMC statements.  The Committee expects inflation to be at or running too low; Mr. Chairman, the Committee's consensus view been described in many recent below target over the medium run and unemployment to continue to be elevated for some time relative to mandate-consistent levels.  That consensus view-inflation

And I'll return to the question being posed to me District interlocutors:  Under what conditions will the FOMC begin to I will argue that our communications often suggest the FOMC is unemployment, even if that low unemployment rate is not translating of alternative B offers us an not against low if it doesn't lead to medium-term inflationary pressures.  Maybe that clarification I opened by discussing a about our reaction function.  In the next go-round, can also provide implicitly by my Ninth raise the fed funds rate? unwilling to tolerate low into medium-term inflationary pressures.  And I think paragraph 5 ′ opportunity to clarify our attitude toward low unemployment-that we're unemployment could provide stimulus that's appropriate in light of the Committee's consensus outlook.

I'm not alone in having wished for a stronger employment report last Friday.  The remains above This has generated a discussion about whether the continuing high levels of I actually don't find this conversation very for policy.  Rather, I believe it's better to think about whether the high level unemployment can be addressed by further easing of financial conditions, which is what we conclude that unemployment calls accommodation, we must understand more about the nature of the Lacker's observations.  It's not about whether unemployment is cyclical, structural, we observe. I know payroll increase in August and the downward revisions to June and July were disappointing. Despite the strong actions that the Fed has taken, the unemployment rate 8 percent. unemployment are structural or cyclical in nature. useful, particularly of monetary policy would entail.

It's about understanding the nature of the shock that's causing the problem that and public debate expresses a wide range of views, and we should be humble about example, the difficulty of transferring skills from hard time going to source of mismatch.

Those who lost their jobs in construction will have a other industries.  But this type of unemployment cannot be solved by monetary policy. However, it's not the only across sectors. middle-skill occupations, which tend to be focused on routine tasks, are disappearing because of

want to make a comment on President Fisher's really driven by demand and capacity utilization, things of that nature.  So I channel by which monetary policy stimulates the VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  First, I last remark.  My understanding is that capital spending has never been particularly interest rate sensitive.  It's wouldn't expect that to be a really strong economy.

MR. FISHER.  Can I just make a point to that?

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sure.

of our statement, we were saying that business fixed fixed investment?  And, more My point is that in the responses I'm getting inquiry-not systematically organized, although the systematic surveys that we see, NFIB and others, show that it is questionable whether or not we are actually employment.  The question is, are we affecting employment over the short term or the a very strong argument, at the last meeting.  If you're advising a corporation about what to do with the savings can achieve through cheaper capital, they can invest it in greater plant or equipment back their stock, or they can increase their dividends.

The question is, are we affecting business important than that, are we affecting employment? to anecdotal through the affecting long term?  We have a wealth effect.  The Chairman has made that including that they expansion, they can buy argue that the latter.

My point was that I don't think very many people in the VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. room would debate the point that capital spending is not going to be very influenced by small changes in interest rates.  So I don't think that's something that we have a big disagreement about around the table.

September 12-13, 2012

as the outlook is concerned, since the last meeting, I think there's been very little a bit better-the retail sales data, the motor worse-like the ISM, which fell below 50, and the components of weak.  Inventory strength actually held up the ISM, which is a little been weak.  I've noticed that, if you look at goods orders ex air, the rate of orders now has fallen below the rate of going to happen to capital going forward.  In terms of payrolls, I was prepared to come into the meeting, if we had are and how we can't take any But the reality is, if you really look at the trend-and understand that there's a series-the last two months, 118,000 per month; so far this year, 139,000 per you look at the you see is basically either a flat trend or maybe a gradually slowing I would take away from the payroll data.

Now, there's noise month to month, but if longer-term trends, what trend.  So that's what also two other negative developments that I think are really worth highlighting. environment continues to worsen.  We've talked a lot about Europe, but you look at the official GDP growth the number for the last quarter.  But if you look trade, for example-it would not at all show.

And this goes back to President Williams's comments.  I'm convinced that monetary policy stimulus effects probably become attenuated over time, way that monetary policy works is by affecting the timing of spending years in a row.  And I expect what monetary policy impulse to the growth side is actually lessening over you say it's consistent disappointment because of headwinds or is not as stimulative, as we thought, I think foreshadowed with action at this Now, what's the lesson of the past few years is that we've been consistently disappointed on the There are two thought, but there's another explanation as well-that maybe monetary policy is not as accommodative as pretty because part of the decisions.  We don't really have an experience where we've had a period like this in which monetary policy has supposedly been very loose for many we're seeing is that the time.  Regardless of whether consistent disappointment because monetary policy either way, they both imply that we should do more.  We've essentially foreshadowed forceful action in the August FOMC statement, the minutes to that meeting, and the Chairman's Jackson Hole speech, so I think it's time to follow up on what we've meeting.

My own view is that policy uncertainty has been evidence of its policy uncertainty, and they've related this economic variables, such as payroll employment growth.  They show that years, such as uncertainty about broader decisions, then a lifting of that uncertainty might arguably provide a significant boost to spending.  Under a uncertainty in the months after the exerting some negative influence on aggregate demand.  Some systematic influence comes from empirical work by Nick Bloom at Stanford.  Bloom and his coauthors have developed a high-frequency measure of economic measure to key increases in economic policy uncertainty foreshadow declines in output, employment, and investment, and that high levels of policy uncertainty in recent future tax policies and the debt ceiling, have hampered the recovery.

Bloom's index of economic policy spiked up in the summer of 2011, but by March it pre-recession levels. economic recovery was sputtering.  On the premise that economic policy uncertainty affects economic activity through consumer and business indexes of consumer sentiment and business optimism peaked in April or May.  So an increase in economic policy uncertainty does not seem capable of explaining the spring slowdown.  This suggests to me that spending is unlikely to surge, even if policy uncertainty the months ahead.  Unfortunately, our than just uncertainty about the future direction of

Uncertainty provides a reason why we should act forcefully now to strengthen the recovery, rather than trying to keep our powder dry.  Given the downside risks to the current outlook, and the constraints on our ability to provide stimulus while the funds rate is at the lower bound, the best we can do at this point is to ensure that the economy is as resilient as possible in case we are faced with fiscal for hysteresis effects yet, but our current situation is unprecedented, at least in Another argument for strong action relates to hysteresis.  We face the worrisome risk that the longer the economy operates with such high levels of slack, the more likely it is that the downturn will have a lasting negative impact on employment and potential output.  I've seen no strong evidence recent U.S. history.  In the early 1980s, the unemployment rate fell almost 4 percentage points over the 2¾ years following its late 1982 peak, to 7 percent.  By contrast, since its most recent peak in October 2009, the unemployment rate has fallen less than 2 percentage points.

Taking this argument one step further, I gains in output and employment in a highby pulling population segments into the labor force that for a long time Moreover, hysteresis effects may become labor force participation.  As the Tealbook box shows, the participation rate remains far below the staff's estimate of its demographic trend rate, and persistently poor job-finding prospects may well leave would argue that just as there can be permanent costs of allowing unemployment to remain high for an extensive time, there can also be permanent pressure labor market.  We saw some evidence of this in the late 1990s, when hysteresis seemed to be working in reverse had been excluded.  Chronic labor shortages induced firms to invest more heavily in training,

In Tetlow's weight on unemployment undershoots below the NAIRU, Hysteresis provides a runs as follows.  Our usual loss function is symmetric around the NAIRU.  It thus assigns equal costs to given size deviations of unemployment above and below hysteresis, the penalty for a deviation of unemployment above that for an identical deviation of unemployment below asymmetric weighting of unemployment gaps circumstances are substantial.  Bob Tetlow, a staff member in the and Statistics, has been exploring optimal control simulations where the loss function depends on the squared deviations of a transformation of the unemployment rate from the NAIRU, rather than on the squared deviations of the unemployment rate itself from the tractable technique for, in effect, assuming simulations, the only policy tool available is the path of the federal funds rate.

I'll just say that I think it's not inconsistent, but there are four assumptions forecast than in the Tealbook and, maybe, in the forecasts of you.  The first one is that there is an underlying strength in the fundamentals of the credit supply-and that this confidence as well as concern Europe and the fiscal cliff, but that whenever loan demand picks up, the will be fully available to meet it.  The second one is that it'll be especially difficult second half of this year and the first half of next year, as investment and either paralyzed or distorted by uncertainty about policies, and that, on balance, the uncertainty itself will depress activity I do still see a potential for believe purchasing mortgages might be helpful here, but you might think.  And, finally, I have assumed that we choose B today.  Furthermore, in light of my assumptions about the fiscal cliff, we're more unsatisfactory progress as we approach the year; and that the deterioration will lead us to continue asset purchases well into 2013.

Third, the one place an upside surprise is in housing, and I not necessarily in the ways that alternative likely to face deteriorating conditions than simply end of the recent meetings, I've talked at length about my belief in the first assumption, and I'm I'd like to discuss assumptions 2 and 3 in this round and assumption 4 for the policy round.  Beginning with my pessimism about year and the first part of next, almost every conversation that I've had with a Things seem pretty much the tendency to put all expansion decisions off until after the election.  Oddly enough, these In not going to repeat that today.  But reserve comments about the rest of this business person or a banker recently has had the same theme: same-slow, steady improvement in business fundamentals, but with a new long-term investment or

They've strengthened their balance sheets and found ways to grow the bottom line even in the face of sluggish top-line growth. likely at least partly investments that do get the green light are mostly any plans for hiring.  I believe the marked slowdown in business spending seeing is get closer to the end of the year and the expiration of tax cuts, implementation of what could happen, whether who expect that they'll have to cut staffing if will surely adjust their spending accordingly, and this potential pall on retailers nervous about their inventories.  Those same inventory decisions in the face of a potential Coast ports by a longshoremen's strike.  So who could blame them if they a bit off their purchases just to be sure?

So I think we contingency plans for how we can shore up confidence in the face of a than thinking just about reasons, I've taken on board a bit of a lean toward the portion of my forecast.

year are now taking full hold in house price movements, and that pointing up.  This makes a difference.  The staff estimates that roughly year that's already pretty much baked in, followed by a models are predicting continued strong gains in house prices.  Staff and residential investment are on the conservative side, tempered by the housing recovery so far. In contrast, my continued optimism about housing and the underlying strength in the economy shows through in my medium-term forecast.  I think that the inventory factors that began to emerge early in the the momentum arrow is 3 million households, almost one-fourth of underwater households, moved from a negative to a positive equity position in the second quarter.  The Tealbook baseline forecast assumes a 5 percent increase in house prices this leveling-off.  But some forecasts of house prices concern about foreclosure pipelines, the elevated level of vacant houses, weak household formation, and the tepid pace of

September 12-13, 2012

I think there's reason for more optimism.  Foreclosure pipelines are full because the clogged by national moratoriums or retooling for new modification programs.

As for the vacant is outside of bank REO we don't know why they're held off the market, I'm not sure we can make even parents will not stay there until And when they do form households, they're going to require housing Here exits are still clogged, but the pace of new delinquencies has slowed markedly.  The exits are no longer current backlog is more closely tied to state-specific or operational issues that seem to me unlikely to suddenly clear and release inventory, a large portion of the vacant homes not listed for sale inventory.  Because assumptions about their sudden return to the market.  I view the potential for pent-up demand to show through in faster household formation and put upward pressure on house prices as more likely than the potential for a surge in foreclosures to hold prices down.

To be sure, mortgage lending conditions are still extremely tight, but some recent developments should help.  The specter of putback risk has reportedly been holding back loans to borrowers at the lower committed to reducing putback risk beginning in January 2013 through better front-end quality control and time limits on liability.  With house prices on the rise, fewer loans should fall through because of appraisal issues.  Regulatory uncertainty should clear, as new regulatory

I want to investigate actual I spoke with this time who were in the mortgage business were talking about the difference between a range of 0.5 to 0.6 ROA, for meat left on the house price and housing Probably the biggest drag on lending is the shrinkage of loan origination capacity.  The industry is showing signs of strain in what looks to be only compared the best fertilizer, we should see more banks data, but anecdotally, the bankers actually having record profits, while those who weren't in mortgage origination were wondering about their survival.  I'm those with no mortgage business, versus one of 1.30 to 1.50, for those with a mortgage business.

There's been evidence of declining dynamism in U.S. labor markets for a decade.  There certainly service-sector jobs-if they had better might then

September 12-13, 2012

again, a chronic issue rather than a cyclical one.  I actually think that attributable to structural factors.  There's been, you all know, substantial, good, and careful work from the Federal Reserve Banks of York, and San Francisco over the past several years that has supported that I think among academic researchers, the convergence is also manifesting itself, at Jackson Hole, following on, by about five much of the same material and came to many undoubtedly true, but unlike so many other questions, there's been a substantial convergence of views-not entirely, but a substantial convergence of views-around the proposition that a relatively small portion of the big jump in unemployment that we've seen is as Cleveland, New conclusion.  And as shown most recently in Ed Lazear's paper months, Jesse Rothstein's paper, which surveyed of the same conclusions.

Fed research staff was course, starts from a very different perspective on long-term unemployment among unemployed workers means that newly unemployed workers exit rates, and that over time, the composition of the pool of the looked at the paper spoke with others here at the Board about it, I actually don't think it establishes a case for structural unemployment.  There are a lot of and may well have I actually don't think it's making a structural argument, at least not if we as referring to nontransitory unemployment that can't be affected fairly fluctuations in aggregate demand.  It would be unsurprising to learn that firms are Jeff, at the last meeting, suggested that a paper done by Richmond a dissonant voice on this basic proposition that structural unemployment was not a big part of the story.  This paper, of than the literature I just referred to a moment ago.  The Richmond Fed paper argues that an unobserved heterogeneity have inherently different unemployed shifts toward workers who started with the lower exit rates.  I after Jeff talked about it at the last meeting, and I and empirical and technical questions about the paper-it's certainly interesting significant merit-but think of 'structural' directly by

September 12-13, 2012

firm that is hiring.  That phenomenon consistent with a demand-driven increase in unemployment.  More generally, the variation in the pool of the unemployed over for unemployment increases also explain the reversals that less valuable This seems, to me at least, more a cyclical than a structural explanation, and thus, don't think it really undercuts the consensus which I referred earlier. more likely to lay off relatively less-valued employees whose lesser perceived abilities may mean that they're less likely to be quickly plucked up by a is entirely Richmond Fed model attempts to decompose the time.  So it addresses the reasons for fluctuations in unemployment over history-in recessions, but also in recoveries.  The reasons take place during recoveries.  That is, as there are fewer unemployed, firms cannot afford to be as demanding and thus are more likely to turn to the pool of the supposedly workers. again, whatever the ultimate merits of the paper, I reached in the papers to ago.  The Richmond paper describes something as the 'true duration opposed to the 'unobserved heterogeneity' position that it takes.  The the overall will be macroeconomic effects.  As Janet said, would manifest themselves.  But I have to say, to date, there still isn't I think if one looks at what's been happening One final thought on structural unemployment, and this relates a bit to what Janet was saying a moment dependence' position, as true duration dependence position is that, quite apart from any inherent worker qualities, the bad luck of being unemployed for an extended period will itself begin to erode employability of enough workers that there historically, we haven't seen much evidence of this in the United States, though many, myself included, have thought that the severity and duration of the current employment problem could produce some observable hysteresis effects this time around.  Logically, one would think that at some point these effects much indication of any such effects.  And indeed, to long-term unemployed, you might say there's actually been a little bit of an improvement in

September 12-13, 2012

But again, as Janet said, basically, whether you believe that hysteresis is your policy prescription.  If you think that it hasn't you think that there's unlikely to be hysteresis and thus the cyclical aggregate demand.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. their performance, which would suggest that we're not sliding closer toward hysteresis, but that, once again, for reasons not entirely understood, the U.S. labor market seems relatively insulated from those effects. around the corner or not doesn't change clicked in to date but it might, that's an argument for greater stimulus now in order to stop it from happening.  If explanation dominates, then obviously the unemployment should be susceptible to increased aggregate demand stimulus.  So, in that sense, I think these arguments happily converge around the same policy prescription.  And for me, this all, again, reinforces the view that the story of the economy is still one of inadequate

Maybe incoming data have been mixed, but forward-looking indicators still remain consistent with an economy growing in the near term in 1½ percent and changed significantly; the general contours of my incoming data during the intermeeting period suggested modest increases in household spending and employment, and the household sector showed some further slight signs of improvement. But no data such an extent that faster business spending and consumer confidence, remain soft.  It is not even a of slack in labor markets obviate the need for a payroll employment only 55,000 higher than reported in July, after taking into account revisions-does not suggest above-trend economic growth or a declining trend in the unemployment rate.

Unlike downside risks emanating from the European policy after the fact-the potential hysteresis created by drops in the find the particular But, more optimistically, it is one downside risk that monetary policymakers do have some And this unsatisfactory risks to the outlook.  One particular downside we've been talking about-the depressed level of labor participation and the enhanced level of long-term unemployment. the recession is ominous, and although the Board staff predicts that over the next couple of the labor force participation rate will flatten out, the recession, as Governor may well have permanent effects on the labor force participation rate, just as the high-pressure labor market of the late 1990s pulled people back into the labor force a long time-only now, unfortunately, in reverse. proportion of unemployed workers having been jobless for long periods, we face an elevated risk that such a high level of long-term unemployment depress labor supply crisis and U.S. fiscal policy-which, were they to occur, theoretically can be addressed with accommodative monetary labor force participation rate and increases in long-term unemployment will prove intractable to address with accommodative monetary policy that isn't inflationary.  So I downside risk of hysteresis to be especially pernicious because it's difficult to address after the fact. ability to mitigate prior to its occurrence.

about the permanent or transitory nature of household and business year, that number had recovered, but now it has dropped down again.  Similarly, Similarly, I wonder expectations.  The economic outlook appears damped by some form of pessimism.  Look at the Michigan survey question on the proportion of households expecting unemployment to improve. Earlier this

It's difficult to project whether these expectations will getting too hopeful The longer we have an economy that looks bleak as far as the eye can see, the more this gets built into expectations.  Households and businesses now see a recovery slow to always have, but then things get better.  So households and businesses start to wonder if this is just a delay or if it's just households' income expectations for the coming 12 months have hardly recovered at recession despite the fact that actual income has somewhat increased.  On the business side, expectations for business conditions six months hence as measured in the Empire State and Philadelphia Fed surveys have dropped back sharply again.  In the case of the Empire State survey, they're back close to levels seen during the recession.  Capital spending plans also don't look great.

a few pieces of I was going to say. In trying to think about the factors that are leading demand to be so sluggish and about the channels by which monetary policy might be able to help, I've been struck by survey evidence.  Now, they turn out to be the same pieces of survey evidence that Governor Raskin was just referring to, thereby scooping a fair portion of what

And the gist of the is it low, but also, basically, it fell from 2007 to 2009, and it really hasn't In a similar vein survey, the Conference Board's Consumer Index, which also fell in August.  Very much to your point, they do a breakdown of expectations piece.  So I was with previous peaks of unemployment that we've had. I looked at were May 1975 and December 1982.  What you see is, at those times when you asked people about the present situation, it was dismal, you asked them about future expectations, it was not nearly so bad as it is today.  These are they're consistent with what I take to be the spirit of Claudia's MR. STEIN.  I'm really-on the Michigan survey, we had a very interesting briefing Sahm, in Research and finding is, not only recovered since.  Moreover, it's not well explained by household characteristics-there's a large negative residual there in a way that seems different from previous experience. but much less scientifically, I looked at a different Confidence the index into views of the current situation-a present situation index-and a future expectations piece, and all of the drop was coming from the future curious.

we are today and given the current situation, people feel slightly different implication because it's less clear that, if the fiscal gets fixed. work, which is, it's as if, given where the future is considerably more pessimistic.  And again, I think this is pessimism as opposed to uncertainty, which has a cliff resolves itself, this kind of thing

I just yesterday got a survey that Duke University way change their capital spending plans for a change in interest rates.  Here, it is strikingly like a large-sample version of President conversations, where only 3 percent of the firms say they would in any way capital spending for a 50 basis point movement in rates.  Now, I take Vice all, in this one, unlike consumer confidence, we don't would say in normal times.  But as a Bayesian, going on here, even though I wouldn't say it's a huge Another survey on the business side: does in conjunction with CFO magazine, where they talk to 900 CFOs of U.S. firms.  One of the new questions in there this time-I think, actually, Steve Sharpe helped them design this question-asked the firms if they would in any given Fisher's CEO change their Chairman Dudley's critique here.  First of have a benchmark, so I don't know what people I'm inclined to think that there's something thing.

guess the overall from looking at these various pieces of survey evidence is the sense that when we whatever effect we can have on consumer and effect we would have on financing conditions respects, the opposite of where we were in 2009 at the So, putting this together-now, this part is very impressionistic, but I feeling I get make a policy move now, we're playing more for business confidence than for the normal hydraulic per se.  That is to say, we may know more about how to move interest rates than about how to influence confidence, but it's the latter that, in some sense, is the dragging anchor.  This is not an 'always' situation.  I think it's, in some

September 12-13, 2012

time of QE1, when really the thing to do, the imperative, was to fix financing conditions, and people would figure it out one way or the other.

It strikes me that, if this is right, it how we think about the communications aspect.  I, like many others I think, less so than usual, the bond market is audience.  So maybe when we think about policy, we want to worry less about, how do we deliver a simple and coherent message that normal Fed watchers?  I think we'll have a chance to talk I have this have to think about our audience as being business managers and than at other times.  There's so much talk about, what are the Fed watchers I don't know if this has any implications for policy. should color particularly here, believe that the need for action is clear, but not really our primary about putting together the biggest, most inclusive package that has the maximum bond market impact, and worry more humans can understand, as opposed to mainly about some of these issues.  I'm not sure if this concept is fully operational, but conviction that we really households-more so expecting us to do?  And I think we don't want to get overly caught up in delivering just to them. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

status and outlook for the economy, and that can monetary policy do, and what should it do going forward?  And In that spirit, I propose to deprive the Committee of my events and proceed to the executive summary part of it, which really, that we've been on a round trip.  We had positive news early in the intermeeting I an economy with a substantial amount of slack that is growing at about 2 percent; MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It does seem to me that there's a decent degree of agreement, or at least overlap, about the the real question is, what I'm going to defer that to tomorrow. detailed recitation of intermeeting is, period, which was a trip to hope and back, and it left me very much in the same place where started:  I see

September 12-13, 2012

cliff begins to I am hearing is that there is little to no hope of action in the course, that depends on the arrangement of forces after the election, so it's Ultimately and most important, there is little, if any, reason to expect inflation that is bouncing around just below 2 percent on commodity effects, but close to target; and better financial conditions for now.  But as Europe improves, the fiscal approach in a serious way, and what lame duck.  Of completely unknowable. significant improvement in job creation in the coming months.

group of about 10 diverse industrial companies-this is not one of the real strengths.  The other parts of the industrial sector, let me and light vehicles, it's soft everywhere, especially in Europe. customers are postponing orders; they're not canceling them.  It's nothing like from 2008 to game is about share gain and taking out costs.  It's a low-growth environment. entire goods-producing sector of you look just at the manufacturing piece of that and a quarter, there was a net creation of 15,000 jobs, and two-thirds of that is auto.  I you hear, 'Uncertainty, uncertainty,' from all of these people, but they're really people who roll over at 4:00 a.m. to check German decision.  A particular company in the business had a big order from a German OEM for a beverage line, and global companies-it's really focused a sick feeling in people's stomachs My conversations with a autos, so it's away from say, are pretty weak, and they strongly confirm that last point about employment.  Outside of a couple of bright spots like housing Big 2009, but the softness that began about six months ago is now the new normal for these companies.  The All new projects are on hold, and there is no hiring.  In fact, the the economy lost 16,000 jobs in August.  If go back over want to say that talking about two different things.  These are not Twitter for the latest news from Karlsruhe on the beverage manufacturing that order has been pushed out at least a quarter.  That's uncertainty.  It's about demand.  As far as Europe relates to these companies-and these are pretty on demand.  The fiscal cliff is something different.  There's

September 12-13, 2012

able to function, and it's like last August that this is really bad, that this is our country not being on steroids-not that there's anything wrong with steroids.  [Laughter]  They've been very helpful to me lately.

to, again, do believe that we I can remember many of these cycles where you really wonder if this is it going to get out.  I really do feel that if you look at our own projections, going to have those 3 percent, 4 percent catch-up years. going to share this highly anecdotal evidence in an effort to end on something of a high note. Let me say where that leaves me.  The question that looms is-and I'm going leave aside monetary policy-when do we break out of this?  And I really will.  We always have. and we're never essentially, all of us project that we're They're now scheduled for 2014 and '15, but really, there's a ton of uncertainty around that.  So I'm always very world that has very few generally very conservatively positioned, and their to five-year period, and many PE a great time to buy.  In fact, a string of large equity.  There are three reasons why the private equity firms are feeling natural competitors, these big companies, are all frozen on the sidelines, game.  If anything, they're are very attractive, with low rates and issuer-favorable I talked to both private equity investors and hedge fund investors, and it's interesting to compare the two of them.  The hedge fund investors are in a really difficult environment.  They're traders who get marked every quarter, and, in a ways for them to make money, they're investor base seems to be fine with that.  Private equity firms are feeling quite differently about things.  They basically think about creating value over a threefirms right now, large and small, think that this is industrial properties, which would ordinarily have been expected to trade to corporations, has traded to private aggressive.  First, their sitting on their cash, ruled by risk-averse public boards, and out of the going to wind up being net sellers as the recession goes on.  Second, leveraged finance markets, as Andreas was discussing this morning,

days, and all of that provides critical case deals don't go well.  Third-and really the one that's relevant for this policy equity firms think about the medium term, and they see the future as better. firms are completely global; they each own hundreds of companies in economy and in every vertical; and they systematically mine the data that they get got the talent on board to do that.  This is not the private equity industry of 20 years really are.  It's pretty consistent, and what's holding was quite a similar pattern back in the early will recall, the S&amp;P lost about half of its great time to buy.  I would also add that they were 2005 and 2006.  So the question is, why take any signal from this, right?  I realize it group of investors with very successful and, in some cases, long track growth in the medium term, and they were willing to terms that are just about reminiscent of the bubble flexibility in exercise-private These large private equity every major and they've ago.  So they're seeing something.  They back the volume of deals is only supply.  There 2000s after the dot-com crash.  In that period, as many value.  We had a very soft economy in 2001 and 2002, a string of corporate accounting scandals leading to Sarbanes-Oxley, and a deflation scare in 2002.  Across the board, net sellers of businesses were on the sidelines, and the private equity firms were extremely aggressive during that period.  Those deals turned out to be, in many cases, some of the best investments in the history of the industry.  It turned out to be a net sellers in doesn't tell us anything at all about the next few quarters.  But I will say that it's a bit of a signal to me because this is a records that were looking ahead to strong put more than just an opinion on the line in that belief.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

There's great uncertainty a lot of activity-again, restrained only by a lack of supply.  When there's that's out there, the bidding is furious, and they're all saying, 'This is the time.'

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you.

I have two hours now. Let me summarize and just make a few comments.  Participants didn't see much the intermeeting period.  Economic growth is still sluggish. growth outlook is modest, and the recovery is in a holding pattern.  Output and growth are falling short of levels needed to reduce unemployment.  Headwinds for CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  I see [Laughter] change in the outlook, on net, during The near-term employment recovery include fiscal policy, deleveraging, tight credit, and international factors, including not only Europe, but also slowing in China.  Some felt that we risk a lost decade, but another view is that recovery has been consistent with previous experiences with banking and financial crises, à la Reinhart and Rogoff.

[No response]  I come after Governor Powell, so I have an more difficult task.  I'll try to respond a little bit to some of the comments that were made that is or below trend, and, by the usual Okun's law relationships, we're not Unemployment is about the same as in January, hours are also only about ½ percent higher than they were in January. improvement in the unemployment rate around year.  One interpretation of that is that it was a one-time payback for the rapid the recession. Any questions or comments? even today.  The basic outlook is, as everyone has pointed out, that we have an economy growing very slowly, at seeing very much progress in the labor market. and I note that aggregate President Bullard noted that there was a period of the turn of the drop in jobs during any case, economic growth, if anything, is slowing relative to earlier in the recovery. explain, understand, and interpret the very slow growth we've been seeing? discussed in the go-round.  One possibility is that there's been a once-and-for-all continuing at trend at about the growth going you eyeball earlier episodes of financial In Now, how do we That was also level shift, that we've dropped down to a lower level and are earlier pace.  So the suggestion there is that we are close to potential and output forward will remain trend-like.  This interpretation does not look implausible if graphs for GDP or consumption growth.  It is consistent with some

September 12-13, 2012

IMF has given this perspective a little bit of support.  The held by others around the table is that we remain well below potential. financial balance sheet, financial effects and the exogenous ones include Europe, fiscal, and the like.  So there was pointed out-are part of both have some truth in them.  As President Bullard return to the pre-crisis trend. crisis, and, among others, the alternative interpretation I think it's perfectly possible to rationalize that.  First, there have been ongoing headwinds, both endogenous and exogenous.  The endogenous ones include accelerator types of have been continuing headwinds, and, of course, sticky prices-as overlapping price-setting coordination issues and the like.  I think both of these interpretations are conceivable, and they probably mentioned, I don't think it's very likely that we'll little bit bemused by the appeal to is a strictly reduced-form observation, it has no structural reasons, including uncontrolled factors such as don't take that as a very convincing answer unless I understand better growth.  The second story does provide a exceptionally Lazear, who I don't think is to find a significant cyclical component.  It's true that the short-term a story.  It's possible, based on that above the longer-term natural rate at Now, on the permanent drop in the level, I'm a Reinhart-Rogoff because theirs interpretation, and it could involve any number of poor policymaking.  So I what the rationale is that is explaining the slower rationale, does provide an explanation.  Notably, labor utilization does appear to be low, and I won't repeat Governor Tarullo's comments, but Eddie necessarily inclined to find a cyclical source of unemployment, is just the latest of the majority of studies in this area equilibrium unemployment rate can vary.  There's no question about that.  Staff members have tried to include some of that in their analysis.  But we need kind of analysis, that the equilibrium unemployment rate is this point.  We don't know.  I want to emphasize that on all of these things-on the economy, on the effects of policy-we're incredibly uncertain, and we have to make decisions under

September 12-13, 2012

we can, given a very uncertain situation.  So, in that kind of world, of I and type II errors.  This is similar to what the Vice Chairman was saying. have been made that staying far away besides the cyclical unemployment. uncertainty.  We can't let waiting for certainty be the condition for taking any action.  We have to make the best choices course, there are type We are close to our inflation objective.  We're quite far from our unemployment objective, at least the longer-run unemployment objective.  Arguments from the longer-run unemployment level for a protracted period has its own costs temporary costs of the a good grip on those tools is very important, and that's one reason why we have been, as quick to use the tools as we might have been if we were using short-term as our policy tool.  But I feel that I'd like to thank the staff for the work that's been couple of intermeeting periods.  I think the work on market functioning, the In terms of our policy tools, I do agree with President Plosser that having the costs and the risks of in some ways, not interest rates done over the last work on financial stability-all of those things have made me more comfortable, at least, that we can manage the costs of these unconventional policy tools.

might as well take the advantage to talk a little bit about the policy tools and some great admiration for Michael Woodford.  I hired for many years, and I think he's a terrific was very useful.  I do the consensus in the literature about the impact of unconventional tools, won't go through an extended discussion, but I'll financial markets perspective, Now, I of the issues that have been brought up.  I have him, I coauthored with him, I was his colleague economist.  And I think a lot of what he said in his paper at Jackson Hole think that he understates particularly asset purchases, on the economy.  I make just a couple of observations on the empirical side.  He focused primarily on the eventstudy evidence.  He came to that with a Modigliani-Miller type of which has a lot of theoretical appeal but obviously is not empirically very successful.  It doesn't

September 12-13, 2012

But this asset purchases do have effects on financial difficult to measure the surprise component of I was very much involved in the literature on measuring the you have a futures market that can you what was expected.  Obviously, that's very difficult in the case of asset purchases, and you would expect the event-study literature, if anything, to bias down the findings, the event Treasuries on term premiums.  I would cite, for example, and Greenwood and Vayanos (2010), and this appears also in work by Gagnon, of research is based on no-arbitrage term Li and Wei paper that has been used a lot here at the Board.  So a number of different approaches, and again, I do think that the bulk of the these tools do have effects on financial conditions.  Obviously, there are issues rather than less effect. explain a lot of premiums, a lot of volatility, in actual financial markets.  So, using that perspective, he was inclined to dismiss the results from the event-study research. research does tend to find, almost uniformly, that conditions, notwithstanding the fact that it's very a change in asset purchase policy. effects of surprises in the federal funds rate, and there at least tell therefore impact of asset purchases on financial conditions.  But beyond that, in looking at only the studies, Woodford's paper ignores two other major literatures.  One is a substantial literature on the effects of relative supplies of Kuttner (2006) Hamilton and Wu, and others.  And a second line structure models, such as the there have been evidence is that about the transmission to the real economy, and I take some of the points that have been made, but there are factors there working in both directions.  For example, to the extent that credit markets are becoming less tight-standards and terms are becoming less restrictive-lower interest rates will have more effect

Woodford's paper, though, which I do agree with very much, is critical to managing monetary policy at the zero bound. we present what The central message of that expectations management is really And I agree with Governor Stein that the language is very important.  How

So I do I think I disagree that by itself it's we're doing is trying to signal that the Fed, rather than being pessimistic, is determined supporting the economy.  We'll be there.  We'll be a backstop.  We'll provide confidence. think that's a very important part of what our communication should be about.  Personally, I've learned something from both Woodford's discussion and that discussion around the table about how we should be talking to markets and to the public.  And a very small thing, but in my press conference statement tomorrow, I'm going to try to talk a little bit more to the average person than I have been, and try expect the expectations channel to be very important, but sufficient.

we'd keep rates low for three years. go?  For example, Woodford argues that a nominal GDP target, if essentially to make commitments many years in advance.  I'd like to question once again to the group because we looked very carefully at nominal a year ago now, I think, and there was really no support at that time.  The you'll stick to this a very extended period, many years, even though a nominal GDP target may involve a your normal range of inflation.  Moreover, of course, there's also A few people have talked about it.  If I'm missing I year ago was that while useful, are limited in that they The main problem is that we've already said that How much further out can we adopted, would allow us actually raise the GDP targets more than basic argument is that, in order to work, people have to be persuaded that target for period of inflation well above the risk that, if that happens, then inflation expectations will become unanchored.  So I think that was the case against nominal GDP targeting. something and you want me to hedge more when I'm asked about it tomorrow, which I'm sure will be, I'd like to hear that tomorrow because, again, the take of this group a nominal GDP targeting, price-level targeting, and so on,

September 12-13, 2012

And that's why I think one of the benefits of asset can be used as a concrete action, as a commitment device, to help credit for and more than I really said in my require credibility very far in the future. purchases is that they strengthen the expectations effect of announcements and communication so that they really are complementary-more than we have given them remarks at Jackson Hole.

are a lot of interesting issues here.  I think what I'd like to end on is just to come I know we're all in debating mode.  We want to persuade our colleagues, the correct responses are, or how our tools will work.  And I believe we context, using information that we have and we do, it's going to be a shot in the proverbial going to be very important for us to pull together, in a sense, to support efforts that we make.  Any questions or comments?  President Kocherlakota. So there back to the point that and that's certainly laudable, but the fact is that nobody really knows precisely what is holding back the economy, what all have to try to think hard about, in a Bayesian thinking about both the risks of action and the risks of inaction, what the best choices are, acknowledging and understanding that whatever dark.  I think, really, it's whatever remarks.  I helpful, but even more broadly, I certainly away from the Modigliani-Miller framework.  Our alternative A and alternative B, make reference to continuing to study the efficacy of LSAPs.  Part of that will have to be ongoing work and ongoing study of that linkage between MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Thanks for those found them very useful in my own thinking.  I, too, thought the staff's work on LSAPs over the last couple of intermeeting periods has been really came to the question of the efficacy of the LSAPs from the same Modigliani-Miller framework that Mike sketched, and I found the empirical work on the asset pricing side very informative.  It certainly shaped my thinking moving statements, the

If, say, tight can blame the Federal Reserve fairly, in my opinion, for being tightfisted and stingy and mean that we can't try to help if we think, in fact, that the benefit-cost CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let me make one comment on that, which is, you sometimes hear the following kind of statement:  'Tight monetary policy is not causing the problem; therefore, easing monetary policy won't fiscal policy is the problem, if that's the reason the economy is growing slowly, it doesn't mean that monetary policy can't mitigate that.  So I think that kind of argument needs to be looked at very carefully.  We are doing a lot.  We are absolutely doing a lot.  There's no question about it. Nobody not willing to take risks to try to support the economy.  But the fact that it's not our fault that the recovery is slow doesn't ratio is appropriate.

I'd like to do is let Bill English do his introductory remarks for tomorrow.  I'm in Bill and then start fresh at 8:30? What your hands.  The reception starts at 5:30.  Would people like to continue with the policy round, or should we just have

Both versions the forward guidance in a more positive light and in the context of making toward its objectives by indicating that, 'to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.'  Paragraph 5 then continues by shifting date of the expected commencement of policy paragraph 5  replaces the ′ timing of liftoff to the path of the unemployment inflation and inflation expectations.

I could ask Simon and the Desk-again, just to have a grip here:  What kind of market penetration will we have on mortgage-backed securities program of $30 and $40 billion per month?  You mentioned this earlier.  I apologize. MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, if factual under the

That's the flow rate relative to gross issuance. MR. POTTER.

MR. FISHER.  Yes, sir.

If we're about one-third right now, if we added $30 billion, we'd be MR. POTTER. about 60 percent; at $40 billion, we're about 70 percent.  But in terms of the stock, I think that would-what was that, Lorie?

the particular scenarios, but the stock I don't have that exact number, and it depends on the length, but just for was 36 percent.  So you the very upper bound. MS. LOGAN.  I don't have the exact numbers for would be 25 percent under the $30-billion-per-month pace, and it would be slightly higher under $40 billion per month. a maximum, under the $2 trillion scenario that we had run, the maximum that gives year-end, what will be our MR. FISHER.  And if we assume that we finish the MEP at duration?

MR. FISHER.  Thank you very much.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions?  President Bullard.

you, Mr. Chairman.  Bill, I just wanted to clarify since we have are three lines, and then alternative B you saying that this is a rough guide to what alternative B MR. BULLARD.  Thank a few minutes here.  When we do this on page 1 here, there has a couple of options in it.  Are would deliver?

Yes. MR. ENGLISH.

Or do you feel as though it wouldn't make too much difference which it just that it'd get too cluttered? MR. BULLARD. option is chosen within the subgroups that are proposed?  Or is

What we tried to do here was write down something that seemed alternative B.  Alternative B has a couple of different choices that the months after you've economy?  Do you continue purchasing into next year?  We've assumed that you MR. ENGLISH. plausibly in line with Committee would have to make.  One is, later on, what do you do in a few observed the

September 12-13, 2012

We've assumed, basically, that the forward goes out to mid-2015 and is compelling-everybody believes it.  It's possible, as I read that 6½ percent unemployment rate as pushing the liftoff even continue purchasing for about, I think, seven months in this.  And then the other question is, what do you do with the forward guidance? guidance mentioned, that because market participants' sense of the outlook is a bit weaker than our sense of the outlook, they may later.  If that were picked up, then you'd get a little bit more impetus to the economy out of that, but we've not modeled that here.

MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  And the other thing-I've been concerned about the withering of alternative C here.  Alternative C isn't mentioned in the graphs.

as you left the liftoff date unchanged, I'm taking out of that is the sense in the words in So the straight year.  That broadly is consistent with alternative C but maybe doesn't quite get the sense market participants. MR. ENGLISH.  Alternative C would be, as long pretty similar to the consensus forecast.  What alternative C that might hint that things could move more quickly than that. consensus forecast is no change in the forward guidance, no additional purchases beyond the end of the of what the words in alternative C could mean to

'Markets would be surprised.'  I accurate-they'd be very surprised by a statement like that-and that you probably effect.  Plus, if we were going in that direction, which I guess we're not, you'd of liftoff. MR. BULLARD.  Well, when you describe it, you say, think that's would have some have the possibility of moving up the date

MR. ENGLISH.  Right.

One important point here:  The black line-the consensus for the market because they pull back MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. forecast-implicitly has in it a significant disappointment

MR. BULLARD.  I see.  So I should read this as 'Consensus forecast/alternative C.' MR. ENGLISH.  Roughly.

guess, Mr. Chairman, I have a concern we have three options that are live options.  And I think it's been hard while the thing will happen.  But I think you want to have some things that are a MR.

Well, I whether Committee has been trying to think about ways to ease, and when the Committee shifts in the other direction, the same little bit tighter, a little bit easier, and might actually have a chance of-

Well, it's up to you.  But if you try to span the range of views, you able to MR. BULLARD. might have to put something on the table that's not going to be adopted.  But from my point of view, I'd like to see three live things that we could do and things that we might be maneuver around.

MR. BULLARD.  Yes.

Lacker. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President you, Bill. your help with understanding the second sentence in B(4).  I'm having trouble with it.  I you MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have two questions.  One is for I'd like don't think I understand it correctly, particularly the role of price stability.  So let me tell

September 12-13, 2012

way I read it.  It says, 'If the outlook for the labor market does not I read this, 'undertake additional asset purchases . . . as appropriate until such I think about that, if that going to still keep purchasing assets.  Have I got this wrong? what I think it says, the improve substantially' in coming months-so, if that happens-then we're going to do X.  So X, I think, is, as improvement is achieved in a context of price stability.'  As improvement is achieved but it's not in a context of price stability, that seems to say to me that we're

MR. LACKER.  I actually

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You pointed it out to him.  Okay.

MR. ENGLISH.  You're not the first.

We have poetic license here. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.

MR. LACKER.  Right.  You don't mean that literally, right?

It means that we're looking for improvement in a context of If we see improvement without price stability, that's not a good thing, and we CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. price stability. won't continue purchases.

It's 'subject to.'  That's really what it means. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

have-and I probably should have about the thought versus buying an equivalent amount of about is, all right, comparing those two options, undoubtedly forecast, as you've said, is that mortgage-backed security yields will be lower with mortgage-backed securities than with purchases of Treasuries, and that mortgage Now, my gut instinct is that some other rates will be higher.  And I've asked MR. LACKER.  All right.  The second question I asked this during our first agenda item.  I've asked this at times in the past.  On the table is a flow of purchases of mortgage-backed securities.  I've asked in the past experiment of buying mortgage-backed securities U.S. Treasuries.  What I've asked your purchases of rates will be lower. about this in the past, but did you do any work on that this time?

MR. POTTER.  Which rates?

LACKER. Aren't other rates going to be higher if we buy mortgage-backeds rather Treasury rates will be higher than they rates are linked to Treasuries and not mortgageIsn't there some other rate that's going to go rather than Treasuries? MR. than Treasuries?  Because presumably, that means otherwise would be.  Presumably, some other backed securities, and presumably, they're higher. up if we buy mortgage-backeds

Not go up, but go down by less. MR. ENGLISH.

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Go down by less.

MR. ENGLISH.  I think that's right.

with buying X amount of mortgage-backed.  So rates go downMR. LACKER.  Oh, okay.  Well, no-but, see, I'm asking to compare buying X amount of Treasuries

Lacker, we are still buying Treasuries under the MEP in this MR. POTTER.  President program.

September 12-13, 2012

Treasuries. MR. LACKER.  Yes, I know.  But instead of buying $30 billion of mortgages, buy $30 billion of you do $500 billion of Treasury purchases or a little bit smaller if yields decline by less.  They still decline.  It's still a purchase of a still taking duration out of the market and still putting downward goes down by more if you buy you buy Treasuries, because you're pushing MBS down more and mortgage rates estimate of the effects on inflation and output are similar in size. a little smaller for the MBS purchase, based on our modeling and our assumptions, than MR. ENGLISH.  I think the answer to your question is in table 1 in the options memo that we sent, which had an experiment where $500 billion of MBS-just one or the other.  The term premium effects are you buy the MBS, so Treasury longer-term security and pressure on longer-term rates, but by less.  The mortgage rate MBS than if down by more.  And our They're for the Treasury purchase, but they're in the same ballpark.

go down by less or are higher because you've been mortgage-backeds? MR. LACKER.  So what other rates tilting toward

In FRB/US-Dave Reifschneider will tell me if I'm wrong-I think, you you bought MBS. MR. ENGLISH. basically, that other long-term rates, corporate rates or whatever, would go down by more if bought Treasuries than if

MBS would provide less pass-through, in some sense, to MR. PLOSSER.  So the corporates and other things.  Is that the idea?

MR. ENGLISH.  Yes.

Depends on what you think the degree of substitutability them. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. is between

Yes, that's right. MR. ENGLISH.

LACKER. And the MBS, on net- MR.

MR. LACKER.  So that takes away some stimulus, right?

MR. POTTER.  Well, not overall, necessarily.

MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Well, it doesn't take away stimulus relative to doing nothing. It takes away stimulus relative to-

LACKER. Right. MR.

That Treasuries to MBS, and we've roughly maintained that ratio in MR. ENGLISH.  The argument we balance memo that we sent the Committee before the last meeting that there's roughly, that we were comfortable saying maximum amount has a ratio of these purchase programs.

MR. LACKER.  I understand.  Thank you.

September 12-13, 2012

That's the main argument.  There's a second argument, which we've run, but a lot of people believe that MBS could have effects that effects on house prices, bigger effects on mortgage or something like that. MR.

Now, I'd like views of what they think people are going to interpret that line to mean in going to be put out and the Chairman's press conference going to interpret that line?  That's critical-you have to you're really voting for, in some fundamental sense.  I know I'd love to hear your view. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. seems to me as though the key money line in B is, 'If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its securities and undertake to get staff members' light of, say, the SEPs that are statement.  How do we think people are have a view on that to know what it's judgment, but

MR. POTTER.  I don't think it will show- going to have our SEPs, and they're going to VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  They're have this information that shows that this unemployment rate trajectory-

The SEP will give them some information.  I don't believe that shows a be looking for sometime in 2013.  That's the way we've been modeling this, I think. like $600 billion of total purchases-is that MR. POTTER. substantial improvement in the labor market for quite some time.  So that means that they'll probably And the assumption you had, Bill, was something right?

MEP, it was $750 billion.  But, as I said is expected to be amount. MR. ENGLISH.  Including purchases under the in my remarks, it could easily be more.  People might see that the economy weak for quite a while; they might carry it out further into 2013 and get a bigger

For me, the obvious question to you, Mr. Chairman, at of 'improve substantially'? VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. the press conference might be, given the SEP and your views, what does the SEP forecast imply in terms

September 12-13, 2012

answer will be that we want to see-not what we saw Friday.  We want to see increases in payrolls.  We want to see some progress-not sharp have a sense that the direction that will help labor markets get better.  We used the word a factor in the outlook for labor example.  I think we have a fail-safe here, which is that if it doesn't have any effect, the idea would be that we want to see waiting-in-place kind of situation where there's no And I will emphasize that it's not a single indicator or a single trigger number; we're because it's the CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  My last progress, but some progress-in the unemployment rate.  And we want to economy is moving in a 'outlook.'  So a pickup in GDP growth would certainly be markets, for then we have the efficacy clause here as well.  But something different from the current progress, the unemployment rate stays about the same, and monthly payrolls are 100,000 and less. looking holistically at the labor market indicators and, in fact, more broadly outlook for the labor market that matters, not just the current number.

you'd have to see improvement in the labor market you thought would be sustained in the future. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So that

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Right.

For what it's worth, the Blue Chip forecasts for the going into the middle of 2013 are very flat   Then, in the second half of 2013, expecting to see a more noticeable downtilt in the unemployment rate.  So that's another looking at it. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. unemployment rate . they're way of or reasonable guesstimate, I guess. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So the market would presumably put in nine months more-that would be a

Again, it's the outlook and not the actual. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes.

September 12-13, 2012

going to ask you that as well.  What constitutes substantial progress? MR. PLOSSER.  I just want some interpretation of the word 'substantially' here because the market is

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Substantial progress means that we are seeing ongoing progress in the direction of improved labor market conditions.

not something about the magnitude of the rate of change. MR. PLOSSER.  So it's

It's not the magnitude, but really a movement in that is, I might say, persuasive or indicative that there is now progress in the right remaining static or getting worse.  President Lacker. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. direction that direction, as opposed to simply

MR. LACKER.  This is on the same point.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.

winter suffice?  Would we stop after that? MR. LACKER.  David Wilcox showed us employment in his forecast summary, and when they do all of the seasonal adjustment right, it looks as though half of the improvement we got in the labor markets this past winter or the winter before, was spurious, seasonal stuff. Would what we saw last dropped 1 percentage point between CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I would think so.  It August and April.

I'd be on board with that.  But his analysis suggests that that would be MR. LACKER. like another seasonal head fake.

you stop, you can't start again. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we'd look at a range of variables.  Of course, there's nothing that says if that weak, and we had this riddle. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  No, but last winter, though, it wasn't really convincing because, remember, payrolls were strong but GDP was

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We had this riddle.  Yes, that's right.

September 12-13, 2012

you wouldn't necessarily you didn't have the GDP growth to support the labor market. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  And so you could argue that stop last winter, because

MR. POTTER.  I don't think our outlook changed that much.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We basically want to see progress in terms of the key macro labor market variables.

Today MR. LACKER.  All right.  Well, let me ask Bill Dudley's question again.  What do you want the USA headline to be?

'Bernanke, the Hero'?  [Laughter]  'Federal Reserve Says CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. It Will Support Economy.'

MR. LACKER.  Okay.

you have a question, President CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any other questions?  Did Pianalto?

alternative B, paragraph 5 .  You said that some forecasters what is in alternative B as you look at your page 1, 'Alternative Monetary Scenarios,' that 6½ percent rate, as you mentioned, is about mid-2015.  I know we're MS. PIANALTO.  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  Bill, you made some comments about the 6½ percent unemployment trigger in ′ have slower progress on the unemployment rate, so they may view more accommodation than markets expect.  If Policy

September 12-13, 2012

you made those points.  You didn't say very much about the 'no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's B, we don't get above the 2.  At one point, we looked at some to the Committee's 2 percent objective.'  And I see that alternative B, close to our objective.  What are some of your thoughts?  Just as you the 6½ percent being interpreted by some as being more aggressive, given you've laid out here? trying to get away from the date, but inflation rate, because here it says 2 percent objective.'  When you look at those scenarios, with alternative anywhere close to 2½.  We're just slightly language that said 'close and even alternative A, is had some thoughts about would that 2½ percent objective be viewed as, again, more aggressive, and is it necessary the scenarios that

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It's not an objective, though, right? GOVERNOR YELLEN.  It's not an objective.

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It's not an objective.  It's just a tolerance level.  That's quite different.

a matter of perceptions also.  We're talking about Using 'close to 2 percent' would still give us the flexibility that's laid out in as though we're throwing out a number, whereas, 'close to' gives us some of MS. PIANALTO.  But it's communications.  And we've made a lot of progress and laid out a 2 percent objective.  What are the advantages? these scenarios, but we're not communicating to the public that we're throwing out ½ percentage point.  It seems that flexibility.

was intended just for clarity.  If 'close to,' everybody would ask the Chairman at his press conference, 'What do you 'close to'?' and try to extract that information.  People will be looking at the SEP, and above.  So I don't think they'd MR. ENGLISH.  I think the ½ percentage point buffer you said mean by the SEP shows inflation below 2 or at 2, roughly, but not going

September 12-13, 2012

a buffer.  There could be transitory shocks that would and say, going to go up as high as maybe 2½ for a little while, but after that, we think But you want to say explicitly '½ percentage point' or 'close to' is a question of a little clearer to say the number and not use 'close to.'  But this is a misread the ½ percentage point buffer as suggesting an intention to set out to push inflation above 2.  It would simply be seen as change the inflation outlook for a time, and the Committee could look through those 'Okay.  We're inflation is going to come back.  In the end, we're getting to our objective, and that's okay.' whether communications.  It's communications issue for the Committee.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Stein.

I ask one more press conference Do you envision that we'll still be continuing asset purchases at that MR. STEIN.  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Can question?  Suppose somebody says, 'We get to the end of 2013, it's December 2013, and we're exactly where we are today.  So the unemployment rate, job growth-everything is pretty much exactly where we are today. point?'

We must aim for a path that brings us measurably closer to our goals and inflation will return toward 2 percent faster than under MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative guidance on the funds ′ significant Such an outcome is simply inconsistent with the notion of appropriate monetary policy and, in my view, is unacceptable. over the forecast horizon, and we must take concrete actions that get us on that path.

There seem to be two arguments against taking meeting.  First, that it would be ineffective.  Estimates in Boston are that following would reduce in line with the Board staff memos and the consensus policy submissions from three other banks that reported a preferred policy that was close to A.  If accurate, this implies creating more than 1 million jobs relative to action is that it will cause inflation.  Again, with the Boston forecasting model.  Two of the Banks that provided virtually identical unemployment rates the Banks assuming the need for easing.  It would be interesting to discuss the and roughly consistent with the I view the risks of The second argument against more aggressive the consensus forecast exercise is instructive.  Among banks that provided numeric submissions, those that assumed further easing assume underlying inflation will remain well anchored.  This assumption is consistent numbers and assumed earlier tightening than we do have with and without tightening, but a dramatically higher inflation rate under the baseline policy. This is markedly different than the staff forecast, the DSGE models that we have seen, and models used by theoretical basis and empirical evidence for such an inflationary process, which I presume is tied to dislodging of inflation expectations.  However, absent a strong empirical basis for such an inflation process and with inflation tracking below our target staff forecast in models that assume expectations remain well anchored,

Well, presumably we would choose monetary policy so as to keep Now, we have to struggle a little about I'll talk a little bit more about this later, but for me I'm willing to say you had a price-stability mandate, then means keeping the medium-term outlook for inflation within 50 basis the price-stability I read B(5 ) is it's saying that the Committee has the option of raising the fed funds rate if it unemployment may well exceed our current estimates.  Here's how issue.  Suppose we only operationalizing that the medium-term outlook for inflation close to 2 percent. what 'close to' means, and that 50 basis points is close enough.  I would say that if promoting price stability points of target, 50 basis points below or 50 basis points above.  This is only mandate, and this is exactly the language about inflation in B.  In other words, the way alternative ′ ever perceives that it is not satisfying its price-stability mandate because inflation exceeds 2½ percent.

when we talk about this cost of violating its pricechallenging problem.  It provides Now, this is not a trigger, to be clear.  And we should be clear that it is not a trigger.  It's a threshold, and it's a threshold for conversation.  At that point, the forward-guidance commitment is no longer operational.  In some sense, we'd be back to business as usual in this Committee.  The Committee would have to weigh the stability mandate against whatever performance it's achieving on the employment mandate and decide what to do.  And those conversations would inevitably be interesting ones.  I actually think that B slices through what might appear to be a very valuable accommodation while allowing the Committee to be able to protect its price-stability mandate.

That is not what's going on in B(5 ′) . What's going on instead is going to hold off on raising rates until unemployment is lower, and that provides stimulus because people know that we won't be way.  This willingness to tolerate low unemployment is exactly how the optimal control works in FRB/US. of 2015, unemployment is 5¼ percent, the outlook for inflation is 2.3 percent-that's not what's providing the stimulus-and simulation is holding off on raising unemployment, to the natural rate. obviously just one of many models, but Keynesian model.  Iván Werning you leave the zero lower inflation at all in commitment to deliver on lower unemployment and higher output than you would otherwise think.

you're listening to me about the mechanism, you should be thinking:  If you've got with that.  I think we should be willing I said, I'm willing to go that far out, 50 basis points, but maybe one way of shaping a lines is to have a lower unemployment threshold.  That's a good thing; 'close to' enough that it could allow for 50 basis points.  But I put that Alternative B(5 It's a way to provide a credible mechanism to say we're going to be If such great inflation protection and low unemployment provides good stimulus, why not have a lower unemployment threshold than 6½?  I would agree to consider that.  President Pianalto raised a concern that maybe 50 basis points was too large a spread.  As compromise along those it provides stimulus.  And then have a tighter inflation-not even tighter, just say 2 percent, which actually is vague on the table as possibly one way to shape a compromise.  I think B(5 ′) is very valuable in this context. ′) provides an economic stabilizer, it provides inflation protection, and it's a credible mechanism. willing to tolerate low unemployment.

Governors Raskin and Stein talked about low expectations in the economy, to be thinking about is ways to bolster expectations.  Communication in that regard.  We often pay a lot of attention appropriately are going to be the main focus.  How do we explain these certainly have thought about this.  It's very easy to communicate the 2 percent, but we need a tolerance around that target.  I think every performance, but there's some you have around that as well.  Some people are going to say 50 basis points is too able to make a case about why we feel 50 basis points is appropriate, Yesterday that really what we have along the lines of B(5 ′) is going to be very helpful to the words in this room, and the words are important in what we say, but in something like B(5 ′) the numbers numbers to the public?  I idea that we have a target, businessperson, at least, will understand you have targets for tolerance that large, but we should be

given the kinds of shocks that could hit the economy on an ongoing basis, but the idea of having a tolerance is a very reasonable one.

As I've suggested, we could go lower, but I think 6½ percent says want to exceed it.  We're very prudent about minimizing any breach of that. Why 6½ percent? we're trying to minimize the possibility of being in breach of our tolerance range.  We have a tolerance range-it doesn't mean we the possibility of will wrap up at this point.  We'll hear, I'm sure, from others that the LSAPs have costs, about those costs.  I think the response to that is to try to as possible, and the language of B(5 yesterday.

We would be better served to take a more looking at economic data that

U.S. equity markets suggest continuing faith in U.S. expansion.  Long-term rates are exceptionally down the costs around the table here of walking farther into the so, and he has done a good service to the Committee in emphasizing there is a distinct possibility what happened during I am a little bit concerned about that based on the action that we are We may also be playing woods than we already have on balance sheet policy.  President Plosser has emphasized those costs, and I think rightly those costs.  One thing that hasn't been mentioned very much is that that we would be feeding into commodity price increases, which is part of the QE2 episode and was a bit counterproductive.  We could argue about that.  We haven't talked about it a lot, but likely to take today.

am not one that buys into the critique that monetary policy has been a long ways off past five years.  It is true that the economy is not performing as well as we would the fact that we are dealing with a collapsed aftermath of a financial crisis.  But the Committee, by all accounts, has essentially correct during the past several years.  So I am not one that thinks at this juncture. I target in the like.  There is a clear hypothesis for that based on housing bubble and the done a lot.  Much of it has been quite innovative, and the call of the Committee and of the Chairman has been that we are 90 degrees off from where we should be or could be action today, as encapsulated in option B, we can cite two things that do make I am sympathetic with as a rationale.  One is that we do have a global am concerned about it.  I think it is very legitimate to worry that that slowdown is affect the United State more than it has so far, and that that is a compelling argument for and taking aggressive action here.  That is one reasonable rationale.  And I For our some sense and that slowdown.  I going to getting ahead of that

I don't think we have as good a rationale as I would like to a move of this magnitude. also think we have some nothing like 2010 when all measures of expected inflation were down a lot further. see for

I have been advocating for a long time.  I hope that this will change in the outlook and the economic situation.  This will likely serve the Committee pretty well going appreciate that alternative B has that feature.  I am satisfied with the formulation Within alternative B, I do think it is a good moment to adopt a meeting-by-meeting approach to balance sheet policy that put us more into a mode that is similar to the one we are in under normal interest rate policy where we can sensibly adjust the policy at each meeting, given the change in the forward, and I in B with respect to that dimension.

you know, I have argued may not serve the in unemployment I am concerned that really can.  It is more monetary policy off generation to tie explicitly to unemployment and to promise that monetary policy can do a The story in Europe is exactly that there are structural problems that has remained very high for a very long time, and the governments across Europe.  It is one On paragraph 5, I definitely support 5 and not 5 .  As many of ′ that explicit mention of an unemployment number is a tactical mistake that Committee very well.  As Governor Yellen remarked yesterday, hysteresis cannot be ruled out in the U.S.  And I might remind the Committee again that Europe has not seen 6½ percent unemployment for a couple of decades.  Today it is over 11 percent in Europe, despite some major countries undergoing structural labor market reforms. we are telling the public that we can do more about unemployment than we labor market policy than it is monetary policy, and it could possibly throw for a lot about unemployment. developed over time.

We were just citing yesterday that the unemployment rate did fall, but it we thought was indicative of better labor market performance.  So you you feel like unemployment has gone down to a relatively low you are not very satisfied with labor market outcomes, and you still feel like the should be aggressive in that circumstance.  This is a problem that we have with all of of the story about the We would be better off to preserve the Committee's judgment In addition, I think there performance because all around the table here.

That's fine with me.  But I'm counseling against putting an Outside of the statement it's fine for various members to say, 'I'd really like to see unemployment come to here,' or 'I'd like to see labor force participation come to here,' or whatever other metrics thresholds.  But about overall economic performance.  So I'd have markets, if people feel like we maybe have been insufficiently we are explicit number on this or really any other data, to the extent we can avoid it, in the statement.

September 12-13, 2012

I have a few more comments-I think to be drawing.  We going to raise rates.  But if you cross the bound, you are implicitly sending a signal that going to do something.  I'm not sure the Committee has really decided that we would that circumstance.  Putting on my dovish hat for a minute, you are you are saying you will act if the triggers are violated.  I don't think we Kocherlakota was at least in part touching on not want to tighten at that juncture.  What if you don't want to tighten you giving that as the trigger?  That part to me has not been I can get my head around. And, finally, on this paragraph 5 -and then ′ thresholds or triggers like this draw lines in the sand that we may not want are all in agreement that if we are inside the bounds-say, 2½ percent and 6½ percent-that we are not you are actually do something in creating this thing where have really discussed that or really think that that's what we would do.  If inflation is at target, and unemployment comes down-and President this-the Committee may at that juncture?  Then why are formulated in a way that comment just for a few minutes on Mike Woodford's Jackson Hole paper, which survey of monetary policy at the zero lower bound.  If you haven't you have-the paper is divided into just two parts.  There is to commit to stay at the zero interest rate for longer.  If an antieffective, except to the by doing something Let me I do think was a seminal looked at it-and I know many of balance sheet policy, and there is policy you know Mike, you know that he is very pessimistic about balance sheet policy, being monetarist kind of guy.  He does not think balance sheet policy is very extent that it has a signaling effect and that the Committee is better served rather than just promising to do something.

at the zero lower bound for longer.  I agree also with the Chairman that the able to commit to stay at zero gets less and less you go farther out in the future.  That is something that is not well captured by the you start going out many years, so many things can happen over that period, in reality, anything.  But the main message I took from the an effective message, was this:  If you are trying to make this commitment to stay lot of central banks get the right type of commitment from the perspective of the model on staying lower what I took away from it was, the main danger is that continuing to commit up for the fact that maybe we have sent that signal, unwittingly perhaps, in some of our actions. Professor Woodford thinks that the only way to provide accommodation, in large part, is to commit to stay length of time that this Committee may be credible as model.  If that it is not clear that you are communicating paper, and lower for longer, it is a very subtle matter to get it right.  And he reviews a and a lot of central bank actions, some of which he characterized as counterproductive in terms of trying to for longer.  In fact, to later and later liftoff could be sending this pessimistic signal-if we don't do it correctly-that the reason we are staying lower for longer is not that we are trying to make we have been stuck at the zero lower bound, but instead it is that the outlook is deteriorating and is continuing to deteriorate in a very negative way.  And I think we have to be careful about that, and that am going to give a suggestion, not a policy suggestion, but a suggestion about the in my interpretation.  The you are constrained by the zero lower bound for a period of time.  Then, after you I proper way to think about this from Professor Woodford's perspective whole point is

September 12-13, 2012

time to make up for you were constrained during the earlier period of time.  My example about how we Taylor rule, which for us to raise rates today, but we would say, rates today.  We are staying at zero today.'  The reason we are staying at Woodford reason, which is that we were constrained by the zero bound years.  Therefore, we have to stay at zero for a while.  And it is exactly at that you gain credibility for the policy.  You are trying to make up for the zero bound at zero even though the data are telling you, according to the standard aggressive at this juncture.  You are staying at because you need to make up for the fact that you were at the zero lower bound for some would otherwise raise interest rates, you stay at the zero lower bound for a the fact that should think about this is as follows.  Suppose the Committee was committed to a Taylor rule the way John Taylor likes to use it-his is a much more aggressive and hawkish would even call for raising rates today.  And suppose everyone agreed on that.  This is just hypothetical, obviously.  And that rule would call 'We are not raising zero today is exactly the for a couple of point that constraint by staying Taylor rule or other Taylor-type rules, to be more zero time.

And certainly, if you look at the data, as the yesterday, on levels of real GDP or consumption, it looks like we are on a So to commit us to get back to the previous real GDP trend, which the bubble economy in the mid-2000s, I think would be a mistake.

My main complaint about nominal GDP targeting is that it ignores the possibility of what is likely an altered real GDP Chairman was saying different path than we were. is partly driven by and tried to get an analysis of you look at the price-level path established However, for price-level targeting, I have looked at graphs where we are with respect to the price level.

I thought expectations of forward guidance are In fact, I held my breath when I I had talked about the 7/3 thresholds, and I thought that forward guidance did deliver would LSAPs that you mentioned yesterday, Mr. Chairman, was I when you put paragraphs 3 and 4 together, plus the enhanced state-contingent in paragraph 4.

In paragraph 3, as that paragraph 4 makes this essentially open-ended by conditioning further improvement in labor conditions, joint with price stability, and with policy mentioned yesterday.  So there are important safeguards there.  It can be flexible and can turn around if in fact it is not working improvement, it would be unambiguously an improvement if we month for several with momentum or continuous improvement, got GDP growth above trend, those would be all of the markers that we would improving labor market.

This is a fairly dramatic change in the set of language we use to experience with the forward guidance earlier this year, where we got that we don't President Lockhart eloquent about this.  This makes us hostage to labor force participation rates.  We scenario-he sketched it out-in which employment picks up, and that growth that tails off and turns negative when the unemployment rate goes up, picks up when employment growth starts rising.  Given the behavior of the labor force over years, I don't think we should have a lot of confidence in our ability to project be better to write the statement in terms of the Lockhart was referring to.  For example, we 'This exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least I language that uses a specific numerical target.

This is not an unfamiliar phenomenon historically, in which labor force then the past several how the unemployment rate would behave in a scenario in which employment growth picked up a lot.

So the logic is The second opportunity We used the phrase that appropriate at least as long as' blah, blah, blah, 'provided that inflation at a horizon is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent objective and longer-term inflation expectations

Personally, I think the 'close to 2 percent' language would be better.  That's more consistent with the kind of standard we described in our consensus statement.  Proliferating confusing.

We've heard good arguments for it.  But is going too far too fast, that we are rushing it, and specifically to the 6½ percent unemployment rate and 2½ percent inflation cap over the one- to two-year horizon.  You have the phrase that 'longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored' attached to that, but my accepted medium-term or longer-term target of 2 raise eyebrows and doubts amongst our skeptics, and some question marks, no matter how we state it, in the marketplace.

you wish to proceed on this course, Mr. Chairman, my advice is to go with the B, not B .  Specifically, I would go with $30 billion, the lesser number. yesterday, it allows some ramping up in case the Committee decides, against like me-to do more.  A $30 billion program, if I understood the Desk on a flow rate basis means we are already taking down 60 percent of supply.

I would employing 'its other policy tools as appropriate.' I would add 'and well anchored,' another well anchored inflation expectations.'  We have it in B .  I don't see why it in B.  This is enough, in my mind, to bind the hands for some time to come for going to make it as I mentioned yesterday, even if we end up with a stronger than we currently foresee or imagine. I leave it more vague by simply referring to And after the phrase 'in the context of price stability,' great naval term, 'and ′ we don't have all of those who are with you in the wheelhouse of the ship we're steering.

a few comments about each of these. MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  There are two policy actions under consideration today.  One is additional asset purchases, the other is an effort to extend and strengthen our forward guidance.  I would like to make

I explained in the earlier go-round, I am not in favor of undertaking a new round of forecast has not changed enough to warrant further the Tealbook's simple rules on page 2, Tealbook B, including the rule, suggest that policy is approximately well calibrated.  Just like President urgency for large, aggressive actions at this time.  I'll remind the year as the economy brightened and the outlook looked patient, that we need to not react to short-run fluctuations. As asset purchases today.  In my view, the action.  Indeed, many of outcome-based Bullard, I do not see the Committee, we didn't move earlier this better.  We did not take action.  We were patient.  It turned out to be the right decision.  The economy then weakened.  But we seem to be anxious to do further accommodation every time we see weakness and not do the reverse as the economy strengthens.  The message I take from that is that we need to be of the economic shocks that have hit the economy.  The slow recovery, in curing what ails the economy are imprecise and tenuous at best. Board staff memo lays out numerous caveats and assumptions necessary in assessing The recovery is frustratingly slow.  The unemployment rate is uncomfortably and tragically high.  But, again, we have been told and we understand there is reason to expect this, given the size and nature in my mind, is not evidence that our monetary policy stance is inappropriate.  The benefits of further asset purchases Indeed, the the possible benefits of further asset purchases.

In my view, embarking on another asset purchase program at this time is years to come.  We should not best-guess outcome-a 50 basis point drop in the unemployment years. strategy.  Despite sizable purchases elevated.  But rather than question the efficacy of the policies, which would seem natural, our strategy seems to be to double down.  Now, the further sizable expansion of the balance sheet carries costs and will greatly exacerbate the challenges talked about a highly risky strategy.

But to me, this seems to run If we believe that the effects of purchases are through a portfolio channel, then the public needs to understand the stock of securities the Fed intends to simulation exercises, and I quote, 'reflects the strong assumptions that investors, priceand wage-setters all understand the Committee's goals and its stopping rule for the flow It is remarkable to me that the Committee has not been able to communicate to the funds rate even in normal times.

Fed may face balance sheet losses, no returns, no flows to the Treasury, or future, to the detriment of both households and the purpose of the balance sheet expansion is as a commitment device to exit, then we need to be communicative about what we are doing it, and we're not doing that.  How do we when we are reluctant to say so directly ourselves? If we get the reaction function wrong, and we find ourselves with ever-more larger balance sheets, the unacceptably large losses of some kind or another.  This could undermine our ability to implement an appropriate monetary policy in the businesses.  Now, if keep rates low for longer precisely because it makes it harder to explaining this.  We don't tell this to the public.  We need to be more we expect our policy to achieve and why expect the markets to understand this consideration, our forward guidance is for the Committee to that the commitment to do this is supposed going to be brighter.  The future is going to be more our models. those have expectations that are right.  But One needs to get the expectations right. This leads me to the issue of forward guidance, the other policy tool under either in conjunction or separately.  The intent of commit to holding interest rates lower longer than it normally would after the economy begins to recover.  The idea, as President Kocherlakota said, is to signal to households that the future is economic growth, higher spending than they otherwise might anticipate.  And this helps stimulate less saving and more spending today.  The strategy works well in many of Agents are completely forward-looking.  Many of implementation, in my view, is very tricky.

But it seems just and perhaps so far that has been the reaction, that they will read our economic outlook is going to be a lot worse for longer. won't work.  It will not bring spending forward. We wouldn't want the public to believe that we will let inflation run away from us, of course.  Michael Woodford has argued that there are ways given us two examples-an at Jackson Hole, nominal GDP targeting. not the conceptual idea.  First, it presumes that households and businesses our guidance as reasonable to assume, actions as a signal that we believe the The public does not have that positive outlook, and if we don't convey that to them in very strong language, the strategy strategy requires us to manipulate the public's expectations in a very particular way. follow the strategy requires placing a ability to communicate.  You will recall that this Committee decided not to ago and did not adopt nominal GDP targeting when we reasons, one was what the right level of real GDP needed to be.  We found those both either risky or This That's the communication challenge with this strategy.  To lot of weight on our adopt price-level targeting not too long had the opportunity to do so.  And we rejected those for a variety of communication and, of course, with nominal GDP targeting, one of the major issues was defining difficult communication strategies.

agree with the staff assessment that large-scale asset purchases have been effective. LSAP program was effective at the early stages of the financial crisis when financial when it was launched back into a recession an outright deflation was very real.  Our LSAP programs provided circumstances, I see the benefits of another LSAP program as being far more limited. I Our first markets were in severe distress.  Our second LSAP program was effective in 2010, a time when financial stress was still significant, the risk of falling was high, and the risk of strong support to financial markets and helped to appropriately realign inflation expectations.

So after putting together my thoughts available tools and considering my large round of asset purchases along the lines of Tealbook.  That option called for the immediate launch of an asset purchase program until labor market conditions substantially improved, and the purchase program was committed to run at least through mid-2013.  That option also called for an extension of the forward guidance on the fed funds rate through mid-2015.

I'm of the view that easing has also been a powerful tool for reducing long-term at this juncture is liftoff and not to launch a significant monetary policy through forward guidance interest rates.

I still have reservations about some of the specifics of the proposal, the version of B that is now under discussion offers the possibility of an acceptable way forward. B does call for expanding our holdings of long-term MBS.  Because some I like While alternative For one thing, even though alternative securities in the next several months, it does so through the acquisition of research does suggest the MBS purchases can be more impactful than Treasury purchases,

B also allows for the possibility that the Committee might I was going to suggest some changes to 'the Committee will continue its purchases of agency context of price stability.'  But I do like President Lockhart's 'may' in front of 'undertake additional asset purchases and employ its I think this flexibility of phasing in more accommodation in various ways as One option in alternative deploy tools other than, or at least in addition to, large-scale asset purchases if in coming months we conclude that additional easing steps are warranted. the second sentence in paragraph 4.

I think it's very helpful to spell out the goal of the program and to articulate the halting those purchases.  In particular, we our outlook for and costs of the program changes significantly.  The an open-ended program is that its effectiveness will depend on market guidance on conference, emphasize our commitment to continue the program until we and sustained improvement in labor market conditions. I support the open-ended alternative economic conditions we'll need to observe before should promise to add accommodation through asset purchases until the outlook for labor market conditions has improved substantially, and we would stop doing so only if inflation or assessment of the efficacy challenge with such expectations of the ultimate size of our asset purchases, and we're offering no clear how long we expect them to continue.  In addition, we've included some escape clauses relating to efficacy and costs.  I, therefore, think it's important that our public communications, including the Chairman's press have seen ongoing

challenges in shaping that market participants should adjust their Even though the open-ended nature of the program creates expectations, it also has the very desirable property expectations about the size of the program in response to changing economic conditions.  And this means that the program should induce stabilizing movements in financial conditions as expectations adjust automatically to incoming data indicating a stronger or weaker economic outlook.

But in not a I supported both the original program as accommodation move.  If the MEP does the job on long-term rates, without increasing the size of our balance sheet or drawing the same criticism as drawing criticism, the MEP might also be less visible and thus less likely to engender confidence effect.

And given that we haven't, even if you thought it was, how would it Presumably, it would manifest itself in tightness in the labor market and rising going to pass through into our inflation projections.

But manifest itself? wages, which are 'Okay.  We are now seeing that the trigger or threshold has been breached.'

I don't think that is something to disregard.  It is probably something good arguments piled onto the 'why we all hate the date' argument for you of the year-hesitant to move in that direction I thought they were significant last spring, even in the LSAP initiative, which is going to take a little nimbleness to explain.

One, the communications issues, which several-most recently Betsyhave alluded to, are significant here.  But absence of an confusion with the policy statement-what do these numbers actually mean-is a real consideration.

The calendar date, as we have heard, is working of the future.  Why not, instead, show households, businesses, and markets what we are looking for in terms of particular to see before we begin contracting?  With such a preview and credible delivery, households and businesses and markets figure out how we keeping the panes of that window clean, reduces volatility and pessimism about our commitment to support a recovery.

Forward guidance that is dependent on an economic outlook counters these pervasive such interpretations and perceptions, the more pervasive, credible, and intractable they become. In short, we want to oxygenate the forward guidance before households permanently harden their expectations about both the future path of the economy and our future reaction to it.  All of this argues for moving all seen that in optimal control simulations under commitment in the FRB/US inflation never rises these particular thresholds.

Have we really deviated from our previous forward guidance in the sense that now we are making do something that we would stick with, even if statement, well, that we've introspected, we have have discovered in our souls that we have a different reaction function than we previously knew ourselves to have?

The a hard-to-parse statement in other areas, it could end up being somewhat work on it.

I had in mind when I said it was already a You get a flavor of this in some of the comments that have already gone you I hear it, read paragraph 4 as a quite strong and open-ended commitment to continue long as it takes until the labor market improves.  At the other extreme, I heard President Bullard reading the paragraph was, 'Well, it doesn't really say much we are.'  You can the truth is sort of in and a little bit in the eye of the beholder. With respect to paragraph 4, this is the part little bit hard to parse. around.  In other words, it seems like it is really open to different interpretations.  Some of have, as doing asset purchases as the way more than that we will do this for several months and then reassess where certainly point to various forms of wiggle room in the phrasing.

We will see, presumably in a few months, whether that pass-through is might want to update one's policy based on that. understanding of the costs and the benefits, and that in spite of the fact that benefits of past programs have been significant, I sense that we returns territory. a particular kind of market feedback that we might get reasonably quickly, which is to say-and Governor Duke mentioned this-there is this issue about the pass-through from MBS spreads to primary mortgage weak or strong, and one yesterday, given the language in paragraph 4, this makes you were floating yesterday struck a good balance here, so I was certainly In any event, as we talked about the press conference important.  For what it's worth, Mr. Chairman, I thought that the trial balloon answers that comfortable in that dimension.

I think it is worth giving serious further I also-very similar to President Lockhart and to President Pianalto-was there is an alternative framing that would work here?  And my thought asset purchases or a change in our guidance. Given these two earlier points, one being that thought to 5 , and the second being that there is some virtue to not getting overly locked in on ′ asset purchases, thinking about whether was maybe we can lean just as far forward, or even a little bit further, on the general principle of giving accommodation if the economy doesn't strengthen but be more open as to whether that accommodation would take the form of way the press conference is handled.  In the former case, if it's done via the 'If the context of price This could be done, in principle, either by rewording paragraph 4 of the statement or simply by the statement, you could rewrite the two key sentences-it's just a suggestion-as follows: outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue to add further accommodation as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a

In determining the nature of such accommodation, the Committee will, as always, take account of the likely efficacy and costs of the tools at its disposal.'

The intent is not to back stability. appropriate and away from being supportive but to be a little bit more flexible in the tools that are used to provide that support.  Thank you.

I will say that the two things that need to be good news is there are only two things.  The bad news is those two things are, first, agreement on the desirability of moving to a state-contingent I'm very open to the intellectual appeal of that, but going around the table, around the levels in the language and I and vetted about 5 ′ done-the the Committee has got to reach forward guidance. it's quite obvious that we don't fully have that, particularly the conditionality.

My own estimate of the liftoff date every day, and our proposed The idea that the date can contain a negative, I view of this is that the market moves the guidance doesn't contain any surprise element. contractionary aspect is certainly plausible in a different setting, but not on the facts we face today.

LSAPs.  As I look back on the use of LSAPs so evidence supports the view that the effects of any LSAP are highly enhancing confidence, confidence that bad outcomes will for good outcomes. Let me say a couple of comments about far, I too believe that the dependent not only on some mechanics, but also on the setting in which it is launched.  The main driver of real effects is probably that of be avoided, and that there is reason to hope alternative B is that it is limited to MBS at a time as welcome support for housing as well as for the economy.  So presented, it stands a decent chance to actually be noticed and appreciated housing in our public communications around In this view, it is really our credibility, the design of the program, and the setting that make it work.  For me, an argument in favor of when the housing market is consistently surprising on the upside.  This alternative can be well explained and understood by the public broader by people who are neither Fed watchers nor professional market participants nor economics bloggers.  I encourage an emphasis on support for this action.

B can have positive effects on the economy but that these quite modest, and I do come to that view without a great deal of certainty. LSAPs have affected asset prices, and to deny that does call for-as My view is that alternative effects are likely to be It does seem clear to me that

[Laughter] But of course, affecting rates that actually matter channels through which we believe our policies operate and the caveats, meeting, my strong sense is that the real effects will be quite modest, The last two I've seen both from well known, credible sources who happened to be broadly of unemployment effects of around 20 or a couple of months. Looking at the confidence intervals, headwinds, and multiple uncertainties that surround the estimates so well addressed in yesterday's and it is all too easy these days to find credible private forecasts that agree. forecasts that supportive of accommodation, point to estimates 30 basis points for a program the size of QE2-use that as a rough proxy for this.  That would be 300,000 to 450,000 jobs under those forecasts.  That might be equivalent to bringing the recovery forward by

I also agree with President Bullard's point earlier in the aggressive monetary policy.  As a separate yesterday, I do not feel that additional aggressive to provide much of a solution. As far There's likely benefits is right, one want to proceed with a large meeting that the problem has not been the lack of matter, taking the Chairman's points from monetary policy is likely alternative B with a certain lack of enthusiasm, and I am are on.  As others have mentioned, this is not I know that every member of the Committee struggles to balance these highly uncertain costs and benefits.

The date implicitly rests on some unobserved variables, and so people essentially have to look at the date tell them what those variables are?

That reduces the downside risk and actually means, at the end of the day, the prospect is that we'll have to do less rather than more because we'll be supporting confidence today by am very sympathetic with a number of people's remarks that don't put a power of additional LSAPs.  I think LSAPs have modest effects on the equity foreign exchange market but not one-for-one as in the staff projections because whole portfolio balance framework, which is the basis for LSAPs. All that said, I very high weight on the level of long-term rates, and the drop in long-term rates does feed through partially to the market and the that would contradict the

assessing the effect of past LSAPs, I'm not particularly a big fan of event studies.  I reaction on particular days.  The expectation of all the factors that affect financial that we're going to do an LSAP, that not only affects people's views going to happen in terms of financial markets, but also signals a view about our view of those things affect financial asset prices.  So trying to disentangle is of the LSAP from what the effect is of our judgment that we need an LSAP is determine. In think the event studies are too focused on the LSAPs evolves more slowly, and it's very hard to disentangle asset prices.

During the heat of the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 when we were rolling out these special liquidity facilities, I was very impressed by how much our policy confidence in market function just because we were showing up, just because the fire trucks were

People, as doing what we're doing, but they feel more effective and the core acting we're somehow removing responsibility from others where the sits, and I think there is some truth to that argument.  In an ideal are outside our purview would happen that would help the economy.  But arguing against action for two reasons. Some around the table have argued that our tools are not very problems lie elsewhere-in fiscal, the household balance sheet, housing problems-and so we shouldn't act because by responsibility more rightly world, other things that I don't think that argument carries the day for

your mandate the best you can.  And second, if we don't act, it's not I really don't accept the premise that you really believe that, then maybe you I don't think many people around the table believe First, nothing in our mandate says that if our tools aren't powerful, don't use them; defer to others.  There's nothing in our mandate that says that.  It just says this is your mandate.  Use your tools to try to achieve as if that somehow is going to cause others to act. somehow our inaction would spur action by others.  If could actually advance this argument.  But that our inaction will somehow spur action by others that will improve the economic outlook.

At the end of the day the staff has concluded that we have the holding back.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On the agency MBS, I strongly favor the $40 billion per month over the $30 billion. Being more forceful makes sense. room to do $40 billion rather than $30 billion without impairing market function, so I don't really see the reason for your good advice. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you, and thank you all very much, as always, for

comments.  I think that action is needed.  I don't think we're extended the MEP.  Both Let me make a couple of being precipitous.  We extended the guidance in January.  In June, we

The evidence is that while we are not necessarily also true that we seem to have stalled, and that very improving.  Given our mandate, I think that requires at least a very clear, is a cautious action. alternative B actually MBS for the rest of the year, and then three or will be looking-in a way that wasn't our fixed-size LSAP programs-at what's happening in the data and economy.  But I do think there is a basis for expressing our support for a bit more The action that is proposed here, and it should be Governor Duke was very helpful in helping me think about this.  What this does is make a down payment of X per month of four job market reports from now we will consider at that point what the job market outlook looks like, and then respond appropriately.  So it is, in that respect, emphasizing the conditionality of the program and the fact that we conveyed adequately by what's happening in the the economy at this point, to help support confidence and to help give the economy strength in case we do face shocks from Europe or from the fiscal cliff.

I propose alternative B.  I'll come back to the body of it in a a pretty clear consensus around the table that there's a lot of from the date toward some kind of state-contingent guidance.  I think paper whose author's name will not be mentioned was that clarity about powerful tool and one that we should make use of.

The advantage of doing $40 billion is, first of feels a little underwhelming to me in terms of what we announce today, but we are looking at it, seems like a more plausible number view is that it's consistent with both capacity and with market functioning even if extended for a long period, longer that we would actually do it. In $40 billion a month, but I'd like to add the words 'through the $85 billion a month three lines from the bottom.  The $85 billion, which is the MEP plus the $40 billion-of course the MEP runs out at the end of the looking at how we're all, that $30 billion also it seems to me that one of the options we might have in January, if would be just to continue the $40 billion.  To me, $40 billion there.

To summarize-and I look around the table, if there are any voters who bothered, please let me know-I would propose to choose $40 billion and $85 billion from the third line from the bottom, propose to insert the phrase 'through the end of the month,' and then in paragraph 4, I propose to take the second option, 'undertake additional asset purchases, President Fisher.

I just ask a question?  When we say 'in a context of price stability,' well-anchored inflation expectations, is that correct? MR. FISHER.  May we also mean phrase.  I recognize it's not completely as we undertake our policy. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We do.  That's the grammatical as President Lacker pointed out, but the implication is that, of course, at all times we'll maintain that conditionality

paragraph 4, just a thought to throw 'price stability,' so would be to frame this whole question of continuing It seems to me comprehensive.  It refers to improvement in labor market conditions also of course, efficacy and cost and all of that.  I can see combining those two and that might make that good set-up.  I'll also point out that in all likelihood, the minutes are going to portray given some consideration to threshold thinking, and so this would serve to frame MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Because it refers to the time horizon, wouldn't that kind of 5?  In other words, I thought for you were suggesting taking that and putting it at the end of 5. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. language be more appropriate as we look toward the language of a moment

LOCKHART. I'm actually thinking it might fit in 4.  I put this on the table a little additional asset how long we're going to do that, we'd take into account the pace of conditions and so forth.  In determining the size, pace, and composition, as always, take into account efficacy and cost.  I just saw that as a boxing of all of the things we would we go to essentially an open-ended kind of approach. MR. bit off the top of my head.  The Committee will continue its purchases, undertake purchases, and employ its other tools until such improvement is achieved in the context of price stability.  In determining labor market we'd take into consideration if

That would be more logical.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Go ahead.

LACKER. In the forward-guidance language, we deleted the economic conditions of 5  and that language, but I'm thinking that what you had in mind by economic conditions clause was in part motivated by his critique as well, the idea are.  The intention, as I read you, is for us to be communicating more about our reaction MR. clause there.  We've had a lot of discussion of Professor Woodford's paper.  We've talked  a lot about that in the context ′ deleting the that by saying it's conditions that are pushing the time horizon out, we were focusing on how bad things function.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That's right.

September 12-13, 2012

a question I asked earlier this year.  When we adopted language, we never really got clear on whether it's a commitment or not.  We wrestled with going to pursue an action that MR. LACKER.  I want to re-ask this different versions of what that meant.  Is this signaling that we're later on we would not want to pursue then?

and so on. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think it's still conditional because it obviously depends on the timing of the recovery

MR. LACKER.  Right.  So it's contingent.

I mentioned the SEP changes and so on.  I think we in a way that credibility is an approach to dealing with the zero lower bound, not in an CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  But around this table have moved to the view that communicating low rates for longer may require some extreme way, but I think there is some of that now in the statement.

LACKER. We have a statement, and we can walk away from this and each interpret we're doing.  Is policy in the going to be Is the fact that we said this going to alter future policy? MR. it in our own way, or we can have a Committee sense of what future to be conditioned on this?  In other words, as Woodford suggests, is policy history-dependent?

I said the zero lower bound, and implicitly I said the am conveying, I think, some sense that in order to achieve more stimulus today, there's a bit of gone too far out on a limb on this. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  In my Jackson Hole remarks, I talked about the guidance.  I said it was conditional, dependent on the state of the economy.  But in explaining the time, we look at rules and optimal control and those sorts of things, but we also take into account some other factors such as downside risks, the effects of possibility that the equilibrium real rate of interest is lower than normal-that is, headwinds.  So I a commitment element there-I don't think we've

SOMA the FOMC your of the second paragraph. MS. LOGAN. 8   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will offer a brief description of how the Desk plans to implement the Committee's decision regarding the portfolio.  Consistent with recent practices, the Desk intends to release a statement with operational details on this initiative at the same time as the release of statement.  A draft of the Desk statement is provided in the handout for reference, with the exception that we will add the clause 'through the end of the year' into the second sentence agency principal payments.  Our current projections indicate that through year, paydowns on the agency debt and MBS portfolios will result in reinvestment purchases of roughly $30 billion.  Thus, combined Based on the directive, the Desk intends to expand the SOMA's holdings of agency MBS by $40 billion per month and maintain the existing policy for reinvesting the end of the average monthly

will initially total around $70 billion per month and constitute about threegross issuance. purchases fourths of monthly TBA

Should the purchases extend for 10 months, as was considered in Tealbook B, we anticipate that the SOMA's ownership share of the outstanding fixed-rate agency MBS market would grow from about 18 percent to 27 percent, and that's over a 10-month horizon.

current practice for reinvestment operations, the Desk plans to in the newly issued securities in the to-beThe Desk may purchase other agency MBS if In line with the conduct the additional purchases announced market, or TBA market.  These securities represent the most liquid sector of the MBS market, allowing purchases to be made in large size and are most closely tied with the primary mortgage rate. market conditions warrant.

The Desk intends to conduct these additional purchases internally as we've been doing for some time rather than relying on an investment manager to conduct the trades on our behalf.  We expect to be active almost every day, and purchase operations will continue to be conducted in a competitive auction format with the primary dealers.  Further, the Desk will continue the practice established at the end of last year of margining the unsettled MBS transactions with the primary dealers.

Dollar rolls or accelerate the delivery of purchases based on indications In the reinvestment operations to small, at Given the substantial portion of issuance being purchased and the uncertainty associated with MBS supply, the Desk will continue to conduct dollar roll transactions when necessary to facilitate the settlement of our purchases. can be used to postpone of the availability of agency MBS for settlement. date, the size of dollar rolls needed to postpone settlement have been fairly about 5 percent of purchases, though this amount is likely to increase with the additional asset purchases.

where persistent supply problems suggest that settlement of purchases, We will also use coupon swaps, if needed, to facilitate settlement, as was the case in 2010.  A coupon swap would allow the Desk to exchange unsettled purchases in a given agency MBS coupon for other coupons more readily available for settlement. However, we do not envision needing to conduct such transactions, except in very rare cases even over several months, is unlikely.

agency MBS securities under this new asset purchase program going forward, one for the new purchases and one for the continued along with Treasury MEP operations around the last business day of a pro rata share of the monthly pace in September of about $23 billion. The purchases of will begin tomorrow.  We plan to have two separate announcements for MBS operations reinvestments.  The Desk will publish the monthly asset purchase amounts the announcement of the each month.  Given there are only 17 calendar days remaining in September, we will purchase

comments.  Thank In addition, we will continue to publish around the eighth business day of each month the planned amount of reinvestment purchases for the next month.  Thus, there will also be a new reinvestment purchase amount target posted today at the same time as the Desk's operating statement is released.  That concludes my you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Any questions?  President Lacker.

LACKER. Help us interpret financial market data going forward.  What do you TIPS, should we factor something in about TIPS MR. expect?  Because our purchases don't include yields?  Are they in the habitat, out of the habitat?

LOGAN.  Yes. MS.

LACKER.  Okay. MR.

weren't proposing to do it in the overall asset purchase program,

MS. LOGAN.  In our MEP purchases, we purchase TIPS today.

MR. LACKER.  You do?

MR. POTTER.  The MEP is still ongoing.

MR. LACKER.  But we were we?

Sorry? VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

MR. LACKER.  Include TIPS.

LOGAN. If we had added purchases under a new asset purchase program for MS. Treasuries, we would have done so.

LACKER. Okay.  You would.  Sorry.  I misread something then.  I apologize.  Let yields? MR. me ask another question.  How linked is the private-label MBS market to agency MBS Do you anticipate this pushing that spread apart?

would affect the Treasury term premium, and to the extent that the pass-through from MS. LOGAN.  I think the way we've been estimating these effects is that the MBS purchases the lowering of interest rates moves other asset markets, equities, or the private-label market-

September 12-13, 2012

we would expect the guess there could be some other form because it is MBS, and we talked about what that pass-through is.  There's some uncertainty, but channel to be through that form.  I private label is a little bit more closely connected than maybe from Treasuries to private label, but overall we have been expecting the pass-through to happen through lowering interest rates more broadly.

Again, in the spirit of things that are cooking out I think the Home Loan Bank of Chicago is country, not just that are in district, and feeding them through Redwood to try to generate some more broader I would expect that to the extent that that might be helpful. MS. DUKE.  I'd just like to say something about the private label almost no issuance of private label in a number of there.  There is there, the Federal Home Loan Banks, particularly now looking at consolidating jumbo securities from banks across the the Chicago private-label issuance, for jumbo and more broadly. happens, it certainly wouldn't be unhelpful.  It that compared with buying Treasuries yields by more-Treasury yields will fall, but not as much as tilting the playing field away from MR. LACKER.  Well, but what they're saying is only, this is reducing agency MBS what they would fall if we bought Treasuries only.  They're everything priced on Treasuries toward agency MBS.

Lacker, we're still buying $45 billion of long-term Treasuries MR. POTTER.  President in the MEP right now.

September 12-13, 2012

LACKER.  Yes, I know that, but the apples-to-apples thing is $40 billion agency going to be higher, given that we're buying agency MBS, than they would be if we MR. MBS versus $40 billion Treasuries in this setting, and comparing those two, private-label MBS yields are were buying Treasuries only.

would be even less created now. MR. LACKER.  Well, they actually think we know very much about what would happen to yields because there's so little issuance; there's so little pricing information. I don't think we know because there hasn't been much issuance there and we don't MR. ENGLISH.  I don't private-label MBS It's conceivable that pushing down agency MBS would also push down private-label MBS yields, but have information.

MR. POTTER.  The stronger the housing market is, the more it should support the private-label market coming back and having more capacity.

Let's go on to the consensus forecast.  This, of course, is going to do.  You have in front of consensus forecast.  If you turn to page 3, and we look at the forecast inclusive of the guess, by the line that says, 'Plus I'd like to do is ask each person to say CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. 9 still an exercise.  We're still working to figure out what we're you the policy action today, that would be best approximated, I $750 billion LSAP program.'  That's the post-action policy forecast, and note that it includes the jointly determined federal funds rate at the bottom.  What

September 12-13, 2012

you broadly agree with the forecast as given or you agree with back a second.  As part of our exercise the staff, I believe, is intending to you agree but with reservations, they will write up your reservations in minutes style were that people raised about the forecast.  The you just disagree with the forecast, you should say so and explain why, and monetary policy report with attribution-that's the plan-and say, you disagree about.  Yes, President Lacker. one of three things.  Either reservations-let me go write up our discussion as if it were a quarterly monetary policy report, and what they will do is if describing without attribution what the concerns other possibility is if then they'll write up the again, what it is that understand.  Are these two different plans or are these two MR. LACKER.  I don't different options for us?

MR. ENGLISH.  Two different options.

choices.  When I go around the table, you CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You have three have three choices.

can disagree anonymously or with attribution? LACKER. Modestly and anonymously. MR. LACKER.  Right.  We CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You can disagree modestly and anonymously. MR.

Or is it a trigger? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You can disagree violently and for attribution.  [Laughter] MR. LACKER.  And there's a threshold.  [Laughter] MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Can I bring up just one more thing?

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.

circulate it back to the Committee. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  For those people who strongly disagree, we're also asking them to submit in the next few days-by Monday-a paragraph or so explaining why, and we will eventually put this into a document and then

September 12-13, 2012

Is everybody okay? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.

the $750 billion LSAP program, and in voting for alternative B, I didn't year, would that be a reservation?  I just want it.  What does 'with reservation' mean? MS. DUKE.  Can I just ask one question about agreeing with reservation?  If we're comparing it with assume that the purchases went past the end of the to know how to characterize

I think you assume that you should take the Tealbook you would anticipate, given the policy action taken?  And if CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. assumption here, the $750 billion, and say:  Would the economic path shown here be a reasonable approximation of what not, why not?

MS. DUKE.  Okay.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay?  President Bullard.

I agreeing that this is a consensus forecast or am I agreeing that and where they're not. MR. BULLARD.  Am this is actually my forecast?  Because I submitted my forecast. And you can see point for point, you know, where they're different you yourself find itCHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We're trying to determine if it is a consensus, and therefore, we're asking if

enough?

MR. EVANS.  Is it close

MR. FISHER.  I'm trying to remember my specific numbers.  All I remember is that I was in the central tendency.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.

MR. TARULLO.  Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sorry.

everybody would have written it somewhat differently, but in the end can you kind of go MR. TARULLO.  I think it's not unlike what we do with policy statements, which is to say along with it?

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes, that's what it is.  That's right.

forecast?  Do MR. FISHER.  You said there were three questions.  Do we agree with the we have reservations?  If so, what are they?  What's the third?

Do you have a fundamentally different view? MS. YELLEN.

MS. DUKE.  Do you disagree?

whether you agree with the policy action or not.  This is conditional on action.  Conditional on the policy action, do you agree more or less with the forecast CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Do you fundamentally disagree with the forecast?  And remember it's not about the policy that's been presented?

you earlier? MR. FISHER.  And if we have reservations, we should submit them.  Is that what were saying

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, Janet, would you like to comment?

If you broadly agree but have some reservation-you're slightly more a different view on oil prices, but aside from that you agree this is a reasonable forecast contingent on the policy path-then say you agree MS. YELLEN. optimistic about the forecast, you have basically

September 12-13, 2012

people have expressed some The staff will write up will be a few paragraphs they'll submit, and that will with attribution.  This would be a portion of a monetary policy supported the forecast without reservation.  Several people had are the your views are essentially with reservations.  And the write-up, as in the minutes, will say reservations, but nevertheless associate themselves overall with the view. the discussion of what the reservations were.  But those who just have a basically different view of the forecast should say so, and then there be included in the document report where there would be a discussion of the diversity of views.  Think of this as a diversity of views and say 10 people reservations of the following sort, and four had essentially different views.  Here submissions.  In your paragraph, you'd describe and explain why different.

Let me just make sure I understand.  We're assuming the CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. policy path, this policy action?

Yes. MS. YELLEN.

doing today. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Yes, that's what we are

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Right.  So we're not having individual 'appropriate monetary policy.'

No.  It's just given what we passed today, is this a reasonable MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. forecast?

MR. LACKER.  Wait.  That's different than a policy path.

I'm going to suggest something slightly different from what you look at the numbers you may think it will end up being $500 billion or some other numberMR. REIFSCHNEIDER. Chairman Bernanke said, which is:  Given the policy decision today, if that go along with that $750 billion LSAP program-forget about whether the $750 billion is correct or not because

September 12-13, 2012

Is it close enough for talking purposes?  But if you economy is just going to look a lot different, so you want to, in effect, dissent, then you're in the third category.  The middle ends are very clear. do you think that's a reasonable forecast? think this is the wrong model of the world, the much so that category is a little tougher, but I think the two

Everybody, this is a trial run.  [Laughter]  We're trying to may have already found out what doesn't work. comment or question or you're okay? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. find out what works and what doesn't work.  We President Fisher, did you have a

fine.  Vice Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You're

My question was would it be better to try to have a little VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. bit better understanding about what 'close to' is or would it be everyone's personal view of what 'close to' is?

your judgment of whether you sufficiently disagree that your name identified. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It's you want to have have different way, but you could argue that you think the standard error is more than X, then you should disagree, or you could be a for very minute changes. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  But it does matter if people disagree or parameters in terms of how close is 'close to.'  We can do it either if perfectionist and you disagree

you would like the sense of the Committee reported is CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So all of this is about reporting.  We're trying to report the sense of the Committee, and so how basically the question.

Right.  If we were really doing this, the Chairman would be walking out MS. YELLEN. into a press conference with these numbers, explaining the policy action, and putting these

LACKER.  Well, put it this way:  Are you willing to write two paragraphs for Dave MR. Reifschneider?  [Laughter]  That's it, right?

a fundamental VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  No, no, that's different.  That's disagreement.

The way I would put it is this.  If the consensus forecast came would say, 'I want to make an personal unemployment rate forecast at the end of 2015 would be oneyou have reservations.  [Laughter]  But if you perhaps feel about making a big distinction about one-tenth or so, thenMR.

Is it a good consensus?  I do think it's a good consensus.  There are forecast and the policy assumptions.  The way I did it was years, and then I applied the outcome-based policy rule, fine as a statement of where the Committee is, and I would endorse it in that sense.  As a rule on this whole process, I don't think that it's a good thing to get into the business of are zillions of points here and a lot of subtleties here. MR. BULLARD. issues here about the mix between the I had more inflation coming in the out which would then have the funds rate moving in a different way from here, and so the policy assumption then starts to also look different.

I have heard several people category two, and if you end up saying, 'We've got a FOMC had qualifications on it,' I'm not sure it becomes. MR. TARULLO.

One, the issue that arose are action that really isn't any have a feeling-is already who might have fit themselves into consensus forecast-14 of the 17 members of the how powerful

You can just frame it as where with Betsy on the fiscal restraint. and it will be more problematic to the outlook, so we have somewhat weaker That said, I think this is a pretty much do you disagree? forecast, but if

I agree.

all, coming into this, on appropriate policy, I was weaker in couple of tenths.  And I saw inflation a couple of tenths stronger, closer to 2 percent year or two, getting to 2 percent next year.  So I would have put policy to raise Modifying that in terms of making it a forecast of the Committee's action, I would MR. LACKER.

If you are a year earlier, is that a significant reservation?  [Laughter] I'm sorry. MR. BULLARD. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sounds right.  Anyone else?

Based on the original line of comments where we asked you to that had higher inflation, I would have were a 'three' because you showed that, conditioned on sticking with the August you're a three.

So I would have said that

I don't think I am outside of these confidence bands. MR. BULLARD.  But

I don't think that is relevant.  It goes back to the question of, your forecast, from a policy perspective, would be materially different? MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. do you think that

MS. DUKE.  Okay.

One possibility, which Governor Tarullo alluded to, is that we can't do this in a timely way because policy action is going to be soon enough, in which case it might be something that only appears in publication with the minutes, for example, three weeks later.

agree with Governor Tarullo, by the way.  He makes an excellent point. It probably would be difficult at this juncture. MR. FISHER.  I My next question would be:  Could you summarize what we just discussed as though we were at a press conference?

I would say that this is the forecast few agreed with the broad contours, except they pointed out a few issues related to the fiscal cliff the efficacy of policy.  President Lacker.

LACKER. I'm a little confused.  Someone used the phrase 'a diversity section.' you, at the beginning, described-I think you did in this context-a minutes-like document, clear on what you guysMR. But and in the minutes, of course, when they discuss participants' views, the different views are sort of woven into the main narrative.  I wasn't quite this five minutes ago myself. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I just learned about

LACKER.  Okay.  Great. MR.

I think the plan is to have a document that describes the gives its main feature, and shows it in a minutes-type discussion: 'The Most agreed with it but raised the following points anonymously. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  But consensus forecast, Committee discussed it.

LACKER.  Okay, we will just have to start. MR.

current plan is to talk about this exercise in your plane reservations now.  [Laughter]  The next meeting is TV in Library, and lunch is available if you would like to stay.  No presentations are much. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  I hope this was helpful to you all.  [Laughter]  Just so you have something to look forward to, our October, so be sure and make Tuesday-Wednesday, October 23-24.  The press conference is at 2:15.  There will be a the Special planned.
