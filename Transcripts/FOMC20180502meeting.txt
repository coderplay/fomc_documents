In particular, as highlighted in the middle-right panel, the funds rate declined only 1 basis point compared with an average muted decline in the effective rate on yesterday's April month-end. Quarter-end typical in effective federal decline of 9 to 10 basis points on recent quarter-end months.  We also observed a more from past quarter-ends when volumes along with rates, federal funds volumes actually increased $14 suggests this was driven mostly by an increase in borrowing by banks that borrow below IOER in accounts and earn the spreadAdditionally, in a notable departure typically declined billion on the March quarter-end.  As you can see in the bottom-left panel, analysis by the staff primarily motivated by IOER arbitrage-that is, banks order to deposit those funds in their Federal Reserve and that these IOER arbitrage volumes typically decline on quarter-ends.

difficult to identify the underlying motivation with precision, and banks may have multiple motivations for on market outreach as well as staff trading activity using the detailed FR 2420 data.  Although the the interpretation of I should note that, in practice, it's for federal funds trades borrowing.  The breakdown shown here is based analysis of classification is somewhat speculative, we think it can help recent market developments and may also provide insight into how federal funds activity might evolve.

Indeed, as shown in the bottom-right quarter-end, federal funds volumes have fallen since late January, coming from firms we classify as borrowing for IOER to borrow primarily for reasons other than IOER arbitrage, such as to manage area. It's not clear why arbitrage-related borrowing would have the March quarter-end, but recent months might their panel, other than at with most of the decline arbitrage, represented by the light blue area.  Meanwhile, volumes for firms that appear funding needs or as a way of meeting their liquidity coverage ratios, have been relatively steady, as shown by the dark blue funds transactions for IOER arbitrage is the fact that Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs), which provide of federal funds loans, cut back on federal funds activity and investments in repo because of higher repo rates.  Recall that a the effective federal funds rate trades below IOER is because the FHLBs, they become less willing to lend federal funds at low rates. We think the broader reduction in federal stemming from about 95 percent increased their primary reason why FHLBs can't directly earn IOER.  If more attractive alternative investments become available to

As we look ahead, balance sheet and the resulting surveys expected the spread between the effective rate and to narrow but for the effective rate to remain below IOER through As I discussed earlier, spillover coming from been the main driver of the recent rise in the effective federal funds rate.  An increase in the effective rate that is a result of FHLBs finding more attractive investment opportunities is not necessarily an indication of don't see however, a range of factors are likely to exert further upward pressure on the effective rate, including the ongoing normalization of the reduction in the supply of reserves.

By top of the target range, you would make it possible for the funds rate to remain within the target range even if it moved IOER. First, the memo discussed a potential technical adjustment administered rates rates on top of the target range while keeping the setting IOER below the effective federal above memo noted that such an adjustment could be made 'in conjunction the target range'-in which case the IOR rates would be increased than the target range and the overnight RRP rate.

I know they've reached out put some respect to federal funds rate trading near the top of the range, we worry about it to funds rate will systemically trade above the top target range, which is currently bounded, obviously, by the IOER rate.  I agree with Vice we should avoid its occurrence, letting the funds rate depart from the targeted range would cast doubt on our ability to accurately.  And I think that's an important aspect of this.  It may force us to the IOER and the ON RRP rates reactively.  The latter could be done at the Desk's With the extent that it increases the probability that the of the Chairman Dudley that it's not an excessively likely event.  But because implement policy adjust discretion, as was mentioned, but the former does require Board approval.  It may also require frequent changes as conditions in money markets change.

It would issues related to our operating procedures in and market forces make it increasingly difficult to operate a Currently, the levels of excess just simply too large to operate policy in this way effectively.  However, work corridor environment could occur at fairly high levels of reserves-not as high as their levels, but maybe higher than we have previously thought. The memo raises a number of important general.  The first is if regulatory floor system, we may wish to reconsider a corridor system. reserves are jointly carried out by the Philadelphia and New York Fed economists indicate that the transition to the current

But, in order to guarantee an our operating regime to a corridor system.  As sheet continues to normalize, that decision will ultimately confront us. The second is that be desirable the overnight RRP market itself.  That would require, in my mind, much more study and preparation, but So my inclination is to continue operating in the active market, we may eventually wish to change the balance in the funds market appear to be manageable using the RRP, but with slight adjustment with where The current funds rate behavior seems to be driven by a run-up in government debt, more attractive asset for GSEs.  With a in the federal funds market, the effective funds rate has risen as well.  The rate may need to be set, as Vice Chairman Dudley and others have said earlier, a few basis the target range.

I wondered if, either Vice Chairman Dudley or the staff little more about this happen again, and why they are think that lowering the IOER federal funds volume going away.  I think the dynamics that going to drive the federal funds volume to decline are irrespective of lowering IOER.  I think is happening in money markets.  And money market conditions MS. LOGAN.  Just to go back to the first question, I don't rate would change the probability of are those dynamics are about what

funds rate up to or slightly above the IOER rate if we make the change relative to the target range. could evolve and could push the federal make the change or if we don't the key issue here is that it's natural for the effective federal funds rate to IOER rate or slightly above, and I think the challenge was just that the of the target range was set at the IOER rate rather than being set slightly above it.  If it's funds effective rate can evolve naturally, slightly above or setting was set at the IOER rate when technically rates should trade slightly above the right setting of the range relative to the administered should be a one-time adjustment. I think potentially come to the ceiling set slightly above, then the federal below, and you wouldn't have to make any adjustments.  So I think it was just because that initial IOER rate in a floor system.  If we have the rates, it

is one of whether it would be in bringing the federal funds rate down.  So, remember, we transact in the repo market of reserves, it's possible it would filter through to them.  But, with $2 trillion of the system, you've got to ask, why hasn't the supply of reserves filtered through to that point?  Adding a typical open market operation-it might be $8 billion in the old I'm concerned our understanding of how to do an open market operation of first time we did it, we might look quite clumsy in trying to achieve the that we want. MR. POTTER.  And the open market operations issue effective only.  And if we had a small amount of volume in the federal funds market and it was banks that were short reserves in them at style-is very small percent, and you could try and do open market operations of a larger amount.  However, that amount, and counterparties' willingness to be involved, would be something we'd have to learn over time.  So the outcome

it was likely the federal funds rate would move closer to the top of the target range.  And, in fact, that that we were establishing effective monetary MS. BRAINARD.  Yes.  I think going back to our discussions leading up to the Normalization Principles and Plans that we released in September of 2014 and the addendum that we released in March of 2015, there was a lot of discussion recognizing that effective was viewed as something that would be a sign policy control with the new framework.

the staff alerting us to the likelihood that as part of that process the effective top of the range in a way that I think would be The proposal to reduce the level of the interest rate on reserves 5 our taking action proactively.  And I think it will be very useful to provide a window thinking in advance, through the description of today's discussion in the minutes of this I appreciate funds rate could actually move to or above the confusing to the public.  And by alerting us to it early, it provides us a useful opportunity to address the risk in advance. basis points below the top of the target range seems like a sensible approach to me on its face, and I favor into our meeting.

the interest rate on reserves at a shifted upward-I prefer the latter.  Otherwise, as the memo points out, the could be misinterpreted as introducing a small rate cut in an environment in which it to expect continual gradual increases in the path of rates.  By contrast, at a target range, it should be easier to explain to the public that this Of the two options that are presented-either lowering meeting when there is no adjustment to the target federal funds rate or at a meeting when the entire target range is Committee has led the public meeting with an increase in the is a small technical adjustment.

That said, I think once we move with this, about I don't

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Thank you.  Governor Quarles.

But interesting things that have been put on the table, I do think that this is a fairly than later.  I I understood it before.  I now think I understand it better. MR. QUARLES.  I had not expected this discussion to be so interesting.  [Laughter] despite all of the technical adjustment.  I support it being done.  I support it being done sooner rather think that the explanations and response to President George's questions actually were very helpful to me.  I thought there's a hike or a meeting at there isn't a hike, I actually think that the most important thing is that it should be done at it will be the same thing.  But the principal issue is that of communications, and I accompanied by a rate hike, but it has to be can talk about As for whether it should be done at a meeting at which which a meeting where there's a press conference in which the Chair can explain it.  Now, in our current universe, that's the same thing, and because I think that it should be done sooner rather than later, think this could be communicated when not communicated, and so I'm supportive of doing this soon and when the Chairman it.

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Thank you.  President Mester.

adjustment, I'm okay with it.  The memo laid out some reasons with those.  But reason to do it at a meeting at which we're going to raise the target range for the federal really important to underscore that point.  What in the past is true, that our monetary policy is set by the FOMC-by setting that rate, which of course is a tool set by the Board of Governors, to get the funds rate within the target range.  So I have a strong preference that Regarding the technical why you might want to do it when you're raising rates, and I align myself another funds rate is a governance issue.  I think it's we've said target range-and then the IOER will be adjusted we take advantage of that and underscore the governance.

operations for that rate.  But I do think that the broader question ultimate framework is going to be is something that we need to think about.  And I we do it sooner rather than later, because I think there are a lot of issues involved may seem like a technical discussion, but are more than a technical discussion.  Thanks. I guess I would be a little bit reluctant, perhaps, not to use open market reason.  I would rather do that than adjust the IOER of what our would rather that

Williams. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Thank you.  President very much the same things as the Vice Chair, Governor Brainard, and Quarles said-I see the primary issue to be one of clearly and consistently current time. MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I found the IOER memo actually very clear.  I'm going to say Governor demonstrating control of the effective funds rate.  That is our target rate at the

basis point range bracketed by the rates on overnight reverse like to go back to those discussions in which we were very focused on making sure that we and to the public that we have control over short-term that we were in, was basically to guarantee The original design-a 25 repos and IOER-served us extremely well in that regard.  And, like Governor Brainard, I would also were communicating to the markets interest rates.  That whole design, in the environment

May 1-2, 2018

we could raise rates when it was appropriate and control rates in a a complete success.  As Governor Brainard pointed out, we the right way to set up these ranges or these relative positions of these and would evolve over time.  So now, funds rate likely trading very high in the range for the foreseeable future and eminently sensible to lower the IOER rate somewhat below the memo. that we could show that reasonable fashion.  And it has been also thought that administered rates would depend on market conditions with the effective even in danger of reaching it, it's top of the range as suggested in the meeting when we're raising range and when there is a press conference to describe this action.  And I agree with about the importance of aligning, as we have, the idea that the FOMC is setting to achieve the FOMC's decision. all this is about.  The FOMC says we want the funds rate to trade in this range. a way that best achieves that consistently over time. Now, from a communications perspective-and I agree with everybody that this is probably the most important part-I do think this is easier done at a the target President Mester the policy rate and that the administered rates are set in order That's what These administered rates are set in

think it makes sense to raise the point increase in the meeting.  Of course, this assumes that we don't see a reversal in the of the funds rate trading high in the range in the meantime.  Again, it will be important to technical modification in the execution of our framework, which we laid out in these earlier documents, and that additional of a shrinking Federal Reserve balance sheet.  In terms of which is the better tool to To avoid a potentially confusing, unintended breach of the target range down the road, we should not delay taking this step too long.  In particular, I rate on IOER 20 basis points in conjunction with our anticipated 25 basis target range at our next pattern communicate to the public that this is a purely monetary policy modifications like this may be necessary as conditions in money markets evolve, especially in the context

May 1-2, 2018

this goal of supporting the execution of monetary policy, I think that adjusting over time less expensive way to do this than trying to use achieve the administered rates is a more effective and open market operations.

just mention is that I don't see this as something that we would be are relatively slowBut again, going back to our discussions of a few years ago, I going to see the funds rate trading at or a little the IOER rate.  And if you remember these discussions, it was somewhat surprising this floor was as soft and permeable as it proved to be at the time. The last thing I'll having to modify frequently.  These changes in money market conditions moving-I hope.  [Laughter] think we understood that the success of this was bit above that think market participants-and my own views are that, as we shrink the balance sheet and as other market conditions to make one or two more of these adjustments.  But, again, I see it as a the policy we laid out back in 2015. If you look at the Desk survey, I aligned with this-expect evolve, we may need predictable part of the execution of

others, will chime in that I do think it's getting to be time for us to have that discussion about the long-run policy implementation framework.  But I as separate from this technical decision that really is just made in support of the Now, I, like more significant, deeper view that execution of the framework that we are following now.  Thank you.

Evans. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Thank you.  President me add my agreement to pretty much agree that we should make a technical adjustment in the IOER and it would be best to do it at a time when we're increasing the funds rate. MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let everybody's comments so far.  I rate,

And I think that we should dust during the long-run framework discussion so that we could be better prepared if nonarbitrage trading in the funds rate framework.  We should be proactive in that regard.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Kashkari. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Thank you.  President you support making this adjustment in June.  I think you said 'assuming it reverse itself between now and then.'  But what are the odds of that?  Is it possible that a now, or three months from now, we're going to regret having made this decision? MR. KASHKARI.  Just a follow-up question.  President Williams, you said in your comments that doesn't month from

It hasn't reversed itself so What Lorie was trying to point out is that some of the dynamics in the federal funds market to be changing, so we've been looking at it each day.

dynamics in the Treasury securities market were to take back all $500 billion of could come down, but the overnight RRP is still a the bottom.  So it wouldn't require any change.  I think the issue we were just to deal with is that the federal funds rate should be, in theory, slightly above the IOER that wasn't the case, and so we're just trying to create MS. LOGAN.  Yes, I think it would because the overnight RRP has been a very solid floor.  So if those bills, by way of example, those rates very solid floor at trying rate.  And because of our financial system, a little bit of room so that that could happen.

that if all of the IOER arbitrage trading went away, the federal funds and idiosyncratic, and that rate could jump really high, well range.  But in that world, you'd probably be thinking about the way you were monetary policy stance, because the federal funds market would be so small Now, it is possible market could be very, very small above the communicating the at that point.

MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you.

Rosengren. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  President to follow up on Lorie's last point.  So if you figures 17 and 18, and you just take out the light blue so that all you have is the dark blue, a market that basically doesn't exist, and we've tied our monetary policy to it.  And it's a amount of funds that we're talking about; the end-of-the-quarter volume would be technical adjustment, but I do think that we should more fundamental discussion about what happens if the federal funds rate trades interest rate on excess reserves, and all of a sudden this arbitrage goes away, and now, the administered rates that are determining monetary policy.  So I think it's fine for MR. ROSENGREN.  Yes.  I would just like look at it's very small very, very small.  I have no objection to the be having a above the really, it is

May 1-2, 2018

it's a bigger problem, and we probably should have a broader future meeting. this set of meetings, but I think discussion of it at a

Bullard. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  President table.  This was a constructed system in which we wanted to stick to the federal funds as the announced policy rate.  As President Rosengren just pointed out, and others have, too, very thin market.  And it was a difficult decision, I think, on the part of the Committee to a matter of tradition, and so that's where we came down. MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with much of what has been said around the rate it's a stick with the funds rate, as opposed to going to some other rate as being the actual policy rate. But it's

the IOER rate, because the soggy I haven't heard rate up closer to the IOER rate and have the communication to say that this floor it continues to go away, that we're not as worried about that as we past, and we don't have this target range.  And we're not so concerned about exactly funds rate trades, because it's a thin market, and it just trades somewhere IOER rate.  That would be a perfectly fine way, in my mind, to run monetary policy. a lot of options here.  I have no problem with the technical adjustment.  But as issues here. I would take it as good news that it is trading closer to floor problem was the one we were trying to address.  A simple thing to do that mentioned here is that you could bring overnight RRP them all trade closer together.  You could change problem has gone away or, if were in the where the federal around the So there are everyone has pointed out, there are a lot of

I'll say that I do appropriate the next time we raise the federal funds rate to raise the IOER signaled in the minutes of this meeting as a that we'll also stress when the increase happens. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Other comments or questions?  [No response] agree that it will be rate 20 basis points, which will have been carefully technical adjustment-a point

is the case for a number of you, this memo and our discussion we probably should bring forward in time our discussion of a longer-run policy had been thinking wasn't going to be 2018 business and we had plenty of time.

a while, that the staff thinks that relative to trends.  But in Tealbook A, also look at manufacturing utilization.  It's still low relative to the past 30 or 40 years.  I'm sorry to pick on you, representing Tealbook two?  Because I would have thought that if firms were really they possibly could, because they'd have no Is there a way MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Bill, a question on the staff's outlook and forecast.  You mentioned, and it's been in the Tealbook for we're running above potential in terms of the labor market we just curious-you're the guy sitting there, so I'm A-how do you reconcile those scarce workers, they'd be using all of the capital choice.  And yet we see a gap in manufacturing utilization-or capital utilization. to reconcile those two?

One way is to think about the different sectors of the economy.  I manufacturing has had some adverse demand shocks associated with the MR. WASCHER. think one reason is that

May 1-2, 2018

that's one reason that the growth in manufacturing economy. strengthening of the dollar, in particular, and has lagged the growth in the overall think manufacturing has been on a long-run structural decline, and to be scrapped.  So there probably is an excess being used.  But it's being offset, in our view, in terms of the overall in the labor market and in the economy. More generally, I sometimes it takes a while for the capacity capacity there that's not economy, by tightness elsewhere

because of big productivity gains, but that we're still domestically or around the world. MR. KASHKARI.  But-correct me if I'm wrong-I thought the perspective was, manufacturing employment declines manufacturing goods whether manufacturing output in overall output has declined as well.  I Morin is in the back and may have something to add. MR. WASCHER.  I think, overall, that was certainly true for a long time, but maybe over the past decade or so the share of think Norm

manufacturing employment has and decades, and it's also the case that the manufacturing share gap between capacity utilization and other measures of slack is that in the 2000s, with the grown reasonably slowly, and in a industries capacity hasn't been shed as quickly as demand has declined.  So you have industries MR. MORIN.  It's absolutely the case that the share of been trending down for decades of value-added has also been coming down.  But I think Bill hit on the main point that one reason for a China shock and so on, demand for manufacturing output has number of a large number of industries in which capacity utilization is very low among other where capacity utilization is at more-normal levels.

a variety of hypotheses accounting for a secular decline in average relative to In addition, there are capacity utilization across industries..  For example, with capital becoming cheaper

MR. KASHKARI.  Thanks.

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Thank you.  Governor Brainard.

Yes.  I just wanted to ask about the analysis of term premiums and this period of very low term premiums seems likely to be and we seem to be in the for your view about these or for the sustainability of a zero term premium? MS. BRAINARD. ask what your view is as to whether consistent with a period when inflation is bouncing around 2 percent vicinity of full employment.  Does that have any implications correlations

The way I and people who do the research in this area have been this is, it just depends on steering between a liquidity trap or zero lower bound other side.  And if we're getting to the target of 2 percent, we're moving away from liquidity trap area, and so you would expect the correlations to not be as positive as we saw into that Scylla and Charybdis or something.  I can't the whirlpool, but that's the liquidity trap.  And so I would expect that move up, and that's actually consistent with the staff MR. GALLIN.  Yes. thinking about problems on one side and high inflation or stagflation on the full employment with inflation bouncing around that when we were really worried about falling remember which one's term premiums on Treasuries would forecast.

Asset valuations are still relatively high.

We can go back and look at to investors since 1987, and all of that's in what the Yale SOM puts out-its stock market confidence indexes. reporting that they think the stock market is going to in a year's time, which was 80 percent a year ago, is now at 63 percent.

First, the relatively excessive borrowing-default rates doesn't suggest building financial When investors have a strong appetite for risk, the financial system usually finds a way to satisfy it.  So what are straightforward case of the household sector:  Some signs of on subprime auto and credit card loans have been rising a little bit, and student loan debt outstanding has continued to grow.  But, overall, the picture

In addition, effectively all of the debt that's being added in the household sector is among borrowers the business sector, I think.  In this recovery-as everyone here initially was a rapid increase in business borrowing that tailed off around 2015, but leveraged.  The ratio of corporate debt to GDP is at the upper end of its in 2008, in the late 1990s, and in the late This leverage has been particularly true that would permit a rapid reacceleration in debt growth among those firms.

Andon the basis of what I hear from those in the market who use and look at vol-targeting funds based on data they can glean, it looks like vol-targeting in fact quantitatively less than it was in January and early February.  So that's the good everything that it less likely to happen. Some excess has been wrung out of greater appreciation of models funds and variations of it are less invested than they were in January, and they have somewhat less leverage on than they did in January.  And, because of that, they believe the potential for selling is news, and we may look back and say February, therefore, was a blessing; happened was healthy, and it makes is an opposing view held by some people whose opinions I respect in the market Quarles said-were washed out, risk parity, vol-targeting shortfall, and other leverage in the financial system are still alive and well out there.

And this investor demand for commercial real estate investments, highIn terms of been noted.  The long, steady economic expansion has increased investor appetite extended period of combination has generated strong yield bonds, and leveraged loans.  Strong investor demand stimulated credit flows to risky borrowers, which has been facilitated by weaker underwriting standards.  These credit flows have pushed values of CRE, leveraged loans, and high-yield bonds to very high levels and increased leverage in the nonfinancial corporate sector.

We need to be thinking about resilience While there is a natural tendency to question the need for thick capital buffers with not having those buffers to absorb losses too evident in a downturn, when it's too late to start building them.

Indeed, some firms noted that worker shortages have become a binding constraint.  Now I know that at our own bank we have numerous openings posted for jobs [Laughter] of lengthening despite the

As Presidents Evans and Mester both said, we are seeing real input cost in multiple places.  Some of it's driven by actual and expected tariff increases-for that steel beam pricing is up 30 percent since 1.  Some of it is oil price driven-for example, in chemicals-and we've heard of in trucker availability with its corresponding pressure on supply A third point: pressure example, steel.  Our contacts in that sector tell us December similar pressures in linerboard, caustic soda, and pulp.  And, of course, notably, we see increase in freight prices and challenges chains.

Despite softness in Q1 consumer spending, the latest data releases real GDP growth that is at or slightly above the trend rate, and a gradual rise in nominal wage growth.  As the market tightens and reports of worker shortages grow, I asked my staff to look at the the labor marketconsistent with broader forces in the economy.  One observation comes from the San meter, in which a significant number of workers report that their the past year.

But our District contacts did point to meaningful price areas and seem quite confident in their ability to pass these higher prices for both domestic and international Importantly, these international included in the U.S. import price indexes, but importers can pass Finally, I expect year-over-year inflation to some upside risk over the medium term as States forecast horizon is difficult to pressures in a couple of on to consumers.

Board staff, am tempted to chalk up most of recent data to payback after a strong Q4.  However, I received few, if any, noticeable acceleration in consumer spending attributable to the tax cuts.  Retailers our anecdotal reports are consistent with the out of the New York Fed indicating that consumer expectations on future spending relatively flat.  On the plus side, the heightened uncertainty that firms appear to be not appear to be significantly affecting household sentiment. On the consumer spending front, I, like the the weakness in the reports of a generally report steady sales growth overall, but survey data growth are feeling does evidence gathered by my regional economic intelligence network suggests labor market conditions have not changed much in recent months.  Like many here, I heard labor markets are tight, but I see few signs of overheating.  My view is that the natural rate in the Tealbook projections, with the reduction being job-search space.  On balance, I still view the being close to or at full employment, but I am not seeing an accumulation of that would suggest the economy is significantly beyond the frontier. Qualitative that that has fallen and is a bit lower than the rate sparked in part by technological change in the economy as evidence

It stands to reason that keep up with the regulatory environment, do little to grow output.

my contacts continue to report little to no pricing shift in sentiment.

These are isolated Reports on likely pricing pressure in the period ahead are mixed-like many have reported here today-with the that are exposed to cost and presumably transitory developments.  Still, it is notable that longer-run business inflation expectations have risen to their highest level since shortly after QE3 began.

The main news is that headline PCE inflation measured from one year earlier is now 2 percent, and moment to celebrate our expecting a very high quality champagne at our event In truth, however-and I'm going to channel Governor Brainard here a little 2 percent target since 2011.  That is six years below target, a time during me, consistently forecast an imminent return of inflation. Regarding the national on inflation core PCE inflation measured from one year earlier is 1.9 percent.  In central banking, this is about the best that can be achieved, so we should probably take a brief victory.  In this respect, Mr. Chairman, I'm tonight.  [Laughter] bit-this event has been a long time coming, as neither headline nor core PCE inflation has been meaningfully above our which the Committee, including

May 1-2, 2018

the United States fell below 5 percent in the fall of 2015the Phillips curve, should presaged increasing inflationary pressure.  That pressure never really materialized, a clear in my mind of just how weak these effects really are in the current macroeconomic these events, it does not seem prudent to me to bet heavily on the idea Phillips curve mechanisms will now become significantly stronger.  Instead, it seems to me baseline case should be for very weak Phillips curve mechanisms in the future.  In terms, an economy growing at 3 percent is not very different from an economy growing effect, in our current environment.  In addition, this has already been preemptive in trying to control those very minor inflationary effects The unemployment rate in more than 2½ years ago-an event that, by conventional accounts of have indication environment.  In light of that that the concise at 2 percent in terms of inflationary Committee by normalizing the policy rate substantially and by allowing the balance sheet to begin to shrink.

If we adjust that expectation down 30 basis points to get something to PCE inflation expectations, we see that markets still do not expect this Committee five years.  This is all the more speaking, have a less aggressive monetary policy the median policy rate path of the Committee. In inflation expectations.  Five-year TIPS-based inflation compensation is now about 2 percent, but that comparable to achieve the inflation target on a PCE basis over the next surprising, as financial markets, generally penciled in compared with would be to let the five-year market-based inflation to 2.3 percent or somewhat higher, and then see how the there and adjust monetary policy in response to macroeconomic surprises I think a prudent policy at this point expectations firm somewhat, perhaps economy evolves from from that point.

In my view, the amount of labor think we're quite uncertain about the trend labor force below the natural rate and that the current labor force rate is also significantly above trend.  Personally, I find the idea that we're the modest nominal wage growth that I continue to pay close market slack is still uncertain:  I participation and about the natural rate of unemployment.  The staff's view at present is that the unemployment rate is 0.6 percentage point participation operating well above full employment hard to square with we're seeing.

There's a huge disconnect. need for a federal job guarantee is resonating with their constituents, it seems like there's a I think there are a lot of Americans who would say nominal wage growth.

At the same this discussion, it occurred to me there are a whole bunch of next cycle who are out If the very big disconnect between labor and the business community, and maybe between our view of maximum employment, or full employment. we're not near maximum employment, as evidenced by the modest for me it welcome.  After so many years below target, this is good news.  To me, the fact that time when core inflation is slowly climbing suggests it is I take that seriously.  Market-based measures have also continued to move up.  Some increased inflation over the past year reflects transitory effects of energy prices and dollar Inflation has continued to move up in recent months, and we're now close to target.

DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'm pretty much with the economic growth side.  Although we've seen a modest slowing in real GDP to have been mainly because of payback for the surge in consumer fall's hurricanes.  The rebound that we the fact that fiscal policy is stimulative and financial markets a pickup in economic activity in the second quarter. VICE CHAIRMAN consensus on the growth in Q1, it looks spending that we saw in the fourth quarter following last saw in consumer spending in March coupled with the ongoing strength of payroll employment reinforces this conclusion.  Also, are still easy points to many people have noted, we're now close to our 2 percent what we're seeing to a is just the opposite of what we saw a year ago.  Just as core PCE inflation was held in cellular phone last March but also the softness in prescription drug prices-it now appears there are pushing upward in the opposite direction. On the inflation side, as objective.

That has percentage point to the increase that we have seen in core PCE inflation. this year compared with 4 percent a year earlier.  That's tenth to the rise in core PCE inflation.  My view is that we shouldn't take rise in hospital and nursing-home rates in And the rise in financial services furnished without payment was due mainly to short-term interest rates relative to deposit rates-a pattern that typically occurs during when deposit rates lag behind changes in the federal funds importantly, both of these increases don't have strong ties back to labor resource Rates of price increase both for hospital and nursing-home services furnished without payment-think about that as deposit services-are rising quite sharply now on a year-over-year basis compared the numbers:  In March 2017, the year-over-year nursing-home services was 1.8 percent.  In March 2018, it had climbed to 3.3 percent.  Now, this is a pretty big component of the PCE.  It's 10 percent of contributed nearly 0.2 Similarly, with respect to financial services furnished without payment, the year-over-year rate climbed to 7.5 percent in March of contributing another too much signal from the recent pickup that we've seen.

And if we had deficits like that, the debt-tothe CBO has updated its rollback of spending-pretty favorable assumptions-the budget deficits are projected to be between 4½ 5½ percent GDP ratio would persistently increase over that period.

First, as I mentioned, the projections assume that current laws maintain.  Well, current law holds down the deficit projections in several ways.  First, in the it's assumed that the provisions of the tax law changes that are scheduled to lapse in that we had all of this lapsing of the tax provisions because that was the into the $1.5 trillion price tag over the 10-year budget Now, there are several reasons why this baseline is likely to be considerably too optimistic. maintaining projections the future do so.  Recall only way to shoehorn these tax cuts window.

CBO projections-and Governor Brainard alluded to this-are based on the and discretionary spending will drop in 2020 as the spending caps themselves.  That doesn't seem very likely to me.  The current CBO projections have discretionary spending falls as well.  And that's all in nominal of these discretionary outlays are assumed to only rise at the inflation of GDP in 2028.

The to above-trend growth in both consumer spending and business Conditions abroad also remain generally favorable, although the apparent slowdown First, many of you are slowing was concentrated in PCE, but fundamentals, including strong job growth, fiscal stimulus, robust household and business confidence, and still-accommodative financial conditions, continue to point investment. of growth in the euro area and Japan will bear watching.

Of course, Above-trend you noted.  Consistent faster, on average, in the first quarter than in 2017.  A rise in accompanied job growth in recent months, keeping the unemployment rate steady.  Strong labor force participation over the past few years has been a welcome surprise, and this strength can reasonably be expected to continue there's no assurance of that.

to 2 percent, consistent with our oft-expressed expectations.  And large number of you mentioned input cost pressures, along with varying through in prices.  And that, too, is a positive that supports increased confidence about the path of inflation, although let's hope too much of a good thing. After the outsized declines of last March dropped from the 12-month calculation, PCE inflation has now moved close I would note that a degrees of ability to pass those increased costs development for not many said, over several years of stubbornly to see inflation return on a sustained basis to our symmetric 2 percent mission is not yet accomplished.  On a personal note, since I joined the month in which 12-month core PCE inflation 2 percent.

We need objective, and that FOMC in May 2012, there has not been a single has reached that streak soon.

I would call out what I thought were particularly interesting, insightful, and thoughtscenarios in the Tealbook.  I think it is going to be hard to beat that set of hysteresis one and the supply constraint one. As always, there are risks to the outlook and some differing views on how best to manage those risks. provoking alternative scenarios-if I can say so-particularly the

Wage gains have continued to move up moderate even after accounting for weak productivity growth, providing of a significant overheating in the labor market so far. In view of the likely decline of unemployment to levels not seen in 50 years, we will need to be alert for signs of mounting inflationary pressures or of emerging financial imbalances. number of you mentioned anecdotes is likely to bring some benefits, for example, by supporting labor force participation or by assuring that gradually but remain little evidence another risk that was prominently mentioned around the table today.  Many of risk of disruptive changes to that, as Beth Anne showed in her measures is actually growing to quite a broad one at the confrontation with China.  If you put it all together, the risks are something that will Trade is you said that you're hearing from your business contacts about the trade policy.  And while we're not yet at the point at which these concerns are affecting the outlook, we'll be watching this closely.  I would point out presentation, the program of protectionist this point, particularly certainly there-and, in my opinion, growing-that this will blossom into have negative implications for the outlook.

number of you mentioned that financial the past materially since the previous meeting.  That, of gradual approach to might move too fast and fail to bring inflation up to 2 percent on a sustained and target rate unchanged at this meeting while door open for a likely hike in June. Turning to monetary policy, I would note that a conditions have tightened modestly, particularly with the dollar strengthening over couple of weeks and the 10-year rate moving up course, is consistent with our normalization policy.  I continue to see our removing accommodation as the appropriate way to balance the risk of overheating against the risk that we symmetric basis.  And that means keeping the leaving the

Most modestly restrictive policy to its longer-run normal rate and returns that we sent you ahead of the December precedent in the postwar record.  If market participants a moderately restrictive policy along these lines, the yield curve could further or even invert.  As shown in the middle-left panel, the yield spread and the 3-month Treasury bill is low by historical spread stands at about the In communicating the Committee's term, of you submitted projections in which a period of ultimately raises the unemployment rate inflation to 2 percent from above.  In a memo 2016 meeting, we noted that such soft landings have not been achieved frequently, although they are not without expected flatten between the 10-year Treasury note standards, but not exceptionally low.  In particular, this 25th percentile of the distribution since 1990 and still about 1½ percentage points above the average historical level associated with the onset of recessions.

The more interpretation of the yield curve flattening is that it reflects concerns that expected to wane and thereby bring forward the end of the The flattening of the yield curve over the past year comes up frequently in our conversations with market participants.  Many saw the recent fiscal stimulus and attendant financing needs of the Treasury as important factors shaping the yield curve.  As mentioned in the middle right panel, they offered two different narratives on how the fiscal developments view, the addition of fiscal stimulus its longer-run level pessimistic the fiscal stimulus will create a fiscal cliff around 2020, when the effects of the current stimulus are expansion.

my prepared remarks.  The March Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  That concludes statement and the draft alternatives are shown on pages 2 to 9 of the handout.  I will be happy to take any questions.

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Vice Chair.

DUDLEY.  Thomas, you said that the yield spread was in the 25th you take the data since 1990.  Is that really a good time frame?  Because you're post-crisis period when we were far away from full it would be better to eliminate this cycle because this cycle is so and take the period before 2007-just to get your thoughts on that. VICE CHAIRMAN percentile if really giving a lot of weight to the employment.  And I wonder if unusual

MR. LAUBACH.  First of all, I don't have the number with me.

DUDLEY.  No, I know you don't.  I just think that it tends to bias VICE CHAIRMAN down that estimate of where you are.

May 1-2, 2018

Looking at the exhibit-to just give another example-the horizontal the onset of recessions.  You see that, in the previous two recessions, a bit higher.  It's very much driven by the early 1980s observations.  Any of sample period, and I'm not claiming that 1990 is time frame to look at.  At the same time, I think it's interesting to ask what are of a potentially persistently lower term premium-the question that came up may come up, we don't necessarily think that it is going to go it was, say, in the 1980s.  So it is difficult to say exactly what the most relevant is. MR. LAUBACH. line is the mean level at that level was quite these statistics are somewhat sensitive to the necessarily the right the implications in Josh's briefing.  Even though it up to where sample

DUDLEY.  By including those 10 years, roughly almost 40 percent this cycle, and because the cycle isn't even over yet and you'd expect the yield toward the end of the cycle, I think you're sort of biasing down your estimate a VICE CHAIRMAN of your sample is curve to be flatter little bit.

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Thanks.  President Rosengren.

on that theme, but from the opposite standpoint. United States have all expanded that in previous periods.  To some it is a policy decision of the central banks around the world to try to depress rates in the the market.  And so when I think about the statistical relationship, we've made a we were very gradual at the long end of the market in letting the balance sheet roll off that would be a flatter a very different stage as well.  How do you think about a MR. ROSENGREN.  So a little bit When I think of a flatter yield curve, Europe, Japan, and the their balance sheets very significantly and haven't done extent, long end of choice that and deciding to focus primarily on the short end.  The consequence of yield curve than we would presumably have seen if we had chosen a different exit strategy and if the Europeans and Japanese were at

May 1-2, 2018

really tied to where the long end of the market is when there's so statistical relationship that is much intervention by central banks around the world?

the ability to in some sense you want to get the expectations for the path of rate, because the signal is when the market participants expect that you MR. LAUBACH.  I would think that if you look at it narrowly, about predict recessions, I would argue the short-term interest need to cut the rate.  On average, they're actually correct about that, right?  And that is what's sending the signal.

still in the period in which the balance sheet here is very large and where balance expansion.  It seems that that would mean that there's sure whether it would have a meaningful effect the slope of the expected path of the policy rate, because that We are sheets elsewhere are even still in potentially less policy space.  But I'm not quite on the signal that you take from arguably should really depend on whether you think the economy is nearing recession, when you need to change the policy rate path.

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Two-hander?  John.

asked my staff this question months ago-Thomas Mertens and, I think, Michael that we published.  To get at this general the term premium into a standard probit model for the probability recession, separately from the slope of the yield curve.  Does the term premium-and it could They also put in entered independently.  Their findings are that the slope of the yield curve recessions, and including the term premium in the did not change that result.  It doesn't prove overwhelmingly that the question about MR. WILLIAMS.  Yes.  I thought President Rosengren's question was an excellent question.  I Bauer worked on this.  It's in an Economic Letter question, they actually threw of be because of QE or other reasons-affect this relationship? r * to see if the level of interest rates is an amazingly robust predictor of relationship

May 1-2, 2018

good one, but the evidence is that at least movements of the term premium separate inverted yield curve don't seem to change this basic idea that the inverted yield curve in the United States. QE is not a from the comes before a recession historically

Kaplan. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  President may read this spreads actually do right before a recession, because which are sometimes as good a predictor as recession as gapping out, because I remember blow-by-blow what happened in 2008, and we were starting to go sideways.  My point-which is not worth to have a drink, which may be more important [laughter]- is, I don't take from the tightness of credit spreads right now, because I think they could change on MR. KAPLAN.  I think I'm okay.  On this bottom right-hand exhibit, I paper just to dig into what credit comes first?  My guess is people start to get nervous, and then credit spreads begin to change.  In a funny way, the tighter the credit spreads spreads that are 2007 in particular, when making, we're about any comfort a dime.  You just need some data, and everything will look different.

Bullard. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  President the discussion of this yield time to have this debate and talk about it.  And I agree with that same kind of analysis.  We came to the same conclusion that the yield a pretty good job of predicting recessions in the United States.  If you go across is that small, open So I think that's why the crossin my mind, right now. MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate curve issue, and I think it is the right President Williams about the San Francisco Economic Letter , which I would recommend.  We did other versions of curve does countries, it's going to break down, and I guess my thinking on that economies are a different kettle of fish than big economies. country evidence doesn't look as good, at least

May 1-2, 2018

that are kind of univariate models. like the yield curve is probably the best one of a lot of literature on it. There are a lot of recession-predictor-type models There are many competing models.  It looks those.  You might be able to combine things.  There's little bit sketchy, and it doesn't always fit into our macro model. say, 'Yield curve?  What?'  But I want to respect and debate this yield curve inversion without saying, 'Okay, we went in with our eyes risk worth taking.' The theory behind it is a So when you talk to macro guys like me, we'll the empirical evidence, and I want the Committee and all of us to think about this and not go blindly into a open.  We knew this could happen, but we think it's a

Committee have done that, but because they felt like they had to fight, they were weighing some risks about getting them.  But for us, we don't have that much of an inflation problem, weight on that than previous committees probably did.  I guess is the bottom line is, slope to the yield curve.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think previous incarnations of this they had an inflation problem inflation under control versus the possibility that you would induce a recession, and it maybe went one way or the other for so I put less I'd like to keep a positive

Kashkari. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  President me, the yield curve flattening is notable.  I mean, we know in a time of a big tax cut, a big increase in roll-off of our balance sheet.  That, to me, is some signal that we should take say, 'Well, this time is different.' MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you.  Very briefly, just one quick comment and then one question.  The comment is, for tightening cycle it's going to fall.  But it's flattening in a spending, and a seriously and not just

a second, on your chart on the top right on where is where is the lower bound problem?  Now, granted, the chart only starts in the effective real federal But then, Thomas, shifting gears for neutral, my question is 2015.  Maybe you'd have to go back further.  But this suggests that

May 1-2, 2018

below neutral.  So I'm trying to understand what this is funds rate that we achieved was well telling me.

all the methods that I'm familiar with, a longer-run the neutral federal funds rate never went as far into negative territory.  The shorterDSGE models that are much more volatile.  But, for example, the MR. LAUBACH.  That's right.  By measure of run measure is obtained using Laubach-Williams measure, of course, always thought that there was, in fact, a negative real rate gap throughout the post-crisis period.

mean that there is no zero lower bound problem?  Well, the  * estimate-at in our model-is of course boosted by asset purchases.  So it's not like you tool.  You did need to have other tools in order to, in effect, such that you were still able to provide the accommodation that the economy view this as 'There is no zero lower bound problem.'  Obviously, you challenging tools. Does that r least, for example, didn't need to resort to any other boost r * to a level needed.  So I would not need to resort to quite right comparison the historical real federal funds rate, in black against your blue dashed line, or should it be against a short-run funds rate to a long-run neutral rate?  And that apples and oranges? MR. KASHKARI.  But is the which you have here neutral rate?  Are you comparing a short-run federal isn't

No.  First, you shouldn't identify the blue dashed line with the of the eight measures represented here.  Any of these measures will tell you that this is measuring the amount currently imparting that, over time, is going to boost the output gap.  If MR. LAUBACH. Laubach-Williams measure.  The blue dashed line is, of course, the mean that are of stimulus that you are you resorted to a more short-run measure of r *, that would be telling you more an answer not to

May 1-2, 2018

economy over time but what would you need to do in order to basically how you stabilize the eliminate the output gap at a much higher frequency.

Looking at 2015 on this chart-and President Kashkari mentioned this to unless you think about the equilibrium real funds rate, there is a of inflation.  So I think the shorter-run measure is the one that tells you that you didn't have accommodation.  And, presumably, the equilibrium funds rate in real terms was MR. EVANS. me-your eye tells  that, shocking amount of accommodation that was being supplied in 2015, and yet we didn't have a lot as much probably negative, and this was accommodative, but not nearly as much.

pointing us in this chart to 2019 and 2020, and now all of a sudden the real is going above  *.  And I think we're supposed to infer that there is some tightness involved mixing these concepts, in a way-it's in the eye of the beholder as to what of this, and we're one of the beholders.  Just a different eye. Now, you're rate r there.  We're kind of you're trying to get out

It was an attempt to construct the chart artfully.  The historical that means that it's not clear where, for example, quickly you are moving from The eye to see that there isn't a whole lot of upward movement going on.  And if that was true, if say that by late 2019, it that you are at the midpoint of these estimates.  But, again, there is no guarantee that these MR. LAUBACH. estimates end where they end, and, of course, these measures are going to move over that period.  So how 'accommodative' to 'neutral' depends in part on what r * is going to do in the future. seems you more or less extended one of these lines straight out, then you might seems estimates are just going to go sideways.  We don't know that.

about gradual increases intended of tight.  So that's why I would focus it the way I did.  But it's a subjective assessment, I think. MR. EVANS.  But the context of the entire discussion is to remove accommodation and where we're sort that

May 1-2, 2018

at these statistical estimates is to MR. LAUBACH.  I completely agree.  I think that looking helpful.  This is basically what the data tell you as of now, and, of course, it's very difficult make predictions.

range of the line says?  Does that include confidence intervals? MR. BARKIN.  Thomas, just a question.  The blue range here, is that the estimates, which is what estimates. MR. LAUBACH.  No.  It's purely the range of

blend of estimates, and then, of course, each estimate has a interval. MR. BARKIN.  That's the confidence footnote points you back to material in the previous individual MR. LAUBACH.  That's right.  The round's Tealbook in which we also show the confidence intervals around the estimates.

Absolutely. MR. LAUBACH.

MR. BARKIN.  I just wanted to make sure I understood.

like to call it, I have not that much 'confidence interval'. keep you for one minute mentioned to some of you, I am looking for some ways to tinker at the margins with the and I want to say right up front that I don't think that our it very well.  I don't think that we produce MR. BARKIN.  Or, as I CHAIRMAN POWELL.  All right.  Thank you.  If I can just before we go down to the West Court Café.  I have something I would like to mention, and I think it would go particularly well with that drink that President Kaplan mentioned.  And that is, as I've format of the FOMC meetings, meetings fail to serve their purpose.  I think they serve bad results or that we fail to allow diverse views or anything like that.

more to make changes to the format so that they become maybe, at the formal, less scripted, more interactive-particularly between participants-less The overall idea is margin, less

issues of the day.  I think back to various examples over the out, and I would point to the previous meeting at which the relationship between SEP forecasts and the that at the margin.  That's repetitive, and more focused on the years in which a conversation breaks President Rosengren brought up the question of staff forecast, and we had a nice go-round exchange.  The idea would be to try to set conditions or have things on the agenda that would somehow provoke more of the idea.

to talk about individual ideas right now, but I welcome a consultative process.  Please call.  Please write.  I hope we sort of a process for collecting ideas work on it together as go forward.  And with that, we go to the West Court Café.  Thanks, everyone. I just want to say-I don't want ideas.  It's going to be, of course, can find some changes, and we'll obviously develop some and talking, but I just wanted to get people thinking about that, and we'll we

MR. QUARLES.  We're trapped!

POWELL.  -there may be delays of 15 minutes at the most.  They're not will be between 11:00 and risk. CHAIRMAN going to shut the place down for two hours, but just know that if you're planning to catch, for example, an 11:30 flight, don't try to leave at 11:00.  [Laughter]  This 1:00.  So that's just a monetary policy go-round with President With that said, let's resume now and begin our Rosengren.

alternative B as written.  While taking any action today, consistent with limited changes in the statement, the market in June, and I think that is quite appropriate. MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chair.  I support we are not seems well aligned with an increase markets are unduly optimistic about the future path of for this year and an unemployment what is viewed as sustainable by this Committee, it is becoming more difficult to the funds rate up more steadily than is implied by the median of The median funds rate path in the SEP implies a pause in our tightening at some point I think the macro environment is more consistent with at least three more this year, not two.  The concern is that a slower pace of normalization now risks in the future once pressure due to a tightening labor market growth and price inflation or, alternatively, financial instability. I am concerned, however, that the rates.  With the Tealbook forecasting inflation at our target rate below explain why we would not move the SEP. during this year, but tightenings being forced into a steeper path shows through to nominal wage

Such disruptions have the potential to lead Such an acceleration in the pace of policy tightening, especially if prepared adequately for introduce heightened volatility into to an episode of financial instability.

we are sticking to a framework that maintains a and a so-called balanced approach, and all of my remarks to this point that was by no means certain a couple of years ago.  It would consider strategies that might move inflation more a broader discussion of the framework. That logic, of course, presumes that 2 percent inflation target have held to that assumption.  In previous years, our challenge was to attain our 2 percent inflation goal, an accomplishment have been premature at that point to persistently above 2 percent.  But now that we are finally achieving a 2 percent inflation, we should be planning for to allow the actual and target inflation rates would be much less concerned with the pace of tightening currently current framework, undue patience now is likely to imbalances.  One way or another, whether through an episode by requiring a more aggressive and thus risky policy response, such are not likely to end well.  They never have historically.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If we were, perhaps opportunistically, willing to rise above 2 percent, I envisioned in the SEP.  However, under the build significant macroeconomic of financial instability or imbalances

If the economy continues to perform as meeting and there's no material deterioration in the favor an increase in the funds rate in June. the Committee to act today and the Committee's another expected between now and our June medium-run outlook, I will a June increase, so of comments, though.  In paragraph 1, I have a slight for the simplified language on inflation expectations that appears in paragraph 1 of In paragraph 2, I appreciate the change that eliminates the phrase saying that danger of suggesting less month-to-month variation in inflation numbers is typical of that we recently experienced.  Also in paragraph 2, I appreciate indicating that to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced' and removing the reference to the 'monitoring inflation developments closely.'  But with the removal in paragraph 2, I we remove the language from paragraph 4. The wording of alternative B does not seem to change expectations of I'm supportive of it.  I have a couple preference alternative C. inflation will stabilize around our inflation goal.  As I indicated in our previous meeting, the word 'stabilize' ran the than the 'risks Committee would also suggest that

it would be useful for the Committee to reconsider the statement part of its ongoing work to improve its communication.  In the meantime, to raise the funds rate in June, it would be an opportune time to 'clean up' the language we've been carrying in the course of several statements.  And we've been Now, at some point, more fundamentally as should we decide some of asked to comment on alternative C as one way to do that.

about the current format of paragraphs 1 and 2 covering the economy and paragraphs 3 and 4 the paragraphs. In considering those changes, I took a step back and thought the statement.  Now, I realize not everyone may view the statement the way I do, but I view it as having four paragraphs, with covering monetary policy.  Within each topic, there's a time element to

May 1-2, 2018

on appropriate monetary policy.  Paragraph 3 discusses gives a Committee's reaction function.  It conveys an important idea that policy is being set something that can enhance Committee credibility by making decisions to understand and anticipate.  'Systematic policymaking' is something that to continue to convey through word and deed. Paragraph 1 discusses recent economic developments.  Paragraph 2 discusses the outlook and risks around the outlook, conditional current monetary policy.  And paragraph 4 discusses future policy considerations and sense of the in a systematic way, easier for the public the Committee needs a guide, I would change the conditioning statement in paragraph 2 to merely rate path is-that is, further gradual forward guidance or Committee is approaching its future policy reaction function-will vary with economic In current circumstances, I believe it's appropriate to continue to indicate the anticipates further increases in the funds rate, because this will help align the public's expected policy rate path. With that as say 'conditional on appropriate policy, the Committee's outlook is X Y , , and Z .'  I would put the Committee's view of what that appropriate policy increases-into paragraph 4.  Whether paragraph 4 gives more explicit whether it gives only information about how the decisions-that is, information about the circumstances. Committee expectations with this

previous meeting, I do agree it's time to delete the language that at this meeting. As I indicated in the says the Committee expects the funds rate to remain below its longer-run level for some time. This is problematic language in view of the path shown in the SEP, and I'd even be comfortable removing that language the tension Finally, with respect to how we discuss our monetary policy goals in paragraph 4, those who were around when the longer-run goals and strategy document was negotiated in 2011 and 2012 and first adopted by the Committee in 2012 may remember the discussions of

mandate-namely, why the Committee should set a numerical goal but not for the maximum-employment part of the mandate.  The proposed language that tension by using 'objective' for maximum for inflation.  I don't feel calling attention to that distinction is helpful.  I paragraph 2 when speaking about 2 percent inflation, so I don't see why we between the two parts of our for inflation in paragraph 4 in alternative C calls attention to employment and 'goal' prefer we keep the alternative B language that refers to both as objectives.  After all, we use the term 'objective' in wouldn't do the same in paragraph 4.  Thank you, Mr. Chair.

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Thank you.  Governor Quarles.

alternative B as gradual tightening is most both objectives of our dual mandate.  Inflation is effectively at our still-moderate nominal wage growth and not much sign of further pressure on rates is likely needed to keep the sustainable rate. MR. QUARLES.

I'll just make a couple of comments on alternative C. on not changing the first two sentences in paragraph 4.  I the changes that she proposed here in staying with the previous language.  And, as you've would retain the sentence evolve in a manner that will warrant risk of being redundant, to make clear to the market and to observers In terms of the statement language, I would agree with President Mester like heard me mention before, on the deleted language at the bottom, I about 'the Committee expects that economic conditions will further gradual increases.'  I know it's redundant to some extent with paragraph 2, but I think it would be useful, at the what the Fed's thinking is on our reaction function.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Thank you.  President Barkin.

path. MR. BARKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chair.  I'm comfortable supporting alternative B today. The data over the past several months have been, by and large, consistent with the path we've articulated, and I see no reason to vary from that alternative B are, I think, ready to be revisited.  At the end of paragraph 'market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low.'  I'm the history of this language and its intent when it was introduced-to underscore our then.  And we retained this language they are now to support to inflation.  But today, as I look at the language with Two sentences in 1, we continue to state that aware of concern with the soft inflation readings we were seeing early last year when inflation compensation numbers got close to where the view there were still downside risks

that we're experiencing a more sustained return of inflation appears to me to be less useful and potentially misleading, as it appears fresh eyes-and with my expectation to target-the language to call out downside risks to inflation when, in the next paragraph, we characterize risks as balanced.

ripe for removal is the end of paragraph 4, the funds rate is 'likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are in the longer run.  As I said at our previous meeting, when it gets removed A and alternative C for conflicting reasons, one might want to consider whether could actually be confusing. The other element of the statement that is statement that the federal expected to prevail from alternative including it to misinterpretation, so I think it makes in a press I note that the staff is unsurprisingly ahead of me on both changes.  Alternative C These two changes are both substantive and open sense to execute them in June when the Chair has an opportunity to discuss them conference. incorporates both of these and, I think, does so quite well.

a request for our next meeting-I would love to ask the staff to run, perhaps as rate increases, the March SEP median.  I think that forecast would make us take on in a more of the strength of the economy and ours.  And think that would be a valuable challenge to my thinking before we take on Finally, an alternative scenario, the Tealbook forecast with a more moderate path of maybe similar to direct way the gap between the Tealbook sense speaking for myself, I our next rate decision.

Evans. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Thank you.  President our 2 percent inflation target.  However, low inflation expectations remain a concern, so I MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B today.  Now that we have better confirmation in the data, I'm more confident that we are headed toward symmetric

tightening gradual to help bolster expectations.  The data will this means two or three additional rate hikes this year.  I guess that means thinking on the is, the non-accelerationist Phillips curve-there's no reason need to push rates beyond what markets expect.  Once inflation expectations inflation at our target. think we need to keep the pace of determine whether data dependence.  Markets seem comfortable with this range of funds rate outcomes and our data-dependent approach.  And, as I discussed last time, given our current best nature of the inflation process-that to think we measures are stable around 2 percent, simply bringing policy rates to neutral or perhaps a little above should be enough to stabilize of my time discussing the suitability of alternative C for our My bottom line is that I think it will serve us well for the near term, but challenges that we will need to address, perhaps in First, I'm glad the alternative continues to describe our expected funds increases in the target range.  As I just noted, I think gradualism is necessary into better alignment with our symmetric 2 percent objective. that, though the is in data-dependent mode, we are unlikely to shift gears abruptly.  This should help market's policy expectations from overreacting to the ups and downs we inevitably will the coming data. I'd like to spend the rest future policy statement. there will be some further communications the not-too-distant future. rate path as gradual to bring inflation expectations Continuing to communicate a gradual pace also conveys to the public Committee keep the see in

language in paragraph 2 is artful in saying that future 'increases . . . will be activity and employment.' 'Sustained' is the parse here.  Presumably, sustainable growth means growth that could be repeated For activity, that means 1¾ to 2 percent, our views for long-run growth in the estimates-say, 60,000 to 120,000 per month. Second, the consistent with sustained expansion of economic key term to year after year. SEP.  For employment, there's a wide range of

interpretation of 'sustained,' alternative C associates our tightening path with GDP Under this and employment growth moderating to such lower numbers.

we will be above potential and unemployment below its natural rate, at some point the real GDP growth falling below trend and the unemployment rate rising modestly landing.  Currently, this slowdown lies beyond the alternative C I just think that our attempts to speak plainly will become more difficult as horizon moves forward.  And if inflation pressures remain contained, then describing may be even more This is largely in line with the projections for 2020 in the March SEP.  However, as think output SEPs will show as we attempt to engineer the quintessential soft our 2020 forecast horizon.  But I can imagine these lower projections emerging in September when we roll the SEP forward to forecast 2021.  I can't really improve on offering at this time. the forecast the rationale for below-trend output growth and rising unemployment challenging.

alternative C that 'monetary policy remains may also have a short shelf life.  Within a year of gradual increases, the funds could be in the range of 2½ to 2¾ percent-and I agree with the comments that President going to be more challengingthe long-run neutral rate.  And if the short-run rate continues to be below the longer-term rate, then we'll be at neutral wonder where we see the current funds rate short-run The statement in paragraph 3 of accommodative' rate Kaplan made about how, once we get to this juncture, I think it's thus reaching the SEP central tendency for equilibrium federal funds even sooner.

it could soon be helpful to include a modifier in front of 'accommodative'the public know that we are reasonably close to a natural resting point for policy, or it I think something like 'monetary policy remains modestly accommodative.'  This would have the virtue of letting

May 1-2, 2018

to being accommodative altogether.  Of course, the hard part is figuring out where turning to current growth and inflation developments as uncomfortable but inevitable 'we'll know it when we see it' mode for could be the first step in preparing them if we eventually need to move beyond neutral to a restrictive stance.  Naturally, when we think we are roughly at neutral, we should remove the reference neutral is.  We'll probably find ourselves a guide-the somewhat calibrating policy.

and our symmetric 2 percent inflation goal in alternative C, and that being mentioned.  I think that I don't have a strong opinion about 'objective' think it's extremely useful that we insert the term 'symmetric 2 percent to get 'symmetric' in there, we end up with this and 'goal.'  I don't have a strong opinion on or preference for that, except for the You know, I had not really taken great note of paragraph 4 language about our maximum-employment objective I appreciate versus 'goal,' but I do inflation goal.'  And it could be that by trying 'objective' fact that I think 'symmetric' is quite useful.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So, in sum, if it's appropriate to increase the language in alternative C.  But we should think ahead a bit appropriate engineering a soft

President support alternative B at this meeting, as remains accommodative, and, as I alluded to yesterday, I'm more confident to or above our target and that economic growth will be sustained.  With evidence of strengthening in inflation, I'm becoming more confident that a policy that funds rate four times this year may be appropriate, depending on how the data evolve. MR. HARKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chair.  I amended.  Policy that inflation will rise firmer raises the

May 1-2, 2018

concur with President Evans that the addition of that word is That does not imply that we should be overly concerned with inflation rates rising modestly above 2 percent.  The target is symmetric, and we should miss on the upside as often as we miss on the downside.  And I appropriate.

also a good deal of uncertainty regarding the natural rate of interest, and that the level of the neutral funds rate.  We may be only 100 basis so from neutral.  If that's the case, it implies that we should proceed cautiously and removal of accommodation.  I anticipate that output will grow at about its percent, which leads me to conclude that any for the economy. There's implies significant uncertainty over points or gradually with the trend rate and inflation will only slightly exceed 2 significant overshooting of our policy rate would be problematic occur, a further increase in entire economic climate.  Therefore, I think we should remain accommodation at anything but a gradual pace. Uncertainty also appears to be abnormally high, and the increased uncertainty is being reflected, for example, in greater asset market volatility.  Many of my contacts are concerned with the possibility of a trade war.  And even if one does not uncertainty could damp the prudent and not remove

May 1-2, 2018

June meeting, however, I do support further adjustments in also support a recalibration of the meeting to more clearly express the Committee's expectations. normalization.  Looking ahead to the the stance of policy, assuming no change in the outlook.  I statement at the June

I consider the risks to the outlook roughly balanced in the near term, I see uncertainties over the medium term.  In particular, with unemployment below most its longer-term level, with real GDP expected to grow faster than the potential rate, see a nonnegligible risk that inflation could rise inversion, and uncertainty about trade policy all over the medium term.  In this context, I would prefer we deemphasize uncertainty and data with our policy rate path.  In particular, I support dropping the guidance that says in the longer run' as proposed in alternative C. While considerable estimates of and with inflation headed higher, I uncomfortably above our target.  On the other hand, rising longer-term interest rates, declining equity values, the possibility of a yield curve present downside risks forward guidance in our communication and associate a sense of greater dependence 'the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail

I think we need to reevaluate whether we still want to describe our interest While my baseline outlook does not call for speeding up on to normalization, I'm concerned that our current forward guidance has a familiar ring to false sense of stability, a buildup of financial imbalances that is also possible that the downside risks I mentioned earlier could in which case we might want to slow the pace of normalization.  The point is that the In addition, rate normalization path as gradual. the path that of 2003.  We said we would keep rates low because inflation was low and financial imbalances were thought to be benign.  In my view, this guidance gave a which in turn led to greater risk-taking and facilitated ended poorly.  Of course, it materialize,

in the statement in June. uncertainty around the medium-term outlook makes it difficult to provide forward guidance, and I would prefer we deemphasize it the discussion yesterday about the effective federal funds rate to IOER, I support resuming work about the long-run operating framework.

Bullard. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Thank you.  President react to what other people have been saying around the table.  I'm going to start off the Dallas Fed trimmed mean rate as a measure of underlying for use by the Committee.  This is a topic that I've tried to hit on in the past.  I think it is Dallas Fed trimmed mean as our main underlying inflation.  Several of you pointed out yesterday that the Dallas Fed mean was 1.8 percent a year ago and is 1.8 percent today.  So that would indicate not underlying inflation. MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'm going to give some comments here that try to with core PCE inflation versus inflation time to consider our putting more emphasis on the measure of trimmed too much in the way of developments in terms of

mean tracks core PCE inflation quite closely except the Committee.  One was in 2015, and the other was in and moved core PCE 'Well, core inflation is it's not really lower because there are special factors, and therefore we're going to if you look at the Dallas Fed trimmed mean in both of Since 2011, the Dallas Fed trimmed for two incidents, which I think hurt 2017.  In both of those cases, there were special factors that came in inflation lower.  And then in both cases, we spent an entire year saying, lower, but wait until the special factors roll out.'  But

May 1-2, 2018

flat,' and that's what we were trying to say anyway. those cases, it did not drop, and you would not have had to tell those stories.  You would have been able to say, 'Well, inflation is pretty is that the Dallas Fed trimmed mean was about 1.6 percent think that gives you a better sense of what's up toward 2 percent.  I think that's a better assessment of what's middle of last year-now it's up at 1.9 percent.  There must be increasing inflation I think that's a deceptive signal, and that's coming from artificial core PCE inflation that aren't in the Dallas Fed trimmed mean.  So it's feeding into an inflation story that I'm not sure is really there. Another element of this during 2015.  It's now about 1.8 percent.  I happened over the past several years.  In terms of inflation, there was almost no movement but very gradual movement happening.  Now we've got core PCE, and markets are saying, 'Well, core PCE was 1.3 percent in the pressure in the economy.' factors in accelerating

I'm not We have a better measure.  Let's use it.  I think the fact that we use core PCE own perceptions of what's going on with underlying inflation, and it Dallas Fed trimmed mean.  It has and I'd encourage everyone to go more in that I think it's a better measure. Why do we have to do this?  Why do we have to stick with core PCE inflation? quite sure. inflation is harming our harms our communications.  I know a lot of you have cited the been a trend over the past five years or more, direction.

turn to some ideas about the statement.  I do support alternative B for today and, the future.  [Laughter]  I think we may want to think about alternative A for next time, so let me try to make the case for alternative A. Let me actually, for quite a while into something like yesterday, inflation expectations are still too low for comfort for true that something like the five-year TIPS-based measure of expected In my opinion, as I said this Committee.  It's inflation-or compensation, really, but let's call that expected inflation-is about 2 percent, but

May 1-2, 2018

based on market put in risk premiums or anything five years.  The market is saying, 'I don't really think you're going to hit your inflation the next five years.' then you have to convert that into an expectation for PCE inflation that's factors.  If you make that conversion-and even if you don't like that-you're going to get a number like 1¾ percent for market-based expected inflation over the next target over is close enough for government work.'  But, you know, for a long time, since early 2012.  And the other thing about the marketfactoring in an economy that's doing factoring in a strong labor market.  They're factoring in fiscal policy. in oil prices.  So it's a sufficient statistic, and the kicker is that markets are a more 'dovish' Committee than what this Committee is saying that we're going to rate increase path.  And even doing that, we're not going to hit our inflation Now, you might say, 'Well, this we have missed this based measures is, they're factoring everything in.  They're very well.  They're They're also factoring factoring in do on our baseline path.  They're anticipating that we're going to have to back off somewhat from our interest target.  That's how I would interpret the market signal at this point.

little bit of emphasis on this, if you dig far enough in the Tealbook and look models we use to get an estimate of the probability of inflation exceeding 3 percent versus than 1 percent, according to the models we use, we've still a higher probability that inflation would be lower than 1 percent in the future rather than 3 percent in the future.  Those are tail events, but I think that's interesting that, the probabilities really haven't shifted as much as the rhetoric has Just to put a at the the probability of inflation being less got higher than according to those models, shifted around the table here.

good strategy for the Committee would to use the fact that the economy is performing well-it doesn't really get any better than this Inflation expectations are too low, and I think a be

May 1-2, 2018

banker's perspective-and try to get inflation expectations back to a reasonable I think 2¼ or 2.3 percent on the five-year TIPS and maybe 2½ percent or higher on the So I think that you'd like them to run somewhat than they are today, and that that would be a beautiful thing to do, because that would set target over the next five years, as opposed to again struggling on over that period. from a central level: five-year, five-year-forward, because those are CPI-based measures, and they have risk premiums and so on-other things in there. higher us up for hitting our 2 percent the low side

Tealbook policy.  I do think, as I've said before at this meeting, that the have outlived its usefulness as a baseline policy measure, and maybe we is a difficult thing from staff's perspective-what do you want to present to the Committee?-but I think it's gotten markets are on this. Okay.  A third topic I just wanted to touch on is to think about an alternative approach to the baseline Taylor (1999) rule may should think about a different way to do this.  I do understand that this the quite a ways out of alignment with what the Committee is thinking and with what thinking.  That's okay.  But I think we want to revisit this issue and think about what we're doing.  I agree with President Barkin's comment just put out a possible question for consideration.  We could ask the question 'What changes to the would be necessary to rationalize the median SEP path of the policy rate?'  And I would happen is, you'd say, 'Well, this elasticity would have to be different.  I'd coefficient.'  Then you could come back and say, 'How reasonable are these crazy or something.  And that would be a Let me differently than we do.  Instead of assuming Taylor (1999), we could say, staff model think what have to change that modifications?  Why don't we want to make these modifications?'  There are good reasons: They don't fit the data, they're unreasonable, or they're

May 1-2, 2018

could then debate the median SEP path versus what the staff model says.  How would those changes be?  So that's just one idea about maybe how to proceed here. way that we reasonable few reactions to some of the things said this morning.  President Rosengren much patience might create a situation in which we have to raise the policy rate event might cause market volatility-it might cause a problem, recession.  That's a common argument made around this table.  I do not agree with to be too patient today because we a mistake later.  And I think that's not the way to think about it.  The way to think at exactly the right policy today and exactly the right policy later, in exactly the right way so there wouldn't be this jarring recession.  I think if it's appropriate to be patient today, reset inflation expectations.  And we have to have confidence in to adjust and go from there. I have just a said too aggressively later, and then that might cause a that argument.  You know, that's saying that we don't want might make about it is, we're going to be and we're going to prepare markets surprise in the future that would cause a we should be.  We could ourselves that if the data tell us to adjust, then we're going

says, not much is really going on, as far as the flattening of the yield curve-that's very common as fine where it we going to be at the end of this year or early 2019?  And if invert, what kind of signal is that sending?  I think it is sending some kind of signal, and it the long-term interest rate is supposed to be the of future expected short-term rates.  So markets are saying that future short-term rates to be lower.  That sounds like at least a growth slowdown or maybe recession.  So to work pretty well in the U.S. data historically. Governor Quarles asked a great question on the yield curve issue.  He correctly that an expansion goes along, and I totally agree with that, and I think the yield curve is is today.  The question is, where are it does does have some theoretical support because sequence will have that's why it seems

May 1-2, 2018

a big advocate press conferences.  I agree with his assessment that they're going to be more like to get on with it if we can.  I think the ability for the on a regular basis, even if not too much is going on, is very reassuring to we're not changing our plans more than what the data situation soon so that we can handle President Kaplan commented on press conferences.  Of course, I've been of going to regular important as we go forward, and I'd Chair to communicate markets so that they understand that suggest.  I would very much think that we want to get to that the variability in the data more effectively.

that translate market-based expectations into the PCE version. President Barkin also called current inflation expectations acceptable.  I think they're too low, according to my calculations we're getting increased entrenchment, that to simply raise the policy rate every quarter come hell or high water and we're going what we would do and under what circumstances we would pause. President Evans emphasized ideas about data dependence.  I do think that too mechanical here.  I think markets are starting to think, with we're going to look through all variation in the data and not change.  I think we should at least have a contingency plan about

C getting questionable.  I think we need a modifier there.  I would suggest 'somewhat think President Evans suggested something else.  I think we have to do to modify that particular term in alternative C. I also agree with President Evans about the 'remains accommodative' phrase in alternative accommodative.'  I something the time, Mr. Chair. Okay.  I'll quit rambling on, and I appreciate

Kashkari. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Thank you.  President continue to inflation, inflation expectations, and indicators of labor inflation moving up.  I think the fact that it's MR. KASHKARI.

I've been calling for accommodative I feel more comfortable moving to a neutral stance in the near term, but the big is neutral?  And I don't see any evidence, in the data we've talked about we should be going to a contractionary policy stance.  I think the neutral stance makes But 'where is neutral?' is a very big question mark, at least in my mind. My policy views have changed in the sense that monetary policy. question is, where today, that more sense.

Tealbook-not this one, the March ranges, and the ranges for the short run and in the long run.  In a sense, I think about a confusing.  But if I think about where the 10-year rate is The rate might be at its neutral value already.  I don't know.  But my staff and I are going to more work trying to assess where neutral is. There are lots of different models.  The previous one-went through an update of different r * are all over the place. Returning to the discussion, Thomas, we had yesterday, when I think about it, I think about a short-term  * and a long-term  * in r r 'yield curve*'-which gets kind of today, at 3 percent, minus 2 percent inflation, you have a real interest rate of 1 percent. 10-year do a lot the yield curve, it's not simply the inversion as a recession look at the yield curve as giving us feedback on where neutral is.  If we proceed short-term rates this year and if the 10-year rate were to stay would be telling us, 'Hey, you're pretty close to neutral already.'  So I think we that into account. Then when I think about indicator.  I down a path of continuing to raise at around 3 percent, yes, we would be approaching a flat or an inverted yield curve.  But I think the market should take that seriously and take

May 1-2, 2018

there's language that we expect to overshoot our inflation target.  I actually like language because I think most people around the table do expect us to overshoot the we're expecting it and we're comfortable with it would be think that we're going to overreact.  So I would encourage us to the language in alternative A rather than what's in alternative C in June.  Second, I baking in too many rate hikes this year, because if the yield curve does would encourage us to pause.  We don't want to to a steep rate path that we may then have to back off from.  I'd ask us to consider is, I always struggle with this notion that we're raising rates to sustain intellectually taxes to balance the budget.  We seem to be is simply to say, 'We in order to achieve our dual-mandate goals over the unemployment rate.  If we're trying to achieve our dual-mandate goals, we're trying to and we're trying to achieve stable prices-without having to go intellectual contortion of raising rates to sustain the expansion.  Thank you, Mr. When I look at alternative C, I have three quick comments.  One comment is, in alternative A, that inflation target.  And signaling that helpful so markets don't consider would caution us about flatten, I think a number of us around the table overcommit that.  Then the last point the expansion.  I know what we're trying to say, but I find this language contorted-like arguing that we need to cut contorting ourselves to make this argument.  I think a stronger argument think we need to raise the federal funds rate medium term.'  And that gets us away from people getting concerned that we're trying to raise the achieve maximum employment, to this Chairman.

Thank you.  The current economic outlook remains consistent with continued gradual increases in the federal reasons.  First, I expect

Although the tax cuts are already in years. delay, which will stretch out the effect of the agreed appropriations.  And, as we discussed yesterday, there's beyond the two-year window.  Similarly, the process of recovery abroad in some advanced foreign economies is warranted in light of the long period of undershooting inflation target.  As many have said, it's encouraging that the latest inflation readings are long period of underperformance near the lower bound and we had seen in various measures of expected inflation, it's reasonable to conclude want to see I also believe the gradual pace our very close to our objective, but on the conventional over-the-year measure, that's been true for only one month.  Moreover, given a the slippage that longer-run underlying inflation is running somewhat below our target.  We will inflation remaining in a narrow band around the 2 percent objective on a sustained basis to ensure underlying inflation is re-anchored at 2 percent.

While the Unfortunately, there's little precision in our understanding of the lags process.  A resource utilization, and that, of course, underlies the case for later outbreak of inflation.

I will say that I think this the yield curve is more about, do you have a high fever, or do you have a severe In either case, you want to go to the doctor.

I repeat, I think, what most everyone the strong economic baseline described in our March as we stretch well strong economic outlook, I'm increasingly Anyway, going back to supporting alternative B, said.  Recent data have been in line with forecasts.  Job gains are averaging well above their sustainable pace even beyond full employment.  On the inflation side, the latest data show inflation essentially at 2 percent.  And with all indicators pointing to a confident that this will be a sustained achievement of our target.

to the views expressed by a number of people, though, that this is the time to declare 'mission accomplished' on inflation.  We have had just one month at the inflation, so I think we have to be cautious here.  I'm confident ourselves about declaring victory. I'm very sympathetic not 12-month change in terms of core that we're going to have a sustained 2 percent inflation-a little bit of an overshoot-but, at the same time, I don't think we should get ahead of the background of these conditions, it is appropriate to maintain a steady but The language in alternative B allows us to hold rates fixed for an increase in the target range in June, barring any surprises before that meeting.  And I continue to see a total of four rate increases appropriate, in view of the very favorable outlook for the economy and inflation.

In particular, it runs counter to the projected neutral rate in the median SEP.  Similarly, the language on closely when we were undershooting our may be confusing when we're at the target or actually in the period when we're As we look ahead to the good template for updating the statement Some of the For example, as I've language in paragraph 4 that suggests the federal funds rate is likely to remain below long-run levels for some time is getting past overshooting of the monitoring inflation and inflation expectations served us well target but modestly overshooting the 2 percent target.

It rate increase path may not the neutral rate is low, and that if the economy not want to continue with increases four times a year or some kind of that.  So I do think we want to have more optionality on how we describe our policy moves.  And for that reason, I do think that we will want to step away from the forward guidance that we have in paragraph 4 at the appropriate time.  Again, I think C provides a really nice approach to doing that sometime in the future. more as optionality whether you're thinking about it as alternative could be that the economy performs much stronger, and this gradual be appropriate.  It could be that, as I believe, underperforms, we will gradual path like future explicit alternative changes in statement language should occur today for reasons a in paragraph 1, 2, 3, or explanation by the Chairman at the press conference to make sure that we're doing as a shift in our reaction function, but instead as a movement reaction function reflecting the really strong economy and, again, the much better data indicators.

I think it's going to be important in our public communications to that we still remain on toward our inflation objective. indicate that this outcome was what we've actually been anticipating, and a gradual path of removing monetary policy accommodation.

target is symmetric.  Moreover, it is very premature to signal that we've reached our objective, because I think the I talked about this yesterday.  Some of the upward pressure on the core my vantage point, to be due to transitory factors, so it's possible inflation turn back down again. Although inflation has gotten back to near 2 percent, our I think inflation data are noisy; PCE index appears, at least from that we could see core PCE

First, the removal would make it from forward guidance, a step that I think is appropriate.  Second, by removing we expect 'the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below in the longer run,' it should signal that, as the federal funds we judge as neutral, we're becoming more agnostic about what comes Turning to alternative C, I do think it provides a remove the language in paragraph 4 will be clear that monetary policy is not on a preset course.  In my mind, it'd be the final step in 'walking back' the language that levels that are expected to prevail rate gets closer to what next.

C, including the removal of the 'gradual language in paragraph 4, might be taken by some as implying a more aggressive postmeeting June, I expect that this risk will be out there, and we just need to be aware of it.  I mitigated by two things, however.  Number one, the second paragraph will keep the the fact that we'll have the Summary of Now, by themselves, the changes in alternative increases' policy stance.  If we go with alternative C or something close to that as the statement in think it's 'gradual increases' language.  And number two is

the March meeting.  So I think Economic Projections, which I think won't change much from those will anchor and push against that potential risk.

I don't share this concern that the flattening of the yield curve it continues further, which seems likely, a recession in target.  If the curve weren't flattening, this would suggest that we're behind the Finally, I want to return to the issue of the flattening of the Treasury yield curve.  There are several reasons why foreshadows an economic slowdown or, if the next year or two.  First, we should be expecting the curve to flatten when we're raising our federal funds rate curve in removing monetary policy accommodation.

flattening is particularly pronounced.  The current experience when you don't include the past decade. the past decade from your calculation for two was a very deep recession, so that meant there was a long period to get employment.  During that period, the yield curve is going to be very, very steep. think you want to include it because you're including only part of a including the part of the business cycle in which the yield curve is steep, the business cycle in which the yield curve was flat or about what's normal, you should be basically Second, I don't think the yield curve spread between the yields on the 2-year Treasury note and the 10-year Treasury note is really roughly average compared with historical And I really do think that you want to exclude reasons.  Number one, it back to full Number two, I don't business cycle.  You're but you're not including the part of inverted.  So I think if you're doing this analysis looking at complete business cycles.

the yield curve to be flatter than normal because term premiums term premiums is different from flatness due to likely to fall in the future.  So, to me, the shape of the yield curve per se, but whether monetary policy is indeed Third, we should expect are depressed.  And I think flatness due to lower expectations that short-term interest rates are high and are what matters is not

May 1-2, 2018

If short-term rates are high relative to what is likely to occur over the longer term, then the future, and the yield curve will be flat or invert tight. investors will expect short-term rates to fall in to reflect such expectations.

I think is still viewed as accommodative.  If you look at federal funds rate futures a few years out, they climb to about 2.7 percent, and then they're sort of flat after that. that a neutral federal funds rate is 2½ or higher, and not really that different from our implied SEP median long-term federal funds rate of Now, in the current environment, I don't think that's where we are at all. monetary policy contracts That implies market participants believe that's 3 percent.

is market expectations, and the markets don't always get it right.  Even if the were to flatten, I don't think we want to take this onboard literally and say, 'Well, thinks that the curve is inverted.  Therefore, short-term rates are high.'  We have to independent judgment about whether monetary policy is, in fact, tight. Also, this yield curve the market make our being that happens is, when the yield inverted, it's because people think that short-term rates are high relative to what they're in the future, and that's it.  There's no causal aspect to this. Finally, while the inverted yield curve has typically preceded recession, I'm not aware of any causal element in this.  This is all just about expectations.  I'm not aware of banks unwilling to lend because the yield curve inverts.  I think that all curve is going to be

to flatten as we inversion might happen normal because term premiums are depressed.  But worrying now that we're about to mistake because the curve is flattening somewhat seems completely Our tightening moves have not appreciably tightened financial market conditions. So I think what's going to happen is, the yield curve is going to continue remove monetary policy accommodation.  And I would imagine that earlier than commit a major policy misplaced.
