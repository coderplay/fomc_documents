FIRST DISTRICT -BOSTON

Economic expansion remains solid in  New England. Reports from contacts in  retailing, manufacturing, and commercial real estate all have a positive tone. Insurance companies indicate mixed results. Input and  materials prices are generally little changed; some manufacturers are raising prices. A  recent forecast of the New  England economy predicts current trends will continue, with  employment growing more slowly than in  the nation and  unemployment remaining low.

Retail

First District retailers report varied results in  September and the first half of  October. Non-apparel contacts, such as  furniture and  hardware chains, cite steady double-digit sales growth in  the  past six  weeks. By contrast, several off-price discounters and  one shoe chain note soft September sales, ranging from level to  15  percent declines compared with year-earlier levels, followed by  modest gains in  early October. Respondents' expectations for the upcoming holiday season range from 1  to  15 percent sales growth over last year. Retail contacts believe the economy is strong in  most areas of  New England and  that consumers are  more confident and optimistic than a  year ago.

Vendor and  customer prices generally remain flat; one  contact, however, noted a  temporary price hike for European shoe leather. Gross margins and profits vary, and  most inventories are  high in  anticipation of  the holiday season. Several contacts plan new  store openings in  1997 and  expect small gains in employment as a  result. Wage increases of 2  to  5 percent are anticipated.

Manufacturing

A  slight majority of the First District manufacturers contacted indicate that sales are little changed from a year ago. Some of these firms, however, report improved profits through cost reductions. The remaining contacts indicate solid sales gains from a year ago. Manufacturers generally say  that they are successfully managing their inventories.

A  couple of  contacts note medical supply markets as  a  source of rapid growth. A  textile manufacturer detects a  small improvement in  apparel retailing, after several slow years. Several respondents mention adverse effects of  foreign imports. For  example, a  maker of  high-quality furniture notes that while his own  business is  thriving, the U.S. furniture parts industry is shrinking because of  competition, especially from China. Automotive suppliers indicate a  need to  develop other products because carmakers increasingly are turning to  low-cost offshore suppliers. Exporters tend to  be  experiencing slow business in  Europe, but rapid growth in  Asian markets.

Most manufacturers report that overall materials prices are similar to or  lower than a  year ago. Chemicals prices are rising, but contacts indicate that the increases are selective or  smaller than a  year earlier. About onehalf of  the contacts report that their selling prices remain unchanged. However, a maker of consumer durables recently raised prices by  7 percent, and several nondurables manufacturers, including firms in  the  paper products industry, report price increases in the 3  to  4 percent range. In  contrast, a machinery manufacturer whose business has recently slowed has instituted a temporary price reduction for  one  product line.

About one-half of  the manufacturing contacts report stable employment over the  past year; most of  the remainder have reduced their head counts. Currently, more respondents are adding than are cutting employment, but contemplated changes generally are  modest. Although a  couple of contacts report wage freezes, most have raised pay  2  to  4 percent this year. Most respondents state that labor availability is  not a problem.

Commercial Real Estate

The  New  England commercial real estate market is  doing well. The economy in  most states has improved, resulting in increased demand. In Massachusetts, Connecticut, and  Rhode Island, vacancy rates have declined and rental rates increased. The Greater Boston area continues to  enjoy a modest boom, with vacancy rates around 5  to  6 percent in all sectors, both downtown

and in  the suburbs. Connecticut is said  to  have experienced significant improvements in  its economy, leading to lower vacancy rates even in  downtown Hartford. Maine and  Vermont are not  doing as  well, with more variation across sub-regions and sectors.

Despite strong markets, most contacts report little new  construction. The low  rate of construction constitutes the  main difference between the current boom and  the 1980s, and  it reflects banks' reluctance to  extend credit for speculative construction as  well as  more caution by  everyone. Most contacts predict, however, that continued favorable economic conditions may soon lead to  more construction.

Nonbank Financial Services

Respondents at  insurance companies report mixed sales for the third quarter of  1996 compared to  the third quarter of 1995. The  biggest increases in  sales are for  variable annuities and  mutual funds. Sales are  also strong in  international subsidiaries, particularly in  Latin America and  Asia. Sales of traditional life insurance are weak. Only two respondents report increases in employment in  the third quarter. The rest cite a  downward trend in employment which they  expect to  continue for the rest of  the  year.

The Outlook

The New  England Economic Project (NEEP), a  nonprofit forecasting group, released its semiannual regional forecast in  mid  October. NEEP expects regional employment to  continue expanding 1.2 to 1.4 percent per  year, with modest declines in  manufacturing and  most of  the net job  additions in  services and  trade. New  England's unemployment rate is  forecast to  remain below 5.0 percent over the  next several years, although the size of the labor force should begin to  expand.
