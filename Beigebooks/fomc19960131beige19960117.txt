FIRST DISTRICT -BOSTON

Business activity in  the First District continues to  expand slowly, with sectoral patterns following those previously reported. Retail contacts again report mixed but generally disappointing results; manufacturers remain more upbeat, with many experiencing solid growth. Price pressures are reportedly minimal. Temporary employment continues to  expand. Most sectors and  areas in the region's commercial real estate market are  holding their own. The insurance industry saw sales pick up  in  the fourth quarter.

Retail

First District retailers express disappointment with the lackluster holiday season, despite a burst of last-minute shopping activity before Christmas. Some respondents report sales declines of up to  10  percent in November. Sales levels at contacted firms in  December ranged from 10 percent declines to  5 percent gains from a year earlier. Apparel continues to  sell poorly. One bright spot in December was the high demand for snow-related equipment, which offered home supply and  hardware companies some relief from an  otherwise steady decline in sales for  most of the second half of 1995. Retail respondents view the first half of 1996 with uncertainty, anticipating sales changes ranging from 6 percent decline to  5  percent growth.

Most vendor prices remain stable, including the prices of lumber, leather, and  paper, which earlier had  increased dramatically. One contact cites recent price increases on  fabric and  foam upholstery. None of the contacts reports increases in  customer prices. Gross margins held or  declined slightly for  most of 1995, but  profits were generally down because of sluggish sales. Contacts do  not expect to  expand employment and  many  plan cuts in capital spending in 1996.

Manufacturing

First District manufacturing contacts generally report that sales are ahead of year-earlier levels. Microelectronics and  innovative computerrelated products continue to  experience robust growth. Machine tool demand is higher than a year ago. Sales to  the health care industry are described as either recovering or  continuing to  grow. Except for selected gains in  market share, makers of consumer durables products and  parts report zero to slow growth in revenues from a year ago.

Many contacts report little or  reduced cost pressure, while selling prices are flat on  average. Prices for chemicals, rubber, resins, lumber, and fabrics are reported to  have stabilized or  declined. Paper and  metals costs continue to increase, however. One-third of the respondents express concern about profit margins in  view of the competitive pricing environment.

Capital spending trends vary widely, but about one-half the contacts report aggressive programs to  modernize or  expand their facilities. Compared to  a year earlier, U.S. employment is  flat to  up slightly at one-half of the firms contacted. Another one-quarter report making substantial net new  hires, while the remaining one-quarter have cut back through attrition. Businesses that are hiring report that strong competition is forcing higher compensation for information systems specialists. In  addition, a  couple of contacts located outside major metropolitan areas indicate difficulties finding qualified production workers. Manufacturers report average wage and  salary increases of between 2  and  4  percent, which they tend to  view as  modest.

Most contacts expect reasonably good outcomes in  1996, given an environment of  moderate GDP  growth and  little inflation. Several have modified their sales projections, however, because of sluggish automotive sales or  financial difficulties at  retail chains.

Temporary Employment Firms

Personnel supply firms report good  performance overall for  the fourth quarter of 1995. Demand for  workers in  technical and specialty fields remains high, and contacts note an  increase in  high-tech workers voluntarily leaving full-time payroll employment to  work on  a  contract basis. Vendor-on-premises operations, in  which a personnel supply firm contracts to  perform all of a client's recruiting and  hiring functions, continue to  enjoy popularity among larger clients. Smaller, more specialized personnel supply firms have begun subcontracting with the larger firms winning the vendor contracts to  obtain employee placements. All those contacted were optimistic about continued growth in 1996.

Commercial Real Estate

Respondents generally agree that the commercial real estate market in New England has been steady. Most contacts complained about a weak Christmas season and its effects on  the retail sector. Although no  increases in retail vacancy rates have been seen yet, respondents anticipate higher vacancy rates and lower rents in  the near future. The office market has  either recovered or remained flat everywhere except for Hartford, where mergers and  bankruptcies have led to rising vacancy rates. The downtown Boston office market has been flat, with no  new  office buildings added and  slightly higher rents. The suburban Boston office market, by  contrast, has  been doing very well.

Nonbank Financial Services

Most respondents at insurance companies report strong sales in  the fourth quarter of 1995. However, sales for  1995 as  a  whole are reported to  be slightly below sales for 1994. Employment at  responding companies was flat to down in  the fourth quarter. Several respondents expect employment to  decline in  1996 on  account of mergers and consolidations.

SECOND DISTRICT--NEW YORK

Reports n  economic  conditions   the  Second  District  ggest  hat  rowth  has  slowed  in o in su t g recent  eeks.
