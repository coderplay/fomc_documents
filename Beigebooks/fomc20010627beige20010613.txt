EIGHTH DISTRICT -ST. LOUIS

Summary

The District onomy,  particularly  e  manufacturing  sector,  ontinues  to  show  signs ec th c of  sluggish rowth. Growth at  manufacturers  continues  to  slow,  and profit  argins continue g m to  narrow. Service  providers  are  also  feeling   pinch,  but  to  a lesser egree.  High fuel a d prices  have forced  some  trucking  ompanies  to  either utback  their  leets  r  shutdown. c c f o Housing markets are experiencing  a seasonal  boost,  with  sales  and prices ncreasing i around the  District. nstruction  activity  s also  picked  up. Banks  have recently  ightened Co ha t credit tandards  on many  of  their  oan  products;  at  the  same  time,  demand s l for ome  of s these  loans  has weakened  moderately. The spring  planting s  essentially mplete. Crops i co are in  good-to-excellent ndition verall,  lthough  there  has been  some  army worm co o a damage reported.

Manufacturing  and  Other Business  Activity

Contacts report hat  growth in  the  manufacturing  sector  has continued  to  slow, t causing  profit  argins to  narrow further.  any  industries, ch as furniture,  creational m M su re boat,  aluminum, leather nd auto parts  manufacturers,  continue  to  downsize and, in  some a cases,  close  plants.  In orthern  Mississippi, r xample, more than 1,800  jobs  have been n fo e lost ecause several  plants ave closed  or  moved b h away.  On the  other  hand, some manufacturing  firms  have made  plans  to  expand or  locate o  the  District. r  example, firms t Fo in  the  high-tech,  obacco and chemicals  industries  lan  to  open new  plants  in  Kentucky and t p Tennessee  by next  year.

The service  sector as also  been affected y the recent  economic slowdown,  but  to h b a lesser xtent  than manufacturing.  One  area of  concern,  for xample, is  distribution  d e e an logistic rvices.  A Memphis  contact  notes  that here  has been a  slowing  in  the  number  of se t packages and amount  of  freight  eing shipped. Consequently,  one of  the  District's  nd b (a

VIII-2

nation's)  argest ackage handling  companies, FedEx, has announced  a hiring reeze  and a l p f suspension of  employee  profit  haring.  The trucking ndustry ontinues  to  experience  profit s i c losses  because of  the  high  price f  fuel. hese  losses  have forced  many  small  trucking o T companies  to  file  or hapter 11  protection, ile  larger irms  cope by parking  portions f f C wh f o their  leets  nd laying ff orkers. Contacts  have noted that  recent  earnings  reports eem f a o w s to  foretell  possible ngoing decline n  profits  or he  rest f  2001. a o i f t o

Real  Estate and  Construction

Residential eal  estate  sales  and median  prices  have continued  to  increase  across r the  District er  the  past  six eeks.

Homes o a ma in  the  midto-high rice  range ($150,000  and above) have been the  fastest  ellers.  ommercial  real p s C estate  activity  s been  more  mixed.  In arts  of  west Tennessee, for xample, commercial ha p e real  estate ales  have been  strong.  In he  St.  Louis  region, n the  other  hand, downsizing s t o at  several  companies  has increased  the  availability ublease space,  which has thwarted of  s the  momentum of  commercial real  estate  sales.  Vacancy  rates  in  this rea are  up for oth a b office  nd industrial ace. a sp

Residential  onstruction  s  strong  in  most parts f  the  District. ril onthly building c i o Ap m permits  in  more  than  half f  the  District's  tropolitan reas  were  up,  in  some  cases by 15 o me a percent  or  more.
