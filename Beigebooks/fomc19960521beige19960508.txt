FIRST DISTRICT -BOSTON

The First District economy is expanding at  a moderate pace. Retail results in  March and  early April were mixed, ranging from  double-digit sales gains to  double-digit declines from  a  year earlier; some of  the laggards saw  a pickup in  recent weeks. Manufacturers are  more upbeat, with most reporting solid first-quarter gains. Inventory levels are not  out of  line, according to both retail and  manufacturing contacts. With few  exceptions, selling prices and input prices are  said to  be  stable. Commercial real estate markets in  most of New  England are improving slowly. Insurance sales are  increasing.

Retail

First District retailers report extremely varied results in  March and April. Chains selling upscale apparel or  specialty non-apparel cite sales increases ranging from 4  to 13 percent over year-earlier levels, and one  food chain notes unusual gains of  2½  percent. Other contacts posted 0 to  10 percent losses in  March and  early April. A  few of  the latter, however, are encouraged by  a  very recent pickup in  sales activity, attributed to  the long-awaited arrival of  spring. Retail respondents are moderately optimistic about the economy over the  next six  months and  anticipate sales growth of 0 to 5 percent. They continue to  express concern, however, about tough competition, particularly from national chains which are  strengthening their position in  the region.

Vendor and retail prices remain stable. While gross margins are  typically holding, profits vary greatly. Retailers are  satisfied with current inventory levels; many contacts have updated their inventory systems in recent years. Less than one-third of  respondents anticipate growth in  capital spending and employment this year. Wage increases of  2  to 5 percent are expected.

Manufacturing

Almost all First District manufacturing contacts indicate that first quarter 1996 revenues increased from a  year earlier, with close to  half experiencing double-digit growth over this period. For  most, recent sales trends are similar to those in the second half of 1995. Especially large gains relative to a  year ago are reported for computer networking and  miscellaneous microelectronics products, industrial machinery, and  equipment used in residential and commercial construction. (Some  contacts alluded to  press reports of  a  slowdown in  the semiconductor industry while indicating that their own related business is in  good shape for the next 6 to 12 months.) Respondents report that sales of  equipment to  the pharmaceutical and  health care industries are growing faster than in 1995, while sales to  the automotive industry have slowed slightly. Demand for  apparel textiles generally remains weak, although one contact cites positive trends for  materials used in  upscale clothing.

Inventories generally are in line with plans. Many respondents indicate long-term efforts to  reduce their inventory-to-sales ratio, however, and some firms in  the textile and  paper products industries report modest degrees of overstocking. One  contact expects customers to  stock packaging materials in anticipation of  a  price increase for  polyethylene.

Selling prices and  materials costs are reported to  be  largely stable. Some respondents have raised prices to reflect higher-cost steel and  other metals or  to  improve margins. Paper and  wool prices reportedly have softened after rising considerably last year.

About three-quarters of  the respondents have increased employment during the past year, but future trends are  expected to  be  more mixed. Some

manufacturers report difficulties filling software and  telecommunications positions, but  none indicates generalized wage pressures. Investment plans vary widely; over one-third of those contacted mention efforts to  rein in capital spending.

Commercial Real Estate

Commercial real estate in  New  England has improved somewhat lately. Most markets are beginning to recover from the long winter. Contacts report gradual absorption of  the existing stock, leading to  slowly decreasing vacancy rates. No  major new construction is reported. In  addition, confidence is said to  be low, preventing developers from  making new investments and  banks from lending them  money.

Rental rates have been going up slightly or  have levelled off in  most markets. However, contacts view these price movements as too small to  make up for the large price decrease that took place over the last several years. While downtown Boston and  the greater Boston area have been doing very well, Maine, Rhode Island, and  Connecticut have seen only very minor increases in  activity. In  all the states, the retail market seems to  be the slowest to  recover, while the industrial sector and apartment building sales are stronger.

Nonbank Financial Services

Respondents at  insurance companies reported an  increase in  sales in  the first quarter of  1996 compared to the first quarter of  1995. Employment, however, continued its downward trend, mostly because of  continuing consolidations and  mergers in  the region. The consolidation trend reflects the spread of  managed care, as insurance companies providing fee-for-service health insurance merge with managed care providers.

SECOND DISTRICT--NEW YORK

Second  District  conomic  conditions ave weakened e h somewhat over  the past  two months, despite  a modest pickup  in  job  growth. Reports from retailers  re very  mixed in  March  and April,  ith we w year-over-year  hanges ranging  from outright  eclines o  double-digit  ins;  but  on balance,  sales  were c d t ga weaker  than in February and  a  bit  below plan.  Job growth  has  accelerated  somewhat,  but a corresponding increase in  labor  force  participation  s  kept unemployment ha rates  from declining. Finally,  anks'  delinquency  rates, hich had  been  rising,  eveled  off n  the past  two months, while b w l i demand for ommercial and industrial ans  picked  up. c lo

Consumer Spending

March  and April etail  ales  in  the  region  varied  substantially  ong r s am the  retailers rveyed but su were  generally eaker than in  February. An  early  Easter  distorted  onthly sales  figures,  oosting w m b March at  the  expense of  April;  or  he  two months together,  ear-over-year  hanges  in  same-store  sales f t y c ranged from a decline  of 1 percent  to  a double-digit  ncrease-overall  ins  averaged slightly  re i ga mo than 3 percent, own  from d 6 percent  in  February. A number of  contacts  reported  that ales  were below s plan,  but  all eported  that nventories  ere close  to  desired  levels r i w by late pril. A

Unseasonably  cold  weather reportedly  ad a moderately negative  impact  on sales, articularly h p in March.  One  contact  attributed  ebruary's  strength-and arch-April eakness-to earlier-thanF M w usual  tax  refunds.  Apparel,  especially  omen's, generally utperformed other erchandise categories w o m and  demand was  considerably  stronger  for  upscale apparel than for  more  moderate  lines.  Most retailers e  holding  prices teady, hough reports uggest  somewhat ar s t s less  discounting han  a year  ago. t Costs for  merchandise and labor re generally  lat. a f

Construction &amp; Real Estate

Commercial  real  estate  markets in  the  New York metro area were  stable  in  March. A dip  in leasing  activity  shed  Midtown Manhattan's office  acancy rate  back up to  14.2 percent (matching pu v December's  level),  rom 13.9 percent  in February.  But downtown's  rate  edged  down  for  the  fifth f consecutive  month, to  24.6 percent  in  March, versus  24.7 percent  in  February and 25.7 percent  last

October. In  the  first arter,  orthern  New  Jersey's ffice  acancy rate  fell  rom 19.2 to  18.7 percent qu n o v f (a  six-year  ow);  rates dged  up in  Westchester and Fairfield  ounties,  ut  are lower  than a year  ago. l e c b

Reports on the residential al  estate  market were mixed in  April.  Contacts  in  downstate New re York continue  to  experience  a better pring  selling  eason  than last  ear-both raffic  d sales  are s s y t an up.  However,  builders eport  no recovery  in  the  Albany area (which  has been  depressed by state r government  downsizing), nd only  a moderate  pickup  in  the  western tier  f  the  state n  recent  weeks. a o i New  home  sales  across  upstate  New  York remain weaker than  a  year  ago; while  the  inventory f  new o homes  is  very  low,  a large  supply  of  existing  omes  for ale  is  depressing  the  overall arket. h s m

New  Jersey  builders  ay that ales  and traffic  ve slowed a bit  n  recent  weeks, following s s ha i a first-quarter kup,  and that  sales  are lower  than  a year  ago-one contact escribed  the  market as pic d "listless", noting  that hile  consumer  pessimism  has diminished, o has the  sense of  urgency to  buy. w s Apparently, he  recent  rise n  mortgage  rates  has,  thus  far,  ot  been much  of  a factor. t i n

Manufacturing

Regional surveys of purchasing managers were  mixed  in April. Business  conditions  in metropolitan  New  York City's anufacturing  sector  improved in  April ut  were still   the  weak  side m b on (outside  the manufacturing  sector, ocal onditions  continued to be  mildly ositive). onversely, l c p C purchasing  managers  in  the  Buffalo rea  reported  that usiness  conditions  n  the  manufacturing  sector, a b i which had been quite  favorable hroughout  the  first arter,  eteriorated  harply  in  April. pparently, t qu d s A this ncipient akness  was not  directly lated o  the  GM i we re t strike, ich is  estimated  to  have idled ,000 wh 6 Buffalo-area  workers at its  peak  in mid-March. Purchasing managers in New York City report continued  declines  in  prices  paid,  but  those  in  Buffalo ite odest  increases. c m

Other Business  Activity

The  district's or  market strengthened  somewhat lab in  the  first arter.  Payroll  employment qu growth was above  trend  in  New  York and New  Jersey,  both  for he  month  of  March  and year-to-date. t New  Jersey's  unemployment rate  has remained  fixed t  6.4  percent  since  January,  while  New  York a State's ose  from 6.0  to  6.5  percent  in  March, after  dging  down  by  0.2  points n  February. (New  York's r e i

rise  was  due  to  a sharp increase  in labor  force  participation,  ich was  accompanied wh by a more moderate  rise n  employment).  New  York City's  ngoing fiscal  ifficulties  e prompted the  mayor to i o d hav accelerate ob  cuts  for he  upcoming  fiscal  ear, hile  a number  of  large orporations-General  ublic j t y w c P Utilities, kin-Elmer,  Kraft,  nd Prodigy  -announced Per a job  cuts  totaling out 1,000  in  the  region.  On ab a brighter  ote,  tourism  continues  to  boom,  with  first-quarter el ccupancy  rates  in  New  York City n hot o climbing  to  a 16-year  high.

Financial  Developments

At  small  and medium-sized banks surveyed in  the  district, rall  emand ove d for ew loans in  April n was  higher  at  about  40 percent  of  the  surveyed banks and steady  at  another  40 percent  compared  to two months  earlier.  ccording to  senior  loan  officers   the  surveyed banks, the  largest ncrease  was A at i seen in  the  commercial and industrial an  segment, with  demand lo higher  at  nearly 35 percent  of  the banks and steady  at  about  45 percent.  Growth  in  demand for esidential rtgage  loans  weakened r mo slightly; mand de is lower at about 30 percent of the banks  and  steady at  another 30 percent. Refinancing  activity  r ll ypes  of  loans  dropped  sharply,  eversing he  upward  trend  that egan  last fo a t r t b November.

Average  loan rates, hich had  been  trending own,  leveled  off  in  April-only  percent  of w d 35 respondents reported  declining  oan  rates, own  from l d 76 percent  in  February;  residential rtgage mo rates  have increased, n balance. With average loan  rates  leveling  ff,  ore  banks than previously o o m reported  a widening of  spreads between  average loan  and deposit  rates. Delinquency rates  have decreased or  remained  the  same  at  more  than 80 percent  of  the  banks.  Banks  were  more or  just  s a willing  o  lend  in  April s in  February,  and credit  tandards  have generally emained  the  same. t a s r
