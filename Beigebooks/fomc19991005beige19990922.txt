SUMMARYÂ¹

All  district  onomies  continue  to  exhibit  verall trength,  ith  most experiencing ec o s w moderate-to-brisk  ates  of  growth. Retail ales  are generally p in ost districts, h r s u m wit back-to-school ales  meeting or  exceeding retailers'  pectations n  many  cases. s ex i Vehicle  sales  remain robust, lthough  some  dealers  are unable  to  meet demand a for popular  models.  Industrial  ctivity   n the  rise n ost parts  of  the  country,  ith  orders a iso i m w and production  both  up.  In ome  cases,  resurgent  Asian demand s is  contributing  o t this ise n ctivity. though commentary  from most district  ports  continues  to r i a Al re highlight  idespread labor  shortages, everal  districts  ve noted a slackening  in  he w s ha t demand for  labor.  There are  few reports f  acceleration  n  nominal wages  and salaries, o i although  some  districts  te a substantial  pswing in he  cost  of  health-care enefits. no u t b While price  pressures  at  the  consumer  level emain mostly  calm, numerous  districts r report ignificant  creases  in ome  materials rices.  Home s in s p sales  and construction remain elevated,  but  many  districts  ve begun  noticing   slowdown.  Commercial  real ha a estate  markets are tight  n any  districts.  an  demand,  except  for  residential al i m Lo re estate  loans,  is ell-sustained  cross  districts.  edit  quality  nd standards  remain w a Cr a unchanged,  for he  most part.  The  recent  drought  has worsened  crop  and livestock t conditions n he  East  and parts  of  the  Midwest. i t

Consumer Spending

Most districts  port hat  retail  ales  are up from their  ear-ago levels. ack-tore t s y B school  sales,  in articular,  ther  et or  exceeded  expectations n  the Boston,  Chicago, p ei m i

Philadelphia,  ichmond  and St.  Louis  districts.  e Atlanta istrict, ever, reports R Th d how declining ales  from a year  earlier, ile  the  Kansas  City  and New  York districts s wh indicate  ixed or  flat  ales.  The San  Francisco  district  tes  that  back-to-school m s no shoppers remained cautious  this ear,  searching  for argains  and delaying  purchases y b until  abor Day sales  arrived. pparel sales  have been brisk n  the  Atlanta,  leveland, L A i C Kansas  City, hiladelphia  nd St.  Louis  districts,   not  in  the  Chicago district    parts P a but or of  the  New  York district.  e Minneapolis  district  ports  strong  sales  of  high-end Th re electronics  n  Minnesota.  Hot weather hampered  sales  of  lawn-and-garden goods  in i the  New  York,  Richmond and St.  Louis  districts.  st districts  port hat  retailers' Mo re t inventories  re  at  desired  levels,  lthough  some  contacts  in  the  Cleveland  district  te a a no that heir  nventories  re a bit ean.  On  the  other  hand, some  contacts  in  the  Kansas t i a l City  district  lieve hat heir  nventories  re too  high. be t t i a

Auto sales, articularly    new  vehicles,  emain strong  in  most parts  of  the p of r country.  The Cleveland,  Dallas, ansas  City  and St.  Louis  districts  te  substantial K no gains  in  auto  sales, hile  the  Richmond w district  ports  a  weakening  of  sales, ue re d mostly  to  hot  weather. Consequently,  dealer  inventories  n  the  Richmond i district  e ar up. On  the  other  hand, some  dealers  in  the  Cleveland,  Philadelphia  nd St.  Louis a districts  e  still  ving difficulty cking nough  popular  models to  meet demand; ar ha sto e inventories  re not  a concern for ealers  in  the  Kansas  City istrict. a d d

Manufacturing

Manufacturing  activity  pears to  have accelerated  in  almost  every  district.  e ap Th Richmond  district,  wever, reports  some  moderation in  the  rate  of  growth. The ho Kansas City  district  tes  that ts ontacts  are  experiencing heir  ighest apacityno i c t h c

utilization  vels n  a year.  The Chicago, Cleveland and St.  Louis  districts  port olid le i re s demand for  steel nd other  metal products,  particularly  om the  auto  industry.  he a fr T Boston, Dallas  and Minneapolis  districts  te strong  demand no for emiconductors and s computer components.  The  San  Francisco  district  ports hat  improving  demand re t from East Asia  has boosted orders  in  the  electrical  uipment,  wood, chemicals, rocessed eq p food and industrial chinery industries. ndustrial chinery production  also ma I ma accelerated  in  the  Atlanta istrict  d rebounded  in  the  Boston district. d an

The  production  of  apparel  appears to  be down  across  the  board. Orders for heavy trucks  and construction  nd agricultural  uipment have weakened a eq at  Chicago district  rms.  While the  tobacco industry  n  the fi i St. Louis  district    experiencing is a slackening  in  domestic demand,  tobacco  shipments from Richmond  district  rms fi remain strong.  The commercial aerospace industries  n  the  Atlanta nd San  Francisco i a districts  port eakening demand. re w

The  Philadelphia  istrict  tes  that anufacturing  inventories  re  at  desired d no m a levels. he  Atlanta istrict  mments T d co that  a maker  of  batteries  nd flashlights  pects a ex heavy demand around year-end and,  therefore,  lans  to  increase  its nventory p i accordingly. leveland district  ntacts  report  no inventory tockpiling,  ile  San C co s wh Francisco  district  ntacts ave seen their  xcess inventories  rawn down  recently. co h e d Contacts in  the  Kansas  City  district  an  to  trim  inventories  oon because they  are pl s getting oo  high. t

Labor Markets

For  the  most part, he  theme  of  this eport s  unchanged  from recent  reports: t r i The demand for  labor ontinues  to  outstrip  he  readily  vailable  upply  of  labor  in  most c t a s

areas. The Atlanta,  hicago, Minneapolis  and Philadelphia istricts  te  that ight  abor C d no t l markets remain the  norm.  Retailers n  he  Boston, Kansas  City  and New  York districts i t reported  that hey  cannot  find nough  staff  o  fill  cancies.  Manufacturers in  he t e t va t Boston and St.  Louis  districts  press  the  same  concern. A couple  of  districts  ntinue ex co to  highlight e  construction  ndustry's going labor  supply  problems,  although  the h i on number  of  these reports  has lessened somewhat. Demand at  temporary employment agencies remains on the  upswing  in  he  Boston, Dallas  and Richmond t districts, le whi remaining steady  in  he  Cleveland district.   ontrast,    few districts  ve noticed  a t Inc a ha slight  asing  of  labor arket tightness. he  Richmond  district  ports hat e m T re t manufacturing  employment  and hours have grown  at  a  slower  pace than  they  had previously. he completion  of  Y2K-compliance  work in  ome  industries  n  he  Dallas T s i t district  s reduced the  demand ha for  technology  workers,  while  weakness  in  he  San t Francisco  district's mercial aircraft dustry  as led  to  layoffs  t  major producers com in h a and suppliers.

Wages and  Prices

On  balance,  wage  and salary ncreases  remain within he  range noted in i t previous  reports.  Wages at  manufacturing  firms  are reportedly  icking p in  he p u t Minneapolis,  Philadelphia  nd Richmond  districts, aining  steady  in  he  St.  Louis a rem t district,  easing  somewhat and in  he  Kansas  City istrict.  e Boston and Minneapolis t d Th districts  te  that ages  at  retail  stablishments re  growing between  3  and 5  percent; no w e a in  he  Kansas  City istrict, ailers port eeling  ncreased  wage  pressures. The t d ret re f i Cleveland and Dallas  districts  te  accelerating  age  growth,  particularly  ong no w am some classes  of  temporary  workers.  The Atlanta nd Minneapolis  districts  port harp a re s

increases  in  the  employer costs  of  health-care  enefits. b

The majority f  district  ports  indicate  hat rice ressures  at  the  retail  evel re o re t p p l a not readily  pparent. Where  they  are  apparent,  they  are categorized  as temperate. a Prices  pressures  at  the  wholesale  level ppear to  be somewhat  greater. he Chicago, a T Cleveland and Richmond  districts  port rice  increases  at  manufacturers,  with  steel re p makers  in he  Cleveland district  nouncing hikes  of  between  5  and 7 percent.  The t an Atlanta,  leveland,  Kansas  City, hiladelphia  nd Richmond  districts  l eport  that C P a al r higher  raw materials osts  are evident.  The  Dallas  district  ds that onstruction  osts c ad c c (both  labor  and materials)  re up between  5  and 8  percent  so far his ear.  The San a t y Francisco  district, ever, notes  that  prices or anufacturers'  inputs  have been how f m "stable r  declining." o

Real  Estate and  Construction

The consensus  across  most districts    that hile  home  sales  remain elevated, is w some  slowing  has recently  ecome b apparent in oth sales  and construction. ome b H sales  have already  weakened somewhat  in  the  Atlanta nd Chicago districts.  e New a Th York district,  wever, reports hat eal  estate  activity    New  Jersey  is  increasingly ho t r in being hampered by supply  constraints-low ventories  f  existing  omes  and a in o h shortage  of  usable land  for ew  construction.  he San  Francisco  district  tes  that eal n T no r estate  markets in outhern California, e  San  Francisco  Bay Area and Washington's S th Puget Sound  region  are robust; lsewhere in he  district, y  have slowed. Just  about e t the all istricts  te igher  mortgage  rates  as a primary  reason for he  recent  slowing.  Other d ci h t reasons include  rising uilding  osts  and market saturation.  any  districts  e  still b c M ar reporting abor  and/or  material hortages, hich are delaying  construction. he l s w T

Richmond  district,  wever, notes that ewer  complaints  about labor r  material ho f o shortages  were received, erhaps signaling  n easing  in  the  pace of  residential p a construction.  Still,   eems  that umbers  of  sales  and new  construction  ermits/starts it s n p in ost districts  e  ahead  of  year-ago levels. m ar

Commercial  real  estate  markets are  tight n  he  Boston and  Philadelphia  istricts, i t d although  real  estate gents in  he  Philadelphia  istrict  lieve hat emand a t d be t d there  may be peaking. The Cleveland district  ports  that  nonresidential  arket conditions emain re m r at  a high level.  Speculative onresidential  uilding  s  up in  the  St. ouis  district. n b i L Apartment construction  s  strong  in arts  of  South Dakota because  of  low  vacancy i p rates.

Banking  and  Finance

Despite  a drop in emand d for  mortgage  and home-refinance loans,  lending activity mains relatively  rong.  Only the  Philadelphia  nd St.  Louis  districts  port re st a re weaker overall oan  demand. l The strength f  business  lending  varies y district, h o b wit only  the  Chicago, Cleveland,  New  York,  Philadelphia  nd Richmond a districts  ting ci growth in he  commercial-and-industrial an  category.  Consumer t lo lending  has strengthened  further n he  Atlanta,  allas  and Kansas  City  districts,  weakened i t D has in the  Philadelphia  nd St.  Louis  districts,  has remained unchanged  in  the  Richmond a and district.  e  Dallas  and Philadelphia  istricts  d that esidential al  estate  lending Th d ad r re remains healthy.  The Cleveland and St.  Louis  districts  port hat ompetition or re t c f deposits  is  strong, hile  banks in  he  Dallas  district  port teady  loan  growth. Banks in w t re s the  Kansas  City  and  New  York districts  ve recently  ightened redit  tandards;  banks ha t c s in  other  districts  port o change  in tandards.  Outside  of  a concern about  agricultural re n s

loan  performance,  credit  uality  emains good. q r

Agriculture  and  Natural Resources

Drought conditions n uch  of  the  East and parts  of  the  Midwest have taken  their i m toll  n both  crops  and livestock.  he Chicago,  Cleveland,  Richmond  and St.  Louis o T districts  l ndicate  hat heir  orn  and soybean crops  are in oor-to-fair  ndition.  he al i t t c p co T Cleveland  district  tes  that he  tobacco crop  is  also  suffering.  he rice nd cotton no t T a crops in he  St.  Louis  district  e in  ood  condition,  hough. The San  Francisco  district t ar g t reports hat  unseasonable weather has lowered the  quality  nd yield f  many  of  its t a o grains, ruits  nd vegetables.  In ontrast,  he  Dallas, ansas  City nd Minneapolis f a c t K a districts  port avorable gricultural nditions,  ith  their  orn  and soybean  crops  in re f a co w c good-to-excellent  ondition  nd with  above-average yields xpected. c a e

Livestock  in  he  Cleveland,  Dallas  and  Richmond  districts  e in  poor-to-fair t ar condition.  Many  farmers  in he  Cleveland  and  Richmond  districts  ve begun  feeding t ha hay to  their  erds because of  poor  pasture  conditions. ome h S farmers in he  Cleveland t district  ve even started aring  down  the  sizes  of  herds. In he  Kansas  City  district, ha p t however, low feed  costs, tronger  cattle  rices nd increasing rofits  re  leading  to  a s p a p a rebuilding  f  herds. o

Strong demand for  natural as has increased  prices  and drilling  tivity    the g ac in Dallas  and Kansas  City  districts.  th the  price f  oil lso  on the  rise,  he  number  of Wi o a t rigs n-line n he  Kansas  City  district  s been  rising. n he  Minneapolis  district, o i t ha I t though,  the  rig ount  is  below year-ago  levels. c
