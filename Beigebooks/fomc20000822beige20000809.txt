EIGHTH DISTRICT -ST. LOUIS

Summary

District onomic activity  t  only  remains strong,  but  has accelerated  somewhat ec no since  the June report.  Business contacts  report ncreases  in  demand i and sales  in  many  industries.  ight T labor  markets continue  to  stymie  some  firms'  bility    meet  demand,  as District ates nd a to st a metropolitan reas  continue  to  post  historically   unemployment a low rates.  Labor cost  increases, however, remain moderate.  Home sales  are  down  from their  ear-earlier vels,  s higher y le a mortgage  rates  keep away  some  potential  uyers. Banks continue  to  experience  little  posit b de growth,  which is  forcing hem to  seek other  sources  of  funds for oans. Recent rains  have restored t l topsoil  oisture  levels n  parts  of he  District    adequate  levels. rops are generally n  good m i t to C i condition.

Manufacturing  and  Other Business  Activity

Contacts report  pick-up  in  demand a and sales  over  the  past  two months.  Automobile sales, specially  f  luxury odels, have rebounded from a slow  start  his ear. High gas prices e o m t y reportedly ave had only  a marginal  effect  n sales  of  SUVs h o and other  vehicles. emand D for nondurable goods, such as food  products,  is  robust.

Firms continue  to  locate heir  istribution  nters  in  the  District cause  of  its entral t d ce be c location  nd its ccess to  the  hubs of  the  major package  delivery  irms.  For  example, in a a f September, Wal-Mart will  egin building   regional istribution  nter  in  Missouri, reating 00 b a d ce c 6 jobs; wo other  distribution  nters  in  Louisville,  w  under construction, ll  reate  several t ce no wi c hundred jobs  by year-end. A number  of  other  companies, including everal  Internet  ompanies, s c are also  expanding and moving  into he  District. ree e-commerce t Th companies, for xample, have e recently oved  into he  Louisville d Memphis m t an regions, reating ore  than 1,000  jobs.  Continued c m strength  in  financial rkets is  leading  a St.  Louis  brokerage  house to  further  xpand  its ma e headquarters and add  550 new jobs.

A major problem for  a variety  f  firms  continues  to  be labor  shortages,  as District ates o st

continue  to  post  some of  the  lowest  unemployment rates  in  the  country.  Contacts note  that tarting s wages  for  entry-level  ositions  re,  in  some  cases,  upwards  of 8  or  $9 an hour. Signing  bonuses p a $ at  many  firms  are  becoming  larger or oth skilled  nd unskilled  orkers. For  example, UPS f b a w is offering  ts argest onuses ever  to  package  sorters ho  stay  on the  job  one year, nd nurses in i l b w a some  parts  of  the  District e  receiving 2,000 signing onuses.

Overall, owever, labor  cost  increases  are  reportedly oderate. h m

Banking  and  Finance

Deposit  growth,  or  lack hereof,  ontinues  to  be the  biggest  challenge  facing istrict nks. t c D ba To meet loan  demand,  many  banks, especially  ommunity  banks, have been  turning o  the Federal c t Home Loan  Banks to  obtain  funds. Without  this ource  of  funding,  many  bankers report,  hey s t would not  be able  to  meet  loan  demand. Bankers also  report hat  interest  ate  margins continue  to t r be squeezed, as customers become more  aggressive  in  seeking  lower  loan  rates, hile  the  cost  of w funds remains unchanged  or,  in  many  cases,  increases.

According  to  a recent  survey  of  large anks in  the  District,  tal  oans  outstanding  are  up b to l almost 2 percent  since  late pril.  Both the  real state  and commercial and industrial  an A e lo categories re up more  than 2 percent  over  the  period; onsumer  loans,  though,  are  down  almost a c 3 percent.  Total  deposits  at  these banks are  down  more  than 4 percent  over  the  same period. Agriculture  and  Natural Resources

In Illinois,  the  other  hand, this ear's rop is  off  y on y c b nearly  16 percent  because  of  both a decrease in  acreage harvested  and a moderate  decline n i yields. ields  in  Kentucky and Tennessee  are also  off  rom last ear's  levels,  ven though the Y f y e acreage harvested is  up.
