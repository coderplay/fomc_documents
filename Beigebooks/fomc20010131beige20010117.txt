The District onomy  shows  several  signs  of  slowing.  Sales during  the  recent  holiday ec season  have been weak  and  below expectations,  eaving  many  retailers th  overstocked l wi inventories.  arly  winter eather hurt.  New  and used vehicle ales  are also  slow,  and inventories E w s are high. Declines  in  demand have affected any  industries;  owever, these  declines  have helped m h to  ease labor  market tightness omewhat. s Many  firms' rofits  re  being  squeezed p a by high  fuel osts. c Although new  housing construction ontinues  to  slow,  home  sales  have recently icked  up in  some c p areas. Loan  demand has softened  somewhat, while  loan  growth has been very  mild. Several makers  of ertilizer  e stopped producing and,  instead, ave been selling  heir  atural as stocks f hav h t n g on the  market to  boost  profits.

Consumer Spending

Retailers eport eak  sales  during  the  2000 holiday  season.  Despite  a  last-minute  ickup  in r w p activity  st  efore  and after  hristmas,  contacts eport hat,  verall,  ales  are  down  5 percent  on ju b C r t o s average from a  year  earlier.  nclement  weather resulted  in  many  stores  losing ales  over  several I s periods  during  the  season, which partially  counts  for ales  growth that as  below expectations. ac s w The weather did  spur  strong  sales  of  seasonal  products, uch as winter oats,  clothing  nd boots. s c a Contacts  at  several  major  department stores  report hat lectronics  nd small  appliances ave also t e a h been popular  sellers.  ine  jewelry nd women's  apparel, owever, have not  moved  well.

Manufacturing  and  Other Business  Activity

Contacts in  a variety  f  industries  re  experiencing  noticeable lowdown  in  demand. o a a s Slowing demand has helped ease labor  markets somewhat,  which has enabled firms o  fill  me  of t so their  acant  positions.  ontacts continue  to  cite  igh  fuel osts  as a  major  problem. Although many v C h c firms  pass on these  higher  costs  to  customers as surcharges, rofit  argins are  still  ing p m be squeezed.

Weak  demand for utomobiles has caused two manufacturers to  idle everal lants  for  at a s p least ne week.  The  local teel  industry ontinues  to  weaken,  with  several roducers going  out  of o s c p business  in  the  past  few months  because of  lower  demand and foreign ompetition.  The wholesale c trade  industry  n  northeast rkansas and the  furniture  anufacturing  industry  n  northeast i A m i Mississippi  re both  experiencing  reduced profits  ecause  of lower  demand. a b s The District's  parel ap industry ontinues  to  shrink,  s a Fruit f he  Loom c a o t plant n  Arkansas closes  to  eliminate xcess i e production  capacity.

Nonresidential a in o construction as been mixed,  with  pockets  of  activity    some  areas,  such as Little  ock,  and h in R substantial  lowing  of  the  market in  others, uch as  St.  Louis.  As a result  f  the  slower  residential s s o and nonresidential  onstruction,  ewer  contractors re  experiencing  backlogs. c f a

Banking  and  Finance

Total  loans  outstanding  at  a  sample of  small  and mid-sized  District nks are  essentially ba unchanged, growing only  0.4  percent  between  mid-October and mid-December,  thus  continuing a trend  of  mild  growth. Several  contacts  are  reporting hat oan  demand t l has recently oftened s somewhat.  Growth in  commercial and industrial  ans  and real  estate  loans  has been stagnant lo during  this eriod.  Consumer p loan  growth,  however, is  down  about  a percentage point; t  ad been i h up about 1.4 percent  between  mid-August and mid-October.
