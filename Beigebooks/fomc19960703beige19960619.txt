FIRST DISTRICT -BOSTON

The  First District economy expanded moderately in  April and  May. Manufacturers generally report solid growth, residential real estate had a strong first quarter, and  temporary employment firms and  money management businesses continue to  grow. By exception, retailers report disappointing sales, citing continued upheaval in  the region's retail sector. Input prices are  mostly stable, while some manufacturers are raising selling prices slightly. Retail

Many retail contacts in  the First District express disappointment with April and  early May  sales growth, which ranged from 22 percent declines to 7 percent increases compared with year-earlier levels. Shopper traffic was particularly slow in  off-price discount chains. The exceptions were a  retailer of home furnishings with double-digit sales growth in  April and  May, and  a hardware chain reporting record-breaking sales in  late May, which they attribute to the arrival of  summer weather. Most retail respondents are optimistic about the economy for  the second half of 1996, anticipating sales growth ranging from flat to 15 percent over previous year levels. Off-price discount retailers note, however, that fierce competition is likely to force more companies into bankruptcy.

Most vendor and retail prices remain stable; an  exception is lumber prices, which have risen steeply in  the last six weeks. Gross margins typically are holding or  improved, while profits vary greatly. Contacts are satisfied with their inventory levels. Only one respondent reports major increases in capital spending and  employment for this year or  the next.

Manufacturing

Two-thirds of the First District manufacturers contacted report solid sales gains relative to a  year ago. Areas of  improvement include consumer

durables and  nondurables, as  well as a broad variety of  capital goods.

Companies tied to the automotive industry expect favorable conditions to  last at least through 1997. By exception, demand for hospital equipment continues to be held down by managed care, and  conditions in  the paper industry are  weaker than a  year ago. Contacts report that European markets, notably Germany, remain sluggish. Other than Latin America, sales to  developing countries are  said to be growing (although sometimes from  a  low  base).

During 1995, paper users had  been accumulating stocks aggressively in anticipation of  rising prices; these holdings have been reduced, and  one contact says further declines are warranted. Most other manufacturers believe their inventory levels are appropriate, although inventory/sales ratios continue to adjust to structural changes. For example, one manufacturer of  consumer durables indicates a  need for  higher stocks of finished goods because retailers are reluctant to hold inventories in  advance of  the holiday season.

Over half of  the contacts are achieving small increases in  selling prices, while most report that prices of raw  materials are flat to down. The prices of paper and  plastics, in  particular, have fallen from year-ago levels. By contrast, prices of foam, polyester yarns, glues, and  some metals are said to  be creeping up.

Almost half the sample report increased employment over the  past year. Low  rates of  local unemployment are causing some firms to recruit professionals from other parts of  the country. Wages and  salaries are said to  be rising in the range of  2  to 5  percent.

Temporary Employment Firms

Demand for temporary services remained strong over the first half of  1996. Information technology continues to lead the other sectors, but contacts report modest demand-driven increases in  wages in  most fields, especially for  highly skilled workers. Industry sources note a  renewed interest in  "temp-to-perm"

placements, in  which companies hire a  worker through an  agency for a  trial period before making a  permanent employment offer.

Residential Real Estate

Contacts report that the residential real estate market was quite strong in  the first quarter of  the year, but  have mixed views as to  developments in  the last two  months. Houses in  eastern Massachusetts, Maine, and  Vermont are reported to be  selling at  a  rate well above year-ago levels, with the growth in eastern Massachusetts and  Maine expected to continue at least through the end of the summer. Sales in  Rhode Island, however, have slowed since the flurry of activity in  the spring. Activity in  western Massachusetts and  Connecticut is also sluggish. Inventory levels are adequate in  most areas, with a  few contacts reporting isolated shortages. Prices are increasing at a  rate of 3 percent, with individual appreciation rates ranging between 0 and 5 percent.

Nonbank Financial Services

Investment management firms report that both assets under management and net sales have increased since the  beginning of 1996. Most respondents have increased employment in  the last two  months, particularly in  retirement plan administration, computer systems, and  operations; candidates are reportedly scarce in  these segments of  the job  market.

The Outlook

The New  England Economic Project (NEEP), a  nonprofit forecasting group, released its semiannual regional forecast in  May. NEEP projects 1.4 percent employment growth for New  England in  both 1996 and 1997, down from the 2.2 percent pace in 1995. Business and  other non-health services are projected to show  the fastest expansions in  employment. The  number of  jobs in  manufacturing and finance-insurance-real estate is expected to  decline slightly in 1996, followed by  a  small increase in 1997.

SECOND DISTRICT--NEW YORK

Second  District  onomic  conditions  ave shown  some  signs  of  improvement  in  recent  weeks. ec h Retail  sales  strengthened  in  May  and were generally  bove  plan, hough they retreated n  early une. a t i J While  there  has been some  softening n  New  York City's  ommercial  real state  market,  the  District's i c e housing market  has improved. The  District's nufacturing sector  accelerated  sharply  in May, ma according to purchasing managers in the New York City  and  Buffalo  areas.  Tourism  remains exceptionally  trong.  There are some  signs  of  price irming n  a number  of  different ctors.  Finally, s f i se banks report  declining  elinquency  rates  and steady  growth in  loan  demand d in  May.

Consumer Spending

Retail ales  in  the  district  rengthened  in  May  and were generally head  of  plan  for he  month, s st a t though business  slowed noticeably  n  early une.  There continued  to  be wide variation  mong i J a the retailers rveyed in  May, with  same-store sales  gains ranging  from less  than 1  percent  to  more  than u 10 percent, ersus  a year  earlier.  n  general,  upscale  product  lines ontinue  to  sell  etter han lowerv I c b t end  merchandise. Much of May's  pickup was  in seasonal merchandise  (air onditioners,  ans, c f swimwear, etc.) nd was attributed  o  warm  weather  following  n unusually ool  April.  It  s  unclear  how a t a c i much  of  the  early-June  slowdown  was weather related.

A few retailers ported  that nventories  ere a bit ean at  the  end of  May, but  with  the  earlyre i w l June sales  slump,  inventories  re  generally ack on or  close  to  target.  irtually  l etail  ontacts  report a b V al r c that they are making  fewer and  smaller  mark-downs on  merchandise  than last ear,  which has y translated  nto  a modest  rise n  effective  elling  rices.  With little    no change  in  merchandise  costs, i i s p or this  has boosted profit  argins somewhat. m

Construction &amp; Real Estate

Commercial  real  estate  markets in  the  New  York metro area weakened slightly    May.  After in holding  steady in  April,  ffice  acancy rates  edged  up in  May, due to  a drop in  leasing ctivity  d to o v a an new  space coming on the  market. Midtown  Manhattan's  vacancy rate  rose  from 14.2 percent  to  14.8 percent  (a  2-year  high)  at he  end of  May, while  downtown's  climbed  from 24.6 percent  to  24.9  percent. t

The  District's sidential  eal estate markets  have  improved, on  balance, though  new re r construction ctivity mains at  a low level.  Realtors  in  New a re York state  report  that ales  of  existing s homes picked up substantially   April,  ollowing  sluggish  first  uarter, hile  selling rices  rose in f a q w p modestly. Permits  to  build  new  homes,  particularly -family ructures, e up sharply rom a year multi st ar f ago-albeit  rom a very  low base. Housing demand f continues  to  be stronger  downstate than upstate. Manhattan's residential ntal arket is  particularly  ght:  acancy rates  are  exceptionally w and rents re m ti v lo on unregulated  apartments have reportedly ncreased by more  than 10 percent  over  the  past  year. i

Realtors  in  northern  New  Jersey  report hat he  market for xisting  omes t t e h is  improving  slowly but  steadily,  th  both  unit ales  and average prices ncreasing t  a 3-5%  rate.  However, homebuilders wi s i a in  northern  New Jersey  report  that arket conditions  ere weak  in  April nd  May-"in  the pits", m w a as described  by one contact.  With inventories  f  unsold  homes o at  a relatively  gh  13 months  worth of hi sales  in  May, builders ave stopped virtually  l peculative uilding. t  the  lower  end of  the  market, h al s b A which includes  mostly  existing  omes,  traffic  d sales  have been fairly od.  In ontrast,  ost newly h an go c m built  omes  are  higher  priced  and are moving very  slowly. oncern  over  job  security  s  viewed as the h C i overriding  onstraint  n demand c o for  higher-priced  omes. h

Manufacturing

Regional surveys of purchasing managers  indicate  strong acceleration n manufacturing a i activity  May. in Purchasing managers in Buffalo  report  that  production  activity,  w  orders,  and ne employment  all ccelerated  sharply  in May, while  commodity  price  pressures increased. Similarly, a purchasers  in  metropolitan ew  York report  sharp improvement  in  manufacturing-sector onditions. N a c The  composite diffusion  ndex  signaled  the  strongest ace of  growth in  more  than  a year and a half, i p although  there  was  only  a modest  increase  in  price  pressures. (A separate  diffusion  ndex  covering i purchasing managers in New York City's  non-manufacturing sectors  signals  continued moderate growth).

Other Business  Activity

The  district's or  market was  stable  in April.  New lab York state's nemployment u rate  edged

down  from 6.5 percent  to  6.4  percent, hile  New  Jersey's dged  up from 6.4  percent  to  6.6  percent. w e Payroll mployment  growth slowed in  April,  ollowing  bove-trend  job  creation n  the  first arter. hile e f a i qu W part  of  this  lowdown s is  due to  an acceleration  n  job  losses  in  manufacturing  and government, much i of  it eflects   temporary statistical rk:  he  survey  week  coincided  with  schools' pring  break. r a qui t s

Tourism continues  to  boom,  with  hotel  occupancy  rates  in  New  York City  holding  at  16-year highs  through  April,  nd average daily  oom  rates  posting  double-digit ins  over  the  past  year.  Two a r ga major transportation  nfrastructure  ojects  ere  recently  ompleted in  northern  New  Jersey:  a monorail i pr w c system connecting  Newark  airport's ree  terminals,  nd a new  rail  ink hat acilitates   commute th a l t f the to  midtown  Manhattan.

Financial  Developments

Loan demand continued  to  increase, ccording  to  a survey  of  senior oan  officers  t  small  and a l a medium  sized  banks in  the  District. mand De for ommercial and  industrial,   well  as nonresidential c as mortgage  loans,  accelerated  slightly    May, with  demand in higher  at  nearly  30 percent  of  the banks and steady  at  approximately  60 percent.  However, demand for onsumer  loans  grew at  a slower  pace than c in  April. efinancing  activity  r ll  ypes  of  loans  continued  to  dwindle,  declining  t  approximately 0 R fo a t a 4 percent  of  the  banks and holding  steady  at  close  to  55 percent.

Loan  delinquencies  decreased  across all  segments  in May. Just  8  percent  of the banks reported  rising  elinquency  rates, own  from 19 percent  in  April. t nearly ll f  the  banks surveyed, d d A a o loan  officers  eport hat redit  tandards have not  changed  and that hey  are at  least s willing  o  lend r t c s t a t as they  were two months ago. Average  loan  rates  are higher  or  stable t  almost  all f  the  respondent a o banks.  The  spread between  the average  lending  rates  and  deposit  rates  widened  at close  to  30 percent  of  the  banks and  held  steady  at  35 percent.

TWELFTH DISTRICT --  SAN FRANCISCO

Summary

Reports from contacts in  the Twelfth District indicated continued strong economic activity in  recent months, with some hints of  an  acceleration in  economic growth. Residential real estate sales volumes and construction generally moved higher, and moderate growth of consumer spending continued. District manufacturing activity picked up  in recent months, particularly among suppliers of  building-related products. Although businesses are increasingly optimistic about the outlook for regional and national economic growth, about one-third of respondents expect inflation to  worsen over the next four quarters.

Business Sentiment

Businesses are increasingly optimistic about the outlook for national and regional economic growth, with about 90 percent of respondents now  expecting national growth over the next four quarters to  match or exceed its long-run average pace, up  from a recent low of about 40  percent in  February. More than half of business contacts expect no substantial change in  national unemployment or inflation in the near term, but about 37 percent of respondents expect inflation to  worsen over the next four quarters, up  from 19 percent in February. Respondents'

expectations for regional economic growth are  particularly optimistic, with about 70  percent predicting better growth in  the region than in  the U.S. as a whole.

Retail Trade and Services

Retail sales in  most District states reportedly were strong and increasing in recent months. Many respondents from the fastgrowing Intermountain states identified auto sales as a  spending category with particularly large gains, but spending on nondurables, such as food and  clothing, also was  reported to  be up  noticeably in  these states. Retail sales appear to  be accelerating in  Washington, after slowing around the turn of the year. Within California, retail spending reportedly has been particularly strong in  the San Francisco Bay  Area, and  most respondents from Southern California noted a  firming of  consumer spending there. Throughout the  District, retailers have experienced increased shipping costs from the spike in  fuel costs, and  most report the fast passthrough of such higher costs to  retail prices.

Tourism activity reportedly is increasing in California, Utah, and some other District states. Hotel occupancy rates reportedly have been high in recent months, although some respondents did express concern that plans for long-distance driving vacations could be affected by  the run-up in  gasoline prices. Among other service-producing industries, computerrelated business services activity reportedly is increasing

rapidly in  Washington and  Northern California, where demand for telecommunications services also remains strong. Long-distance trucking services remain in  high demand throughout the District, despite the recent introduction of  fuel surcharges by shipping companies.

Manufacturing

District manufacturing activity picked up  in  recent months, particularly among suppliers of building-related products. Manufacturers of construction machinery reportedly benefited from increased sales, and orders for  wood products such as lumber were solid. In  the Pacific Northwest, manufacturers of specialty construction items were having trouble keeping up  with the strong pace of orders, so  delivery lags lengthened. Among other investment goods, order backlogs for machine tools were reported to  be  high; demand for computing equipment remained robust, but the pace of increase appeared to slow a  bit. The inventory correction which has  dampened production in industries such as steel, autos, and selected other consumer goods, was perceived to be  near completion.

Agriculture and  Resource-Related Industries

District agricultural producers report mixed conditions. Western cattle ranchers lament a  continued drop in cattle prices, as livestock producers still have not  worked off excess inventory. In  California, production of nuts, tree fruits and

grapes appears to  be  slightly down this season, although grape producers are benefiting from very high demand for  wine grapes.

Real Estate and Construction

District real estate markets were relatively strong in recent months. Respondents noted increasing home sales volumes and  prices, and residential building activity also increased. The growth of  new residential construction was particularly strong in  Oregon, Utah, and Idaho. Within California, real estate and residential construction activity continued to  be mixed, with stronger conditions in  the San  Francisco Bay  Area than in  the Central Valley and Southern California.

Financial Institutions

District bank respondents generally report wide availability of credit, with high levels of  bank liquidity, strong capital positions, and  healthy earnings. Loan volumes were reported to be increasing at selected banks. Increased economic activity reportedly is fueling a  strong loan market in  the San Francisco Bay  Area. However, some California banks are experiencing slower loan growth, with much of the  weakness centered in  consumer loans and first mortgages. In  Washington, loan volumes are robust, particularly in  the commercial and industrial lines. Some bank respondents reported difficulties hiring bank tellers at the prevailing wages, particularly in the tightest labor markets, such as Salt Lake City and  Las Vegas.
