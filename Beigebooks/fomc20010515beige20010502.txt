Almost all istricts  port  slow pace of  economic activity    March  and early pril. d re a in A Retail ales  were weak  in  March, but  strengthened  in  April. till,  tailers   most districts  e s S re in ar expecting  only  small  gains, t  best, n  upcoming  months.  Vehicle  sales  have been  mixed,  with a i demand  for  new  SUVs,  trucks nd luxury ars  generally  own.  Industrial tivity  s continued a c d ac ha to  weaken, with  orders  and production  having  fallen  n  many  districts.  bor market tightness i La has eased in  almost  every  district.  ward  wage  pressures  have generally bated,  only  to  be Up a replaced  with  energy costs  that  have risen harply.  Home s sales  and new  construction  ave h remained steady  or  been picking p in  almost  all istricts.  mmercial  construction  as been u d Co h more uneven  across  districts.  wer mortgage  rates  have spurred  a resurgence of  refinancing, Lo which has helped bolster oan  growth recently. any  districts  te,  however, that redit l M no c standards  are  tighter  ow  than  previously.  he winter heat crop  is enerally n  good condition, n T w g i while  some  delays  in  spring  plantings  nd the  development of  other  crops  have been  noted in a the  Midwest and Plains.  The energy sector ontinues  to  strengthen. c

Consumer Spending

Almost all istricts  port hat  retail les  in  March  were flat-to-down om a year  earlier, d re t sa fr but  showed  improvement  in  early pril. he  Boston, Kansas  City  and San  Francisco  districts A T note  that ales  have been below expectations,  hile  the  Atlanta,  hicago and St.  Louis  districts s w C report hat ales  have either  et or  exceeded expectations.  In  the  Boston, Kansas  City, t s m Philadelphia  nd St.  Louis  districts, -ticket ems-such  as  jewelry,  ppliances  and a big it a electronics-have  een slow movers; in  the  Chicago district, ever, household appliances b how and electronics  ave reportedly  een strong  sellers.  he Chicago and New  York districts  te h b T no that ales  of  seasonal merchandise and apparel  have been weak, while  the  same  merchandise s

has been moving  quite  well  in  the  Cleveland  and Philadelphia  istricts.  e  Minneapolis  district d Th notes  an uptick n  demand i for  used computers lately.  ost districts  port hat etailers' M re t r inventories  re  currently  t  desired  levels;  n  parts f  the  Kansas  City istrict  d in  Idaho, a a i o d an however, some  retailers'  ventories  re a bit igh. Retailers  n  the  Cleveland district  ve been in a h i ha successful t  reducing  their  xcess inventories  hrough  large  markdowns. a e t Almost all istricts d report hat  retailers  e  expecting  only  mild  sales  growth,  if ny,  in  the  upcoming  months, with t ar a contacts  in  the  Dallas  district,  xample, noting  that hey  have lowered their  ales fore t s expectations or  rest f  the  year. f o

Vehicle  sales  are mixed around the  country.  The Cleveland,  Kansas  City, ew  York and N Philadelphia istricts  port hat ales  are  up,  while  the  Chicago, Dallas, ichmond  and St. d re t s R Louis  districts  port hat hey  are down.  Almost across  the  board,  however, districts  te that re t t no higher  gas prices ppear to  have reduced demand  for ew  SUVs,  luxury ehicles nd trucks. a n v a On  the  other  hand, sales f  lower-priced nd used vehicles ave been  relatively  rong, o a h st especially  n  the  Dallas  and St.  Louis  districts  d in  the  Buffalo egion.  Dealers  in  the i an r Richmond  district  ve been trimming  their  nventories  s  sales  have softened; ome  dealers  in ha i a s the  Dallas  and St.  Louis  districts  so  report igh  inventories, pecially  f  SUVs al h es o and trucks.  In other  districts, rent ehicle nventories  re  at  desired  levels. cur v i a

Manufacturing  and  Other Business  Activity

Manufacturing  activity continues  to  weaken  across  districts, h  demand wit having  fallen  n i most industries.  rders and production  are  down  in  the  Atlanta,  oston,  Chicago, Cleveland, O B Minneapolis,  Philadelphia, chmond  and San  Francisco  districts.  me Ri So districts  port hat re t excess inventories, ich had been growing since  the  beginning  of  the  year, re starting  o  fall wh a t because of  production  cuts.  In  the  Boston and San  Francisco  districts, ugh,  manufacturers tho still  press  concerns about excess inventories.  he Philadelphia  istrict's ufacturing ex T d man

sector s  a mixed bag,  with  orders  down  in  April,  ut  shipments  steady.  Furniture ales  have i b s continued  to  decline n  the  Richmond  and St.  Louis  districts  cause  of  slack emand. i be d

The high-tech  and telecommunications industries  re  experiencing  pronounced a a slowdown.  Activity s eased in  the  Atlanta,  hicago, Dallas, hiladelphia,  an  Francisco  and ha C P S St.  Louis  districts, re new  orders  or  sales  of  computer-related quipment have dropped. whe e Sales  of  such equipment in  the  Boston district, ever, are  up moderately. The Atlanta nd how a Dallas  districts  ill  ve excess inventories  f  telecommunications  equipment. st ha o

There were some  scattered reas of  improvement, however.  In  New  York,  for xample, a e conditions  aried  across  the  state:  the  New  York  City nd Buffalo reas  have been bright pots, v a a s with  manufacturers  experiencing  an increase  in  production;  he  Rochester area reports urther t f weakening  in  business  conditions.  ourism and hospitality  mand T de have remained moderately strong  in  the  Atlanta nd Richmond  districts, re  the  Easter  holiday nd spring  breaks during a whe a March  and April ere a boon for hese industries.  usiness travel,  owever, is  reportedly  own, w t B h d with  travel-industry  ntacts n  the Philadelphia  istrict  porting ome  slowing  recently. co i d re s

Manufacturing  contacts  in  the  Cleveland and Philadelphia  istricts  e  optimistic, d ar expecting  orders  and demand to  pick  up by this  ummer. s Boston, Chicago and St.  Louis  district contacts  are uncertain o  pessimistic, th  expectations f  slower  sales  in  the  coming months. t wi o Businesses in  most districts  pect  a slowing  in  capital  pending this  ear;  in  the  Philadelphia ex s y district,  wever,  the  number  of  firms lanning  reductions s  offset  y an equal number  planning ho p i b increases  in  capital  pending budgets. s

Labor Markets

While some  districts  ill  ntion that  labor arkets are  tight, most all ote  that his st me m al n t tightness as been  easing, specially  n  the  manufacturing  sector.  Most contacts  in  the  Atlanta, h e i Boston,  Chicago, Kansas  City  and St.  Louis  districts  ve commented ha that illing  cancies  has f va become  easier.  The Dallas  district, ever, reports hat uality  orkers are  still  usive,  nd how t q w el a

construction  orkers  are  still    short upply  in  the  Chicago and Kansas  City istricts.  illed w in s d Sk workers in  the  energy sector re also  in  short upply  in  the  Kansas  City istrict.  e  New  York a s d Th district  tes  a continuing acklog  of  demand no b for orkers in  the  financial rvices ndustry, w se i though this as become  less  pronounced  in  recent  weeks. Employment h in  the  St.  Louis  district's retail ade  and service  sectors re  picking p because of  strengthening emand. tr a u d

Wages and  Prices

Nearly  all istricts  port hat nergy costs  are  up sharply,  itting  istoric ghs  in  some d re t e h h hi areas. Boston district  ntacts, owever, note  that nergy concerns have waned  somewhat co h e since  the  last  eport. he trucking ndustry as been  hit  he  hardest  by high  gasoline  prices. r T i h t Several  districts, ecially  allas  and San  Francisco, eport hat irms  are  increasingly  assing esp D r t f p on these high  costs  to  customers as  fuel urcharges. Hikes  in  electricity ts  are  concerns in s cos both the  Philadelphia  nd, especially, n  Francisco  districts. a Sa

Upward  wage  pressures  have generally bated. Wages a are  rising  ery  moderately  or v are  unchanged  in  most parts  of  the  country  except  the Richmond  and San  Francisco  districts, where scattered  wage  increases  are  noted. Retail rices re  steady  in  most districts  cept p a ex Richmond, where retail  rices ave been  rising  t  a quicker ace in  recent  weeks.  By and p h a p large, on-energy input osts  are stable,  ith  only  a few  exceptions.  Manufacturing  materials n c w prices  in  the  Chicago and Kansas  City istricts,  xample, continue  to  rise,  hile  construction d fore w materials rices  in  the  Minneapolis  district  ve decreased somewhat. p ha The Dallas  district is experiencing  downward price  pressures  for etals  and high-tech roducts.  The Atlanta nd m p a Chicago districts  te increases  in  health  insurance  costs. no

Real  Estate and  Construction

The consensus across  most districts   hat esidential les  and construction  ave been ist r sa h picking  up or  steady, lthough  segments  of  the  market in  some  districts  e  experiencing  a a ar slowdown.  Agents in  the  Boston,  Cleveland and Richmond  districts  port hat tronger ales  of re t s s low-  to  mid-priced  single-family mes  account  for ost of  the  increase  in  residential tivity. ho m ac The  Boston and New  York districts  te  active esidential al  estate  markets,  although  the  New no r re York district  ports ome  market easing  since  the  last eport,  hile  Boston district  rkets still re s r w ma face  housing  shortages. Home sales  in  the  Chicago district  ve been better han expected, ha t with  price ppreciation emaining  strong  and housing  shortages  persisting.  t.  Louis  district a r S agents  are seeing  excess inventories  f  housing begin  to  shrink. n the  San  Francisco  district, o I home  sales  are  strong  in  Hawaii,  while  they  are  slowing  in  Washington.  The Atlanta istrict d is experiencing  a flat-to-down  rend  in  sales  of  new, single-family mes,  even though strength s t ho i apparent in  most Florida arkets,  where  home  sales  and construction  re up from a year  ago m a and prices  continue  to  increase.  Home construction  s  strong  in  the  New  York district, pite  a i des drop in  demand in  New  Jersey.

Commercial  construction  cross  districts    a bit ore  uneven.  The Philadelphia  istrict a is m d reports hat,  espite  strong  activity,  ntract wards  have recently  eclined.  The  San  Francisco t d co a d district  tes that verall  ctivity mains sound, even though vacancy rates  are  up and rental no o a re rates re  down  in  some  regions  of  the  district.  e Kansas  City istrict  dicates hat ctivity a Th d in t a is flat  nd that ales  and leasing ave fallen.  he Dallas  district    experiencing  a slowing  in a s h T is commercial construction,  ith  demand w for ll ypes  of  nonresidential  pace down.  Construction a t s in  areas  of  the  Cleveland  district   stagnant, ith  many  firms eportedly  utting xpansion are w r p e plans  on hold  indefinitely.  the  St.  Louis  district,  wever, contractors  ndicate  hat here  has In ho i t t been a consistent  low  of  new  projects, trend  they  are  optimistic ll  ontinue. f a wi c

Banking  and  Finance

Lower mortgage  rates  have led  to  a resurgence of  refinancing  n  many  districts.    the i In Richmond  district,   example, a banker has indicated hat efinancing  ow accounts  for lmost for t r n a 90 percent  of  his  bank's  lending ctivity. rtgage  refinancing  s lso  up in  the  Atlanta, a Mo i a Chicago, Kansas  City nd New  York districts.  e Philadelphia  istrict  tes  that ome  equity a Th d no h

loans  are  on the  rise,  s consumers  consolidate ther  debts  into hese  loans.  At the  same  time, a o t many  districts  ve observed declines n  business  loan  activity. e Dallas  district  tes  that ha i Th no businesses  are now frequently  sing  such loans  to  pay for perating osts  instead  of u o c expansions. The New  York and Philadelphia  istricts, ugh,  are  seeing some  upticks n d tho i business lending.  The  Kansas  City nd St.  Louis  districts  port eclines n  consumer  loans, n a re d i a ongoing trend  in  the  St. ouis  district.  e Atlanta, leveland  and  New  York districts, the L Th C on other  hand, have seen increases  in  consumer  loans.  The San  Francisco  district  ports hat re t loan  growth,  in  general, as moderated. h

Half  of  the  districts-Atlanta,  ago, Dallas, ansas  City,  ew  York and San Chic K N Francisco-are eporting ighter  redit  tandards,  particularly  r usiness  loans;  the  Cleveland r t c s fo b district,  wever, reports hat redit  tandards  have remained  essentially changed. ho t c s un The Richmond  district  tes  that enders  have become  more  cautious hen  making  loans  to no l w marginally rofitable sinesses. The Kansas  City  district  ports eposit rowth in  line ith p bu re d g w loan  growth;  the  St.  Louis  district  ports tronger eposit  growth than  loan  growth. re s d

Agriculture  and  Natural Resources

Agricultural ports re  mixed. The winter heat crop  is  developing  well  in  the re a w Cleveland  district,  varied idely  across  the  Kansas  City istrict, ,  because of  abundant is w d and moisture  levels,  s n  good-to-excellent ndition  n  the  St.  Louis  district.  e Cleveland,  Kansas i i co i Th City, inneapolis,  and St.  Louis  districts  te  some  delays  in  plantings  nd development  of M no a other  crops. In  contrast,  he  Richmond  district  ports ood  planting  onditions  or orn,  but t re g c f c notes  that n early pril old  snap caused some  damage  to  apple  and peach crops  and forced a A c vegetable  growers to  replant everal  crops. Limited ater  and high  energy prices re s w a encouraging  farmers  in  the  Dallas  district    plant otton  instead f  corn. Producers in  parts  of to c o the  St.  Louis  district  tend  to ubstitute  otton or orn and soybeans on some  acreage. Most in s c f c crop prices  remain depressed and continue  to  adversely  affect  armers. f

The energy sector  continues  to  strengthen  in  the  Dallas, ansas  City  and Minneapolis K districts.    the  Kansas  City istrict,    count  of  active il  nd gas rigs as risen o  its ighest In d the o a h t h level n  10 years;  in  the  Minneapolis  district,   nd gas exploration  as remained above yeari oil a h ago levels n  response to  higher  prices.  Shortages of  equipment and personnel are  reported  in i the Dallas  and Kansas  City  districts,  mining production  is  decreasing  in  the  Minneapolis and district  cause  of  softening emand be d and high  energy costs.
