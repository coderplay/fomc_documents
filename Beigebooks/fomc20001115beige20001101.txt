(One firm  reports  that t ecently  ncreased  its eferral  onus to  $1,500 from $500.) i r i r b Some upward wage  pressures  also  appear to  be surfacing. or example, in  Columbia, Missouri, F

A  mild  decline n  demand i was felt  n  a  few industries, ch as mining,  chemical i su production  and some  heavy manufacturing,  which led  a few firms  to  downsize.
