FIRST DISTRICT -BOSTON

The First District economy continues to  expand as the summer draws to  a close. Manufacturers and  personnel supply firms report solid growth. Most retail contacts indicate that sales were better than expected in  August. Investment management firms are growing modestly. Residential real estate markets in  much of  New  England are in  good shape. With exceptions, input and selling prices are said to  be stable while wages and  salaries are  up  2  to  4 percent.

Retail

Most retail contacts in  the First District are  upbeat about the economy and report higher-than-expected sales, particularly in  August. Retailers of high-priced apparel and  home building materials cite sales increases from year-earlier levels as  high as  37  percent in  July and  August; by  contrast, two respondents note sales declines of  3  to  9  percent during the summer months compared with a  year ago. Retail respondents are cautiously building inventories in  anticipation of holiday sales, and  they expect 2  to  10  percent sales gains for  the remainder of  the year.

Vendor and customer prices remain stable; by  exception, the retail price of leather has risen 5  to  10  percent and the cost of  lumber continues to  move up. Contacts note that offering fewer sales promotions has  generally improved gross margins; profits, however, are  mixed for the first half of the  year. Capital spending increases this year are limited primarily to improvements in technology. Only one respondent cites a  major reduction in employment; most others have level job counts and  anticipate wage increases of 2  to  4  percent for the  year.

Manufacturing

Most manufacturing contacts in  the First District report that overall sales are solidly higher than a year ago. Incoming orders generally suggest a continuation of  current trends. Results for similar products vary  across firms, however. For example, one  producer reports continued double-digit

increases in the demand for  plastic parts, while another reports sharp declines. Such unevenness extends to  the  medical, industrial, and  utility equipment markets.

On  the whole, inventories are reported to  be  roughly in  line with company targets. However, a  contact in  the  paper industry is curtailing production in order to  eliminate excess inventories. A  producer of industrial machinery intends to  add  to  inventories, while a metals fabricator reports being unable to  do  so  because the company is operating at full capacity.

Manufacturers report that selling and  input prices generally are little changed from a year ago. By  exception, the  price of  memory chips has  fallen by  half in  the last few  months. Thus far, this development has  not led  to  an intensification of the downward trend in  computer prices, however. Paper prices have recovered a  bit from their recent lows but remain far  below yearago levels. Plastics prices have subsided after rising earlier this year, while some metals prices continue to increase a  little.

Most manufacturing contacts indicate that their U.S. employment is flat to slightly higher than a  year ago. Wages and  salaries have increased 2-1/2   4 to percent, with the lower end  of  this range reflecting contracts negotiated in previous years. Businesses recruiting computer specialists or  engineers indicate that they  must offer attractive salaries and  profit-sharing or discounted stock plans. Nevertheless, contacts report that they are able to hire the employees they  need even in such sought-after professions.

Manufacturers typically are continuing to  spend the same amount on capital as last year. Such spending represents sizeable increases in  capacity for about one-third of the contacts.

Temporary Employment Firms

Personnel supply firms in  the First District report very good business in  the summer of 1996, with revenues expanding 20 to 30 percent from a  year earlier. Summer sales rose in  the clerical sector because of student workers and leveled off in  high technology fields, trends that typically reverse in the fall. Temporary-to-permanent job  conversions have subsided, and  workers

reportedly continue to leave full-time payroll employment to  work on  a contract basis for higher hourly pay  and  state-of-the-art projects. Nonetheless, demand for qualified temporary labor is rising faster than supply, so  wages have risen. As  competition continues to  increase, contacts are exploring new  recruiting methods such as  the Internet. Double-digit revenue growth is anticipated for  the remainder of 1996.

Residential Real Estate

The residential real estate market remains in  good shape across much of New  England. Contacts report that sales of  existing homes in  the last two months are above year-ago levels in  Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. A  respondent in  Maine reports that the spurt of  sales earlier in  the spring has slowed substantially in  the last two  months. While the recent activity in  Connecticut and  Massachusetts reflects a  steady trend of sales growth over the last year, reports from Rhode Island and  Maine show  no sustained pattern of  gains or  losses.

Inventory levels are reported to  be  adequate in  most parts of the region except Massachusetts, where one contact suggests that low  inventories could lead to  diminished sales in  the rest of the  year. New construction remains solid overall, and  credit for consumers and  builders is reported to  be  readily available. Contacts note signs of  decline in real-estate-related employment in southern New England, with consolidation reported among brokers in  Rhode Island and  appraisers in  Connecticut.

Nonbank Financial Services

First District investment management firms report modest increases in assets under management since the  beginning of  the second quarter. Inflows into small company and  growth funds were still positive despite the July correction in  stock prices, but  bond funds continued in  net liquidation. Most respondents plan to  increase employment during the rest of the  year, but some report that it takes a  long time to  fill open  positions, particularly in  the area of retirement planning.
