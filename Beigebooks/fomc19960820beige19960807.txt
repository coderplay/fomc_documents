FIRST DISTRICT -BOSTON

Business conditions are generally good in  the First District. Retail results are mixed, with hard-goods chains and  tourism doing especially well. Manufacturers report rising demand for  most products. Input prices are reportedly stable or  declining. Commercial real estate activity is robust in New  England markets. Insurance companies indicate sales vary by  type of product, with their mutual funds having the largest sales gains. Retail

Although June and  July are normally a  slow time for retailers, hardgoods chains in  the First District report good news--double-digit sales gains compared with year-earlier levels. By  contrast, apparel specialty and  offprice chains report sales declines of  from 0 to 5 percent. Respondents' expectations for the next six  months are similarly mixed, ranging from 15 percent growth to 5 percent decline. While most are optimistic about the economy, two contacts express concern with rising consumer debt.

Vendor prices remain stable, with the  exception of paper prices which have reportedly fallen 20 to 30  percent in  the last year. Retail prices are generally level. All respondents express satisfaction with inventory levels. Wage increases range from 3 to  5 percent. Only one contact anticipates significant growth in  capital spending and  employment in 1996.

New  England's tourist offices report strong activity this summer, boosted by  double-digit increases in  the numbers of  international visitors over the  previous summer. The two  airline carriers that provide most of  the region's European service note that foreign travel is up  an  average of  20 percent. Boston area hotel occupancy and  room rates for June were up 3  and 8 percent, respectively, compared with the previous June. Advance reservations suggest New  England's fall tourist season will be  exceptionally strong.

Manufacturing

First District manufacturing contacts report that demand is  higher than a  year ago for  most products. Some indicate double-digit improvements for health care, industrial, and  aircraft equipment. By  contrast, orders for heavy duty truck parts and  memory chips are said to  be  slowing sharply, and the market for apparel textiles remains sluggish. Automotive equipment markets are mixed. Car  production reportedly is increasing, but automakers are shifting suppliers--to the advantage of  some First District contacts and the disadvantage of others. Shifts in  microelectronics and  automotive demand are  prompting some manufacturers to  make inventory corrections.

Most manufacturers indicate that, overall, materials costs are steady, with declines for steel and copper as  well as some chemicals and  selected grades of lumber. Selling prices generally are flat to  up slightly. Because of automakers' continued demands for  price cuts, some suppliers are  deciding to emphasize equipment sales to other industries.

Employment is increasing at a majority of respondent firms, although these expansions are generally modest. Highly skilled machinists and  computer specialists are  reportedly hard to find, but general labor availability is not viewed as a  constraint. Although a  couple of  respondents report wage and salary freezes, most anticipate increases this year in  the 3  to 5 percent range.

Capital spending trends are mixed. Several contacts with ambitious investment plans note they could be  scaled back if  market conditions weaken.

The consensus among manufacturers is that the economy is in  good shape for the remainder of 1996. However, evaluations for individual companies vary depending on  particular products or  technologies, and some contacts mention analysts' worries about an  economic slowdown in 1997.

Commercial Real Estate

Improved economic conditions in  New  England have led  to  a  strong and active commercial real estate market. Contacts report high levels of activity

and significantly lower vacancy rates throughout the  region. The  market is particularly strong in  the Greater Boston area, with very low  levels of inventory and office and  industrial vacancy rates around 10 percent and 7 percent, respectively. Lower vacancy rates are also reported in  Connecticut and  Maine. Contacts note variation across different market sectors. Apartment buildings represent the strongest sector, with low  vacancy rates and high rents throughout, while the retail market is  the weakest.

Commercial rents have gone up  in  the Greater Boston and Portland markets. Contacts anticipate rent increases elsewhere as inventory levels decrease further in  response to  the high level of activity and  limited new construction.

Nonbank Financial Services

Respondents at  insurance companies report mixed sales of  insurance products in the second quarter. Among their lines of  business, mutual funds tallied the  biggest sales gains. Employment was flat or  lower in  the second quarter of  1996 compared to  the second quarter of 1995. The  downward trend in employment is  expected to  continue as the industry consolidates.

Respondents see two important trends in the insurance industry. One trend is continued consolidation. Consolidation is occurring both because of the requirement for  high capital expenditures in  many segments of the industry and  because of ongoing competition within the industry and  with other financial services firms selling investment products to the  consumer. The second trend is restructuring of the distribution system. In  particular, contacts note that selling insurance products through banks provides an opportunity to the industry since it  can  be  more cost-effective than the agency system.

SECOND DISTRICT--NEW YORK

Most sectors  of  the  Second  District's  onomy ec improved in  recent  weeks.  Both the  commercial and residential al  estate  markets continue  to  strengthen-vacancy ates  are  down, construction  f re r o multi-family its as surged,  and sales  of  both new and existing  ingle-family  mes  are  up. Regional un h s ho purchasing managers  report  continued  growth in  the manufacturing sector  in  July.  The  boom in tourism  continues,  ith  New  York City  hotels pproaching  full  ccupancy.  On  a weaker note,  retail w a o sales, hich had been fairly isk  n  May, slowed in  June and July,  nd were generally elow plan;  also, w br i a b banks reported  a slight  ebound  in  delinquency  rates  in  July.  age r W and price  pressures  generally remain subdued, except  in  Manhattan's  tight  eal  estate  market,  where rents  on apartments and hotelr room  rates  have risen  sharply.

Consumer Spending

Retail ales  in  the  district e, on balance,  below plan  in  June and July,  s business  slowed s wer a from May's brisk ace. On  a year-over-year asis, ame-store sales  ranged from a 1  percent  decline p b s to  an 8 percent  gain  in  June,  with ains  of  0 to  6 percent  in  July.  Most department stores ontinue o g c t cite  omen's  apparel, nd upscale  apparel  more  generally,   the  top  performing  categories,  nd home w a as a goods  as the weakest.  Discount chains report  that  only  "consumables"-small-ticket, quently fre purchased items-have  sold  well  in  recent  weeks.  Some of  the  recent  weakness  was  attributed  o t cooler  than usual weather in  June and July  (especially mpared co with  last  ear),  but  a number  of y contacts  believe hat nderlying emand t u d has softened  a  bit. t as noted that une and July  are  not I w J considered  critical  nths  for etailing. mo r

All  of  he  retailers rveyed reported  that nventories  ere on or  close o  target  s of  late uly. t su i w t a J With retailers w  starting  o  build nventories  or he  fall  eason, most say  they  are  "cautious"  n  their no t i f t s i expectations or  the  second  half f  the  year. Virtually l ontacts  report hat heir  ffective  elling f o al c t t e s prices re  steady, hat erchandise costs  are  flat   declining, d that here  are  no wage  pressures. a t m to an t

Construction &amp; Real Estate

The region's ommercial real  estate  markets are  firmer han  they  have been in  a number  of c t

years. In New York  City,  office acancy  rates,  which  had  blipped up  in May,  retreated in v June-midtown Manhattan's rate  fell  o  14.5 percent, rom 14.8 percent  in  May, while  downtown's  rate t f edged  down  to  24.7 percent  from 24.9  percent.  The reduced vacancy rates ere due to  a lack  of  new w properties  oming on the  market  and to  existing  ffice  pace being  converted  to  residential  e;  leasing c o s us activity  emained  steady.  In northern  and  central  New r Jersey,  brisk easing  activity s pushed l ha vacancy rates  down  0.8  points o  17.9  percent  in  the  second quarter-two  oints  lower  than  a  year  ago, t p and the  lowest  level ince  1987. s

The District's  sidential al  estate  markets  were generally trong  in  June,  led  by  the  multire re s family  sector. Manhattan's housing shortage and  double-digit  ent  increases  continue  to make r headlines, hile  prices  for o-ops and condominiums  have reportedly  isen  more  modestly. In  New w c r York State, uilding  ermits  for ulti-family ructures  urged in  both  the  first d second quarters,  nd b p m st s an a are running  at  more than  double last ear's evel. irtually l  he  gains  were concentrated  in  New  York y l V al t City nd its orthern  and eastern  suburbs. a n

Realtors  in  the  district  so  report airly  isk emand  for xisting  ingle-family  mes. al f br d e s ho In  New York State,  second-quarter  sales  surged 16  percent  from a year earlier, ough gains  were  more th moderate in  June. While second-quarter ata  are  not  yet vailable  or ew  Jersey, ost realtors  eport d a f N m r that  the  market is  strong, ueled  by first-time  yers.  Home f bu prices  are rising  t  about a 4 percent a annual rate  in both states.  The  market for  new  single-family mes ho is  mixed. New York State homebuilders report teady  improvement-down-state New  York remains strong, hile pstate  markets s w u are beginning  to  snap out  of  their  hronic  slump.  In  New  Jersey,  however, builders eport hat he c r t t housing market  remains "in  the  doldrums"-traffic ediocre,  there  is  no  sense of  urgency  to  buy,  and is  m affordability ains a problem. rem

Manufacturing

Regional surveys of  purchasing managers  suggest continued  growth in  the manufacturing sector  and  a  slight  ptick  in prices  paid in July. Purchasing managers u in Buffalo  reported  that production ctivity  ld  steady  in  July,  ollowing  risk rowth in  the  second quarter,  hile  new  orders a he f b g w

continue to expand at a  moderate  pace. Meanwhile,  growth  in metropolitan  New York City's manufacturing sector  accelerated  from  its lready rapid  second-quarter  pace, with that  survey's a diffusion  ndex  climbing  to  a new  cyclical gh  in  July.  (A  parallel  urvey  of  purchasing  managers i hi s in New  York City's on-manufacturing sectors  signals teady,  moderate  growth). Finally,  urchasing n s p managers in  both Buffalo nd  New  York report  moderate  rise  in prices  paid,  with  both diffusion a a indices limbing  into he  mid 50's. c t

Other Business  Activity

Labor markets were relatively  able n  June. New  Jersey's  unemployment  rate  held  steady  at st i 6.1 percent, fter  alling  half oint n  May; New  York State's dged  down  to a f a p i e 6.3 percent  in  June,  from 6.4 percent  in  April nd May.  Employment a grew in  both  states n  June, but  at  a slower  pace than in i prior onths.  Consumer  confidence, hough still    an exceptionally w  level,  mproved noticeably  n m t at lo i i July.  Finally, e  boom th in  tourism  shows  no signs f  abating: otel ccupancy rates  in  New  York City o h o climbed  to  a 17-year  high  in  the  second quarter,  nd room  rates ontinued  to  rise t a c a a 10 to 15 percent rate.

Financial  Developments

According to  a survey  of  senior oan  officers   small  and medium l at sized  banks in  the  District, loan demand has softened  over  the  past  two months.  The  largest  ecline  in  activity  curred  in  the d oc residential rtgage  loan  segment, with  demand mo lower  at early 5 percent  of  the  banks surveyed and n 4 steady  at  over 35 percent.  Refinancing  activity r ll ypes  of  loans  continues  to  decline,  hough at  a fo a t t diminishing  ace.  However,  demand  for ommercial and industrial ans  continued  to  increase. p c lo

Banks  reported  modest increases  in  loan  delinquencies n  all ending  categories. oan officers i l L are generally  ore willing   lend  than  two months  ago,  and nearly ll ave maintained  the  same  credit m to a h standards.  Average loan rates  continued  to  rise-they e higher  or  unchanged  at  almost  all f  the ar o participating  nks. The spread between  the  average lending  and deposit  rates  is  steady  at  nearly 0 ba 6 percent  of  the  banks and  narrower  at  close  to  30 percent.

TWELFTH DISTRICT --SAN FRANCISCO

Summary

Reports from Beige Book contacts suggest a  recent pickup in growth in  California and  Washington, partly tempered by a moderation of  the  rapid pace of growth in  other Twelfth District states. Overall, there appears to  have been a  gain in  District manufacturing activity, with the  locus of  growth shifting toward California and  Washington, where residential real estate markets also are firming noticeably. Among services, communications and software development are  particularly strong. Retail sales in the  District generally were  reported to  have increased in  recent months. Wage inflation pressures are evident in  some areas.

Business Sentiment

About three-quarters of  our contacts in  the  District, including almost all  respondents from Northern and  Southern California, expect growth in  their region to  outpace the  national growth rate, which most expect to  be  at  or  above its trend pace over the  next year. Survey respondents expect tightness in  labor markets to  continue for  a  while, and  prospects for inflation are perceived to  have worsened slightly in  the  past few  months.

Retail Trade and Services

Retail sales in  the District generally were reported to  have

increased further in  recent months. Business improved at  food stores in  the Pacific Northwest and  Intermountain states. In Utah, retail sales reportedly were strong in  July, particularly for apparel and autos. In  Washington, strong sales were reported at small retailers, major conventional grocery chains, and  clubwarehouse style stores. Retailers in  the  Puget Sound area also reported difficulties in  recruiting qualified employees at existing wages, given increased job  availability in  other industries.

In  services industries, continued strong job  growth also was reported to  be  adding to  wage and  price pressures. Demand for telecommunications services jumped, and  software development activity expanded in  California and  Washington states. Computer programmers and  systems engineers reportedly are  in  short supply. Tourism activity also has  been strong this summer, leading to significant increases in  hotel room  rates in  cities such as Salt Lake City.

Manufacturing

Overall, there appears to  have been a  gain in  District manufacturing activity in  recent months, although emerging weakness was  reported in  a  few  localities. In  Washington state, aircraft manufacturing is  picking up,  and  electronics components manufacturers are  benefiting from  this and  from the  growth in demand for other types of  business equipment. The rebound in commercial aircraft also reportedly is  boosting orders for

fabricated materials, components, and  machine tools from suppliers in  Oregon, Southern California, and  Nevada. Lumber production reportedly increased in  recent months. Food manufacturing was  down in  a  few  areas where harvests were delayed by  wet  weather. Manufacturing of information processing equipment and  components reportedly was increasing in  some areas and  being scaled back in  others; in  general, such activity is increasing in  California, particularly in  research and development areas such as  Silicon Valley, but there is a moderation of  the  rapid growth in  manufacturing of  computers and related equipment in  the Pacific Northwest and  Intermountain states.

Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries

Agricultural production reportedly was  mixed, depending on the  commodity. In  general, demand for  agricultural products was strong, buoyed by  growing exports, and  prices for  several commodities were reported to  have firmed. The  supply of  cotton was reported to  be  higher than last year, and  tree fruits were plentiful, but  yields on  nut  crops were  medium to  poor. Dairy products prices are  increasing relatively fast.

Real Estate and Construction

Residential home sales and  construction reportedly have strengthened in  Washington and  California, but the  residential market is  cooling a  little in  Oregon, Idaho, and  Utah, following

rapid earlier gains. However, throughout the  Pacific Northwest and Intermountain states, nonresidential real estate vacancy rates are  relatively low, and  building of  offices, commercial space, industrial facilities, and  public infrastructure continued strong. Within California, the  strength in  nonresidential building is  concentrated in  the San  Francisco Bay  Area; many segments of  the Los Angeles area nonresidential real estate market continue to  experience high vacancy rates and  not  much construction.

Financial Institutions

District financial institutions generally reported firm loan demand and  wide credit availability. Asset quality generally remained high, with only a  modest deterioration in  some consumer lines, such as  credit card loans. Financial institutions reported pressures for large wage increases for  information systems jobs and for  entry-level customer service jobs in  those localities with low  unemployment rates.
