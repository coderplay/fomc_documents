Summary

The District onomy  continues  to  grow at  a moderate  pace. Contacts report rowth ec g in employment and sales, lthough  many  firms  still  ce  tight  abor arkets. High fuel a fa l m prices  have bitten nto  several  industries'  ofits.  ales of  existing  omes i pr S h have continued  to slow in  some  regions  in  the  District,  ile  in  other  regions  housing demand wh continues  to  be strong. Loan  demand has increased  modestly,  but  banks continue  to  struggle o  attract t deposits.  A mild  increase  in  some  crop prices  has been  noticed  lately.

Manufacturing  and  Other Business  Activity

Contacts report ound  overall  usiness  conditions  n  the  District,  th  output s b i wi remaining  high  and demand growing. The high-tech  industry,  or xample, continues  to f e flourish, eating  numerous  skilled bs  in  the  District. provider  of  cable-based Internet cr jo A services  is  opening in  Louisville,  d a firm hat ervices  Internet  etailers   opening in an t s r is Memphis;  together hey  will  reate  about 1,450  jobs.  Southwestern  Bell  Wireless  will  reate t c c 500 jobs  by  year-end at  a  new  call enter  in Little ck. c Ro

A few contacts, owever, have noted a slowdown  in  demand h for  their  roducts  over p the  past  few months.  For  example, the  demand for urable  goods, such as automobiles d and  home furnishings, s tapered off lightly. e textile  ndustry ontinues  to  weaken, ha s Th i c with  several  more  clothing anufacturers moving their  obs  abroad.  A printing  lant n m j p i western  Tennessee  closed,  eliminating  25 jobs. 4

Markets for killed  nd  unskilled abor emain tight;  onsequently, eports  that irms s a l r c r f are unable to  expand  production  are becoming  more  frequent.  A  District eel  mill,  ooking st l to  increase  production,  eports hat t annot  find  the  100 workers it eeds.  Problems with r t i c n worker retention nd absenteeism have forced  an automotive parts  producer  to  shut  down a all on-critical  oduction  lines. he  health  care  and  hospitality  dustries  re being hit n pr T in a particularly  rd by the  labor hortage. Nurses and pharmacists  are very  scarce,  leading ha s many  hospitals  o  raise ages  to  attract  uch workers. Casinos,  restaurants nd hotels t w s a

report  staffing  roblems as well,  ith  worker  vacancy rates  reaching p w 25 to  35 percent  in some  cases.

To address this roblem, firms  are using creative echniques, hich include p t w recruiting  ver  the  Internet  nd  outside f  their  ocal reas,  to  find orkers. Also, o  attract o a o l a w t workers,  the  hospitality  dustry  as begun  offering  enefits,  uch as pension plans  and in h b s health  insurance, nd wages  that re $2 to  $3  above the  minimum a a wage.  To retain workers,  some  employers are paying  bonuses  to  workers who  stay  on the  job  more  than  90 days. All  told, owever, overall  age  pressures remain moderate. h w

High fuel rices  continue  to  bite nto  the  trucking nd transportation  ndustries' p i a i profits.  n esponse, many  of  these  firms, ncluding  PS I r i U and FedEx, are tacking n delivery o surcharges-in ome  cases,  of  6 percent  or  more.  In addition,  rucking ompanies  are s t c adopting  efforts  o  improve efficiency d reduce fuel onsumption by cutting  dling  imes t an c i t and organizing  driving  outes  better.  Fuel prices re also  harming many  District sinesses r a bu indirectly.  r example, car  dealers  report hat UV Fo t S sales  are  down  moderately  because of high  gas prices.

Real  Estate and  Construction

Sales of  existing  omes  slowed somewhat h in  March  in  several  areas of he  District, t especially  n  West  Tennessee  and Memphis. i Real estate  agents cite igher  interest  ates h r as a reason. On  the  other  hand, some  areas,  such as parts f  Arkansas and northeast o Mississippi, ntinue  to  experience  strong  housing demand,  with  several  agents in  the co region  reporting   shortage  of  available  ouses, particularly  d-priced  (about  $200,000) a h mi ones. Sales of  new  homes  have continued  to  weaken  somewhat District-wide.

Residential onstruction  icked  up significantly  February,  partly  ecause  of  the c p in b unseasonable weather. Year-to-date  permits  in  February  were above their  ear-earlier y levels.  Commercial  construction  as maintained its oderate growth trend,  especially  n h m i southern parts  of  the  District,  ere  agents note healthy  demand. wh

Banking  and  Finance

Although District nks continue  to  struggle o  raise  deposits,  utstanding  loans  on ba t o the  books continue  to  show  a moderate  increase.  Between  January and March, total deposits  at  a sample  of arge  District nks remained  flat,  ile  total oans  outstanding l ba wh l increased by slightly re  than mo 1 percent.  Almost all f he loan  growth came  from the o t commercial and industrial tegory, hich grew ca w by 2.4  percent.  Real estate  and consumer loans  were  basically  nchanged. u Nevertheless,  all f  these  loan categories ere up o w substantially  om a year  earlier.  or  example, despite  higher  interest  ates, ommercial fr F r c and industrial ans  were lo up  by more than 15 percent, hile  real  estate  loans  grew w by more than 6 percent. Over the  same  period, otal  eposits  grew t d by less  than 1 percent. Confidence in  the  economy  is  often  cited s a  reason for he  continued  loan  growth. a t

Agriculture  and  Natural Resources

Although still latively  w,  prices  for orn,  soybeans  and cotton  seem  to  have re lo c turned  around somewhat during  recent  months, ending an almost  three  year  decline. Wheat  prices  also  remain low  and have shown  no sign  of  recovery. Hog  prices,  n the o other  hand, rebounded  significantly  m year-ago levels  ue to  a  slight  ecrease in fro d d production  and growing demand.

With  favorable pring  weather,  many  farmers are slightly  ead  of  schedule  with s ah field  reparation nd  planting. oil-moisture  evels,  owever, remain low in  Illinois,  ssouri p a S l h Mi and southern Indiana; hey  are reportedly  dequate in  Kentucky and the  southern portion f t a o the  District. e  District nter heat crop  is  in  good-to-excellent ndition n  many  areas.
