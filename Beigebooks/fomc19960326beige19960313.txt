SUMMARY OF COMMENTARY ON CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS BY  FEDERAL RESERVE DISTRICTS

March 1996

TABLE OF  CONTENTS

<!-- missing-text -->

SUMMARY*

Reports from the 12 Federal Reserve districts suggest the national economy grew modestly in January and  February. Over half the  districts cite moderate economic growth or  continuing solid levels of economic activity. Most of the others mention recent improvements, largely reflecting rebounds from weather-related slowdowns earlier in  the year.

Accounts of  manufacturing activity are  mixed. More than half the districts report gains in at least some industries or  sub-regions, but Boston, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and  Dallas suggest production is  either level or  growing more slowly than in  the last report. Retail results generally improved in February, but in  several districts these improvements represent only a partial recovery from weak sales during the holidays and January.

Wage and  price pressures are generally described as subdued, notwithstanding observations of tight labor markets in several districts. Wages are reported to  be increasing at a modest pace. Retail prices are rising only slightly if  at all. Most commodity prices are said to be  steady, stabilizing, or  increasing very little; a  few  are falling.

RETAIL

Districts across the country report weak retail sales in January; most, but not all, note an  encouraging pick-up in  February. Severe winter weather contributed to  January's slow pace, particularly on  the East Coast. February's uptick in sales was not seen in  parts of the west and  mid-west, where the San Francisco, St. Louis, and  Minneapolis districts note continued

sluggishness. Durable goods and electronics are typically selling better than apparel, although some respondents observe a  rise in demand for selected clothing items. Contacts in  New  York and  Chicago report the largest sales gains in stores at the high end of the market.

Retailers in  a  majority of districts are  optimistic that sales will pick up in  the next few  months. The outlook for those in the Cleveland, San Francisco, Dallas, and  Minneapolis districts is more guarded. Upward movements in retail prices continue to  be limited. Reports from Boston, Atlanta, and St. Louis indicate vendor prices generally remain stable.

Auto dealers in  the Philadelphia, Chicago, Cleveland, and  Kansas City districts report improved sales in February, following a  disappointing January. Dallas notes sluggish sales in  both months, leaving inventories larger than desired. Contacts in the Chicago, Cleveland, and  Kansas City districts express more optimism about this spring's auto sales than those in Dallas, Minneapolis, and  Philadelphia.

TOURISM

Excellent skiing conditions on  the East Coast boosted tourism in the Boston and  Richmond districts. Atlanta reports strong tourism and  convention business, particularly in Florida, where northerners are fleeing to escape harsher than usual winter weather. Minneapolis notes a  drop in tourism because of poor skiing conditions in  Montana, an  unfavorable Canadian exchange rate, and  the temporary federal shutdown of South Dakota's national parks and monuments.

OTHER NON-FINANCIAL SERVICES

In  most districts surveying business services, demand accelerated in February from a  seasonal or  weather-related lull in January; elsewhere, services continued to expand at a  good pace over both months. Dallas notes gains in accounting and  transportation while San Francisco reports growing exports of high-tech services like telecommunications, software, and financial

consulting. The  demand for temporary workers picked up in Richmond, Chicago, and  Dallas, with Chicago noting ongoing labor shortages and  Richmond reporting that temporary workers' wages rose faster than the general price level over the last year.

MANUFACTURING

Manufacturing activity has  been mixed but fairly flat on  average. Several Federal Reserve Banks in the middle of the country (Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas) report slightly slower sales and  orders, while the majority of districts to the east (Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta) indicate a  slight strengthening since the latter part of 1995 or the beginning of 1996. Only the San Francisco report has a  generally positive tone for recent months, based largely on  trends for  machinery and  equipment.

A  number of districts report growing demand for capital goods, notably industrial machinery, with Cleveland, Atlanta, and  Chicago citing a  boost from exports. Sales of  electronic and  computer-related equipment appear to be rising, although Minneapolis reports a  slowing rate of growth for computer components, and  Dallas notes a  drop-off in demand for  memory chips and microprocessors. St. Louis and  Dallas indicate robust markets for cement. Auto-related and  apparel demand are widely reported to  be sluggish, and  paper mills are experiencing declining sales according to contacts in  several districts.

Manufacturers throughout the country report little or  diminished materials cost pressures. Paper prices in  particular are falling, and lumber prices are either falling or  have ceased to rise. Several districts note growing wage pressures or  tight markets for some categories of  manufacturing workers. Overall wage inflation reportedly remains moderate, however. Philadelphia and  Richmond report recent declines in  finished goods prices, while most other districts indicate little or  no  increase. Several districts attribute the modest size of  upward price movements to competitive conditions in  addition to the lack of cost pressures.

REAL ESTATE AND CONSTRUCTION

All districts report increased interest and activity in residential real estate; most also report increased residential sales. Among those with higher sales, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas indicate low-priced and  subsidized houses have done better than higher-priced homes. Upstate New  York and  Philadelphia continue having excess inventories of housing stock. Prices are said to  be stable in  most districts, but appear to be showing some increase in the Kansas City (especially for low-priced homes) and Richmond districts and  in  the  San Francisco Bay  area. Richmond, Minneapolis, and  Kansas City are seeing an  increase in new  residential construction, and  San Francisco notes increased construction of  apartment buildings in  Arizona.

Commercial real estate markets have also experienced increased activity. New  York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and  Dallas report rising demand for commercial space. Vacancy rates are said to have dropped in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and  San Francisco districts. Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas, and  San Francisco report increased commercial construction in their districts.

Contacts in  all districts anticipate a  strong and  active spring season. Despite some concern about interest rates and  about overbuilding in selected areas, respondents are optimistic about both residential and  commercial real estate activity during the upcoming months.

FINANCIAL SERVICES

Loan demand appears to  be  increasing in the  majority of districts, although it  has eased in  Cleveland and California. Most districts indicate that demand for  commercial loans has risen more than the demand for consumer credit. Contacts in  New  York, Atlanta, and  Cleveland report slightly higher loan delinquencies. Respondents in all districts reporting on  bank activity mention a  surge in  refinancing activity.

AGRICULTURE AND  NATURAL RESOURCES

Arctic cold, drought, and  fire have damaged the winter wheat crop and pasturage in  much of the St. Louis, Kansas City and  Dallas districts. In addition, in  the Richmond district, parts of the Pacific Northwest, and the eastern Dakotas, floods or  heavy snows have also hurt crops. With uncertain prospects for  the 1996 harvest and tight global inventories, grain prices are at their highest levels in  many years. While these conditions are benefiting grain farmers in  the parts of the Minneapolis and  San Francisco districts that have adequate moisture, ranchers are caught in a  squeeze. With the ratio of livestock prices to grain prices unusually low, the  Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas districts report declines in  ranch profits. In  Minneapolis, bankers reportedly expect a  rise in  ranch liquidations. Beef exports to Canada and  Asia are  helping to support producers in the San Francisco district.

In other natural resource industries, conditions are mixed. Iron mines in the Minneapolis district shipped at the highest level in  over a  decade, while output from nonferrous mines stayed stable. Energy prices are reportedly volatile, with natural gas and  fuel oil prices fluctuating at high levels, while crude oil prices are relatively weak. Dallas and  Minneapolis report strong gas and  oil exploration activity, but in  Kansas City and  Dallas, the operating rig count remains low.

FIRST DISTRICT -BOSTON

Economic activity continues to  be sluggish in the First District. Retail results range widely, with apparel and  hardware stores seeing sales decline. Other stores are doing better, but all express concern about consumer confidence. Manufacturing activity is generally level with a  year ago, although some respondents have seen sales rise. Price pressures continue to  be  moderate. The residential real estate market is  picking up  in  most of New England, with home  prices stable. Mutual fund firms in the region continue to expand their assets under management and  increase employment. Retail

First District retailers report mixed results in January and February. Sales activity compared with year-earlier levels ranged from  double-digit declines to an  increase of  over 10 percent. Apparel and  hardware contacts suffered the  most serious losses, but the apparel merchants saw  a  slight improvement in late February and  hope for sales equal to a  year earlier throughout the spring. By  contrast, non-apparel non-hardware retailers anticipate sales growth of  4  to 15  percent over the next several months. Even those doing well agree that consumers' worries about job layoffs and the economy are causing them to  postpone discretionary purchases. In response, contacts are generally keeping inventories low and employment stable. Wage increases of  3  to 5  percent are planned for this year. Only one contact plans significant store expansions.

Retailers report most vendor prices remain stable; by  exception, the price of  paper has fallen 10 percent over the last few  months, following a steep rise in  the first half of  last year. Lumber prices are starting to rise, in anticipation of  the spring construction season. Contacts note increased profits in 1995.

Tourist offices report strong activity this winter throughout the region, thanks to exceptional skiing conditions. International travelers remain the fastest-growing and  most lucrative segment of  visitors to New England.

Manufacturing

Most First District manufacturing contacts report fairly flat sales relative to a  year ago. By  exception, sales of  industrial parts, equipment used in  commercial construction, cabinetry, and  some consumer nondurables have risen. A  number of  respondents indicate recent swings in business. Some makers of  consumer products report that sales were weak in January and stronger in February, a  pattern they attribute to weather fluctuations. A parts manufacturer is benefitting from an end to temporary shutdowns of automotive assembly plants. Other respondents, including a  paper manufacturer and two firms supplying discount chains, report being hurt by  greater-thananticipated reductions in  inventories on  the part of their customers.

Most manufacturers report that selling prices are flat or  up modestly, except for a  decline in paper product prices since late 1995. Trends for materials costs vary: contacts indicate rising prices for specialty chemicals and  plastics and resins, falling prices for wood  pulp and  most grades of paper, mixed trends for polyester products, and  stabilized prices for lumber and cotton (although the level of cotton prices reportedly remains high). Some manufacturers lament that strong competition is limiting their ability to raise prices, while others expect higher profit margins this year because of weaker pressures from  materials costs.

Half the firms contacted report that employment is little changed from its year-earlier level, the remainder report decreases. Any  new  hiring tends to  be selective rather than across-the-board. Several contacts indicate growing wage pressures. Capital spending patterns vary widely. The

largest increases are reported by  businesses that are  developing new  products or shifting production locations. Other contacts indicate a pause or decline following last year's heavy capital investments.

Residential Real Estate

The  residential real estate market in  New England is reported to  be doing well. After a  slow winter, with low  activity almost everywhere (caused partly by  the large amount of  snow), business has been picking up. Respondents report increased interest, high attendance at open houses, and more people putting their houses on the market. Although an  increase in sales has not yet followed, all contacts are optimistic about the spring season.

Prices have been stable, with no  major changes in either direction, and contacts do not anticipate any  large changes in the near future. While inventories of existing houses are in line with the level of activity and sales, respondents report overbuilding and excess supplies of  new  homes in some areas. Interest rates remain low, despite small increases in some places recently, and credit is widely available. Most contacts express "guarded optimism." The  major worry is that interest rates will increase.

The state of the local economy remains a  concern in some areas. Connecticut and  Maine continue to  do  poorly. Conditions in  Vermont, Rhode Island, and the suburbs of  Boston have improved, however.

Nonbank Financial Services

Investment management firms report increased assets under management in the first two  months of  1996. Sales of  equity funds were very strong, but bond funds were in  net liquidation. Most respondents raised employment in  the first two  months of  1996 and  plan further increases during the rest of  the year.

SECOND DISTRICT--NEW YORK

Reports on Second  District onomic  conditions ere mixed, but  on balance were more ec w positive  han in recent months. t Beginning with  the more  upbeat developments,  retail  ales s strengthened  considerably  in  February. Moreover, robust  leasing  activity d  to improvement  in le Manhattan's  commercial real  estate  market. Finally,  ggregate loan  demand a has strengthened  over the  past  two months.  In  contrast,  eports n homebuilding and manufacturing activity  re mixed. r o we The  market for  new  homes in  the  New  York City-Northern ew N Jersey  area improved, while  the upstate  market did not.  Conversely,  manufacturing output  increased in  the Buffalo  region but declined  in  the  New  York City  area during  February.

Consumer Spending

District  tail  ales trengthened  in  February,  following  isappointing  anuary results.  earre s s d J Y over-year  comparable-store  sales  gains  ranged from +2 to +10 percent  and  averaged roughly 6 percent  in  February,  nearly wice anuary's  average result. early  all  ontacts  report hat ebruary t J N c t F sales  were on plan  and inventories  ere generally t  desired  levels. w a A broad range of  products --including  etter pparel, ome  furnishings, d commodity  consumables b a h an --sold  well.  Several  retail contacts  noted  that ompetitive rice-cutting  s widespread during  January;  in  contrast,  ebruary c p wa F saw a return  to  more  "normal"  pricing atterns. p

Construction &amp; Real Estate

Manhattan's commercial real  estate  market improved in  January.  Although  leasing  activity in  Midtown  Manhattan  rose  to  a five onth m high, the  vacancy rate  was virtually  changed  at un 14.1 percent. In Downtown Manhattan, leasing  activity s  fairly isk or  the  third onth  in  a row, wa br f m pushing  the  vacancy rate  down  to  24.9  percent  in  January,  from 25.1 percent  in  December and 25.4 percent  in  November.

The  market for  new  homes has picked  up in  the  New  York City and Northern New  Jersey areas,  but  upstate  New  York's  depressed  market showed  no  improvement. Homebuilders in  the

New  York  City rea,  which includes ong Island nd the  lower  Hudson  Valley, eport hat ales  are a L a r t s higher  than a year  ago; one contact escribed  the  market as "perky".  Similarly, ntacts  in  Northern d co New  Jersey  report ome  pickup  in  both traffic  d buying activity    the  past  six eeks, but  this s s an in w i compared  to  an exceptionally  eak market in  late  1995.  Also,  some  expressed concern that he w t pickup  in  activity  y just  e a temporary  spike, ith  the  recent  uptick  n  mortgage rates  motivating ma b w i potential  uyers with  a sense of  urgency. b

Homebuilders in  upstate  New  York  report o recent  improvement; they  say demand n for  new homes continues  to be  depressed  by corporate and  government  down-sizing and  pervasive consumer pessimism. Moreover, high inventories f unsold existing omes o h --partly ue  to d corporations nloading  homes  of  relocated mployees  onto  the  market -- re  pushing down  prices u e a and competing with  the  new-home market. Only  the low-end of  the  market,  particularly  bsidized su units, s  performing reasonably  well.  Contacts in  both New i York and New  Jersey  believe  that he t market is  too  weak to  support  any increase  in  selling  rices. p

Manufacturing

Buffalo  area  purchasing  managers  report teady growth in  manufacturing output  in  January s and  February. In  contrast,  urchasers  in  the  New  York City  area  report  fairly arp  downturn in p a sh local  manufacturing activity  n February  (and  a  more i modest  decline  in activity  utside  the o manufacturing sector). Both  surveys show  commodity price pressures easing in February, continuing ecent  trends. r

Nearly  two-thirds  f  District  nufacturers  polled  in  a recent  Federal  Reserve Bank  of  New o ma York survey  expect  unit ales  to  increase  over  the  next  six onths, with  exports  expected to  grow s m more rapidly  han  domestic sales.  Ninety  percent  of  the  respondents anticipate  hat rices ill  ither t t p w e remain unchanged  or  decline;  owever, one-quarter  reported  that hey  had raised  prices ecently. h t r Wages are expected to  rise  to  4 percent  and capital  pending will e similar  o  that f  1995. 3 s b t o

Other Business  Activity

Unemployment rates  in  the  district  re essentially changed we un in  January. New  York State's rate  held  steady  at  6.2  percent, hile  New  Jersey's  rate  edged  down  to  6.5  percent.  Both states w reported  sharp drops in  payroll mployment  in  January, but  these were  attributed  o  temporary e t factors:   blizzard  hat it uring  the  survey  week  and a building  orkers'  strike  n  New  York City. a t h d w i

Consumer confidence for the Middle  Atlantic  region (New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania)  rebounded  in  February,  after alling   its owest  level  in  more  than 2 years. Still, f to l residents  remain  exceptionally  essimistic bout job prospects. More  large  corporations  have p a announced  workforce  reductions n  New  York State: RW,  General Electric, tionwide,  Bausch  and i T Na Lomb,  Pratt  and Lambert, Deluxe Corporation,  Reader's Digest  and UPS announced  layoffs  otaling t nearly  2,000  workers.

Financial Developments

Demand for  nearly  all ypes  of  loans  strengthened  over  the  past  two months, according  to t a survey of  senior oan officers  t  small  and medium-sized  banks.  In general, oan  demand l a l was stronger  at  more  than 25 percent  of  the  banks surveyed and steady  at  over 55 percent.  The largest increase  in  activity  curred  in  the  consumer  loan  segment, with  demand oc higher  at  nearly 5 percent 4 of  the  banks and steady  at  close  to  40 percent.  Refinancing  activity  r ll ypes  of  loans  increased, fo a t and is  now  higher  at  approximately 0 percent  of  the  banks. 4

Average  loan  rates  were steady  or  lower  at  nearly  all f  the  reporting anks, resulting  n  a o b i narrower spread between  lending  and  deposit  rates  at almost 65  percent  of  the banks. Loan delinquencies  were  higher at 20  percent of the banks  and  steady at 70  percent,  with the nonresidential  ortgage  segment  experiencing  the largest ncrease  in  delinquencies.  Although m i several  of  the  survey  participants tightened credit  tandards,  nearly  60 percent  of  the  banks were s just  s or  more willing  o  lend  than  they  were two months  ago. a t

The  District onomy has  marginally  mproved  since he  last  eport, though  nly ec i t r al o construction  tivity s  shown any  broad-based  rowth  since he irst  he ear. ac ha g t f oft y Housing  sales re eported  o e  strong  n  many areas,  ommercial  construction  tivity a r t b i c ac has  been  especially  brant, d  suppliers  f ommercial  construction  terials d vi an o c ma an equipment  have  seen  decidedly  igher  rder nd  production  umbers. h o a n
